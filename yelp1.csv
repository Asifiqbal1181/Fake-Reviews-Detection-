923,0,3,12/8/2014,The food at snack is a selection of popular Greek dishes. The appetizer tray is good as is the Greek salad. We were underwhelmed with the main courses. There are 4-5 tables here so it's sometimes hard to get seated.,-1
924,0,3,5/16/2013,"This little place in Soho is wonderful. I had a lamb sandwich and a glass of wine. The price shocked me for how small the serving was, but then again, this is Soho. The staff can be a little snotty and rude, but the food is great, just don't expect world-class service.",-1
925,0,4,7/1/2013,"ordered lunch for 15 from Snack last Friday. Â On time, nothing missing and the food was great. Â I have added it to the regular company lunch list, as everyone enjoyed their meal.",-1
926,0,4,7/28/2011,"This is a beautiful quaint little restaurant on a pretty street. Â If you're strolling through soho around lunchtime, this would be a great place to stop for a bite. I heard the reviews about the lamb sandwich, so I had to try it. I'm very happy that i did. Every single ingredient - from the bread to the onions and tomatoes, the lamb and the sauce - was delicious. These four stars are well deserved because of the tasty sandwich and great ambiance. Â I would recommend this place to anyone.",-1
927,0,4,11/1/2010,"Snack is great place for a Â casual sit down lunch- especially on a cold winter day. Â In many ways the restaurant mirrors the food- simple yet unique. Â The avgolemono soup was lemony perfection and the butter bean salad hearty yet light. Â The greek coffee is different...they sweeten it with honey which makes for an interesting thickness and sweet spice. I definitely plan on going back for dinner. Â If the small space doesn't suit you their sister restaurant Snack Taverna in the West Village is just as good, if not better...and more ""upscale"" with waiters who make you feel well taken care of.",-1
928,0,4,9/2/2009,"A solid 4 stars for this greek food spot. Â If you're a fan of lamb like I am, you must come here and try the lamb sandwich. Â Amazingly tender and juicy with onions and arugula. Â Also had a good greek salad.",-1
929,0,4,8/25/2009,"Let me start with a shout-out to everyone who is boosting the mint lemonade. That stuff is super tasty. Â I refuse to believe you can get fresher, more delicious Greek food for your dollar. Â  I sport the lunch here regularly: huge sandwiches filled with marinated vegetables or succulent meats (the lamb is particularly choice) on a floury ciabatta with an ideal crust-crunch to soft-inner-womb. Â  The cold meze options are favorites. Â I know that anyone can take good feta, cover it with salt, pepper, olive oil, and dish it up with some olives and tomatoes, but the quality and proportion of each of those ingredients is what makes it special here. Â Heaven. You can rock a sandwich for $7.50 to $9.50 or grab bigger meals for no more than the mid-teens. Â Get it done.",-1
930,0,4,5/20/2007,Love this place! Â Try the Chicken sandwich or the Roasted Chicken. Â Those are winners every time. Â Really delicious and worth the wait.,-1
931,0,4,12/27/2005,"My friend and I were intrigued by the nightly entree special, ""Little Shoes,"" (eggplant stuffed with ground sirloin), and so we decided to eat at Snack. Although very tiny, we were able to stand while we waited and have a glass of wine at the narrow 'bar.' I absolutely loved the atmosphere, but I was a bit disappointed to find out that they were out of the entree special by the time we sat down. My substitute entree, Veg. Moussaka, was hearty and good, but cinnamon overpowered the other flavors. My friend had the stuffed tomato and green pepper plate, which I liked better.",-1
932,0,5,5/9/2014,"Stopped in for lunch today and couldn't believe how delicious everything was! My boyfriend and I shared an avgolemono soup, lamb sandwich, spanakoptikia and baklava. Everything came out super quickly and far exceeded our expectations. Â The service was wonderful too! We will definitely be back!",-1
933,0,5,1/21/2014,pretty cool place...good food...good people,-1
934,0,5,1/20/2014,"all around good place, cozy, I came in and didn't have a huge appetite but just stuck to the appetizers...which my friend and I did the combo platter of and we were more than full with it.",-1
935,0,5,1/31/2011,Fabulous Authentic Greek Food!!! This little spot is bold with great flavors. Knowledgable host that describes the layers of a food like you were sitting in the kitchen watching the preparation. If you are a true foodie you don't want to miss Snack!,-1
936,0,5,7/7/2008,Perfection. Â Snack has become my favorite late lunch/early dinner spot. Â Make sure to try the butter beans!!!,-1
937,0,4,10/15/2014,"Tiny little place, but very good food. Pastitsio was especially good.",1
938,0,5,10/10/2014,I had the braised lamb sandwich and was one of the best sandwiches of my life. Do yourself a favour and try this place! Friendly service and cosy atmosphere.,1
939,0,3,10/3/2014,"This spot is close to my job so I decided to check it out for lunch. The prices are just about what you would expect for Soho/""South Village"" sit-down lunch prices; my meal came out to $20 for a mint lemonade and a decent-sized salad. I ordered what I think may have been a special, a roasted chicken & vegetable salad. The chicken was unbelievably dry, to the point where I had tough time chewing without choking a bit. It was served on a bed of arugula which could have chopped a little finer as it was in full, hard to eat pieces. When I eat a salad, I expect it to be cut down to make for easier bites. Not necessarily a chopped salad, just pieces that will actually fit in your mouth without chopping it up yourself. Basically, I don't want to use a knife to eat a salad. However, service was friendly & quick and the restaurant itself was comfortable, albeit tiny. I would go back to try something else, but probably not for a salad.",1
940,0,4,9/16/2014,"For lunch, my friend and I had: -Lamb sandwich, juicy and flavorful. -Roasted beet salad, pretty big portion. Good thing my friend shared it with me; otherwise I think I would so bored eating only beets, and a few leaves of greens. -Classic Greek Avolemono, basically a very tangy chicken broth with orzo. My friend really likes it at this place. The place is small. There are only 6 tables, but they do delivery. Good service if you decide to dine in.",1
941,0,5,8/10/2014,"Needed a quick, healthy light ""lunch"" and this place was perfect! Next time I'll definitely have yo plan better so I can try some of their hardier sandwiches and dishes. ALL the food looked AMAZING and the items we had were DELICIOUS!",1
942,0,4,6/17/2014,Their artichoke chicken salad is good and plenty.,1
943,0,5,5/24/2014,"Some good Big Greek cooking!! Came to City on a gorgeous Sunday after a brutal winter one of the first clear sunny crisp Sundays to walk about Soho one of my fav's to do... And we were hungry and decided to try this hole in a wall gem! Â Literally a hole in the wall which I think is perfect I believe they have 5 tables and it's so small the restroom is down the hall! The food is delicious...had the hummus, warm pita, lamb stew was fresh & just perfect, pastitsio (sp?) was perfect and portion were just enough! They dimmed the lights lit candles and it was a perfect way to end a Sunday...full tummy, wine, a real gem! The service is good hard not to be in such a small place! You feel like your in someone's home with other guest - the cooking is down home good!",1
944,0,4,5/21/2014,"Needed a quick bite and stopped here because of the reviews. Â It's really cute and small inside. Had the roasted sandwich and it was good. Â Service was very friendly, too. Â Nice place to break from shopping",1
945,0,5,4/10/2014,Food was delicious and service was great. Good atmosphere for a quick bite alone or to catch up with friends.,1
946,0,5,3/29/2014,"Awesome hole in the wall place to grab a quick bite. Great music, great vibes and great service. The lentil soup and steak sandwich was absolutely to die for. The space is really small yet cozy.",1
947,0,5,3/21/2014,"I love this place! Great soups and Greek salad and spinach pie and tuna sandwiches. I've been a fan for years. The dining ""room"" is small and cramped but prices are low and the food is always fresh and delicious. I've only been there for lunch and look forward to going back for dinner. Services is fine -- not special - but more than adequate for a special little SOHO secret gem",1
948,0,5,3/8/2014,The food is amazing! The service is equally amazing! My friends and I are definitely coming back to this place.,1
949,0,4,3/1/2014,"Quick, delicious and filling. After a few hours of shopping in SoHo we were starving. They couldn't accommodate the three of us at first (it's tiny), but took my number and called us back like 15 mins later. Fresh ingredients and the flavors hit all the right notes. The pastitsio was delicate, the hummus was creamy and the dolmades werent too dense, or tart. Service was with a smile, too. Definitely good to try on a mellow Saturday afternoon.",1
950,0,4,1/24/2014,"Delicious, consistent, well-priced. Food tastes clean and feels like its made with love.",1
951,0,5,1/18/2014,"Really quaint little ""hole in the wall"" kind of stop. Only a block away from the avenue of the Americas in Soho. There's only 4 tables for about 8 people at anytime but it didn't seem too much of a problem at 1:30pm on a Saturday. Really freshly authentic Greek food and pure cane sugar soft drinks were definitely something different. Definitely worth 5 stars. Relatively cheap as well.",1
952,0,5,1/16/2014,Delicious lamb sandwich,1
953,0,4,10/17/2013,"So... as you may notice from some of my other reviews... i am not the healthiest eater (.. I DO try). Â Snack has about the BEST Greek Salad I have ever tasted. Â Big juicy tomatoes... crunchy fresh cucumbers...fantastic olive oil dressing. Â I don't eat greek salads typcially - but I do eat them at Snack...Actually, I crave them when visting New York. Â You should try it!",1
954,0,4,10/2/2013,"Novelty meets Mediterranean meets SoHo. This place can only squeeze in about 8-10 at 2 seater tables; and I do mean squeeze! But its a money spot for lunch or a quick on the go bite. Go for their lamb sandwich, the dressings are fantastic flavor pairings. If you're looking for something lighter for both your stomach and your wallet, try the soup. The Mediterranean sandwich is full of veggies too. Great variety, cute location, good food.",1
955,0,2,9/10/2013,"Been meaning to try this place for a while-highly recommended by a friend. Had the tuna sandwich...good but got TERRIBLY SICK after word. Also, sage tea was nice.",1
956,0,5,8/22/2013,"If you're looking for authentic Greek and a cozy atmosphere, this is the place. Seriously, it's cozy. There are maybe 5-6 tables in this place. However, despite it's tininess, the server was very helpful to each and every customer in the restaurant. My girlfriend and I had to wait a few minutes to be seated but he took the time to explain some of the Greek drinks and menu items to us. The service was fantastic and and the food was prepared very quickly, and though I'm new to the city, I'm certain it will stay on my list for a very long time as being the best Greek I have ever had. We ordered the Tzatziki cucumber yogurt, Houmus, and Tiropitakia cheese triangles. I strongly recommend this place!",1
957,0,4,8/2/2013,"Great find in SoHo. Â We could have been satisfied with the huge Greek salad and side of hummus, but also got a chicken souvlaki sandwich special that was killer. Â It's a small place but really charming and worth checking out.",1
958,0,4,6/23/2013,"The taramosalata is to die for. Â I recommend the Shrimp Santorini. Also, my good friend who is Greek loves this restaurant and says it tastes very authentic!",1
959,0,4,4/30/2013,"What a pleasant little shop. Tiny, cute, liquor license, credit cards accepted, intimate....perfection ensues We went for a light dinner and ordered the roasted red pepper salad and the lamb koftikas. The salad had tons of red peppers, a bit potent, but very good. But the Lamb Koftikas, omg, have you ever wondered what you're doing wrong? What's that missing secret ingredient? Well look no further, it's pine nuts. How did I not know this, add it to meatballs and you're in for a treat. The wait staff was extremely pleasant and made wandering randomly into Snack a great experience. I will have to come back when I can eat more than half of an entree.",1
960,0,4,4/16/2013,"This place is TINY! I think it fits 10 people max. Keep that in mind when considering to come here on a weekend night. The food was great though and setting romantic! I recommend coming here if you're in the area and there is an open seat. Oh word of warning, but i guess it's standard for smaller shop establishments in NYC, i saw a roach on the wall here.",1
961,0,5,4/10/2013,Lamb sandwich... mmm... eat here.,1
962,0,2,3/25/2013,I ordered the spinach pies. Not very good. Soggy. No real taste. Also got the artichoke chicken salad. Portion size was huge but chicken was dry Â  Â  .,1
963,0,5,3/2/2013,"This tiny cafe on Thompson has been a favorite of mine for years, and I'll tell you why. Everything is fresh and the attention to detail makes it a keeper. The lamb sammie on ciabatta is melt in your mouth chunks of lamb, with roasted onions and pretty much to die for. It's big enough for two gals to share, for sure. My favorite soup of all time, they rock here -- the Avgolemono is super lemony and perfect, with al dente orzo. Served with toasted slivers of olive oil coated fresh bread. And in every take away bag then toss little twists of waxed paper filled with a few Jordan almonds. Pretty adorable, since I'm a sucker for these little touches.",1
964,0,4,2/20/2013,I was impressed! This was my first time picking up food from Snack. I had no idea it was a Greek place after walking by a few times. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality at this tiny but quaint eatery. I'm half Greek so I've had a lot of Avgolemeno soup - I got the Snack version and was totally blown away! I loved the big orzo rice and the flavor was perfectly lemony and super delicious. The Chicken Artichoke salad was WOW! Its huge and there was a generous amount of roasted chicken and all of the other fresh and tasty toppings. My minor suggestion for the kitchen would be to cook the potatoes just a little more. But that didn't affect the overall amazingness of this salad. This will definitely be a place I will be visiting again!,1
965,0,4,2/14/2013,"Ohhh Snack. I love you, Snack. I order from here often since it's close to my work and their delivery is always precise and on-time. Their avgolemono and vegetarian souvlaki are fantastic and I hope that one day, maybe, I'll be able to replicate their giant beans in that delicious dill tomato sauce. I haven't yet eaten in the store itself, but I'm sure it'll be just as enjoyable as digging into my brown paper sack for the best (and still reasonably priced) lunch I can find in SoHo.",1
966,0,3,12/19/2012,"I don't understand the whole ""You can't order off the lunch menu if you're sitting down for dinner"" thing, especially when your restaurant is empty. Â You'd think they'd be glad for the chance to earn a tip and the glass of wine or 2 I might order... but I guess not. Â -1 star for that... The lamb sandwich to go though was pretty awesome. Â I'd go back and try a sit down dinner, but I guess I wouldn't be able to have that sandwich again.",1
967,0,4,12/15/2012,"Perfect for what the name implies: great butter bean salad and even better winter soups. Perfect for dates or other one-on-one dinner. I wouldn't bring a part of more than four here - it's exclusively single tables and seats maybe 14 all together. Really a gem, especially because it doesn't advertise itself as a Greek restaurant, but the food is definitely Mediterranean.",1
968,0,4,11/16/2012,"Really delicious sandwich- had the lamb. It was enormous and I was able to eat it in two meals. Tight though, so I'd recommend grabbing and going. Definitely a neat block to visit for lunch if you ever get bored of Sullivan st. Plus they accept credit cards!",1
969,0,2,10/25/2012,"I went to this place once before and LOVED it. I bragged about it to a friend and took her to eat there last week. Well, it wasn't good a second time around and that is a shame. We ordered the tuna salad, skordalia (garlic dip) and chicken souvlaki sandwich. The tuna salad was fine - I really can't complain about that. The skordalia was not fine and was more like soup than a dip. So watery and not authentic at all. The chicken souvlaki sandwich was ice cold. Like it was in a freezer. Also to add to the disappointment was the super weird waitress. Maybe she was overwhelmed or something..I don't know. Â Anyway, can't say I'd go back and that's a bummer because I really liked it the first time.",1
970,0,4,10/7/2012,"Delicious, savory, creamy--try the pastitsio, vegetarian mousaka, stuffed grape leaves, baklava. Lunch-wise, I wouldn't recommend the artichoke/chicken salad--the big chunks of chicken resembled the big chunks of potato. Lovely atmosphere--just a few tables lined up along a mirrored wall, across from imported canned goods. Intimate at night, and bright and charming at lunch.",1
971,0,4,9/16/2012,Super small but it felt cozy rather than cramped. Get the lamb sandwich!!!,1
972,0,1,8/12/2012,"Lacklustre service, soggy lukewarm spinach pie and two-day-old cucumber salad. Go to Local instead!",1
973,0,3,8/3/2012,"I am Greek, and a huge fan of Greek food, so a bit of a tough critic, but Snack is very good. Not fantastic, but pretty good. The tzatziki and hummus is awesome, but make sure to get extra pita!",1
974,0,4,7/25/2012,"A friend recommended I try Snack - was really surprised at how much I liked it. The grape leaves were really good. I don't know what they put in them, but I'm pretty sure they laced them w/ amazing. The feta appetizer special equally good. Only ""eh"" was the grilled octopus, WAY overcooked, almost like it was day old microwaved. But, 4 out of 5 shared appetizers is a win for me.",1
975,0,2,6/29/2012,"Followed the great Yelp reviews to grab a sandwich here for lunch. Didn't realize it opens at 12, showed up at 11:50. The person working there opened the door and said they wouldn't be open for 10 minutes, which didn't seem like a big deal. Then she kept telling people it would be a few more minutes, until we were finally allowed in close to 12:05. I ordered the chicken sandwich and lemonade. When there was some confusion with whether we were paying together or separate, the same person who begrudgingly let us in expressed exasperation - she clearly wasn't having a good day. After we sorted the order, she told us to wait outside, in the heat - even though there were no other people in the place! The sandwiches were finally ready after 12:20. Snotty service, half an hour wait, $14 for a sandwich and a tiny lemonade... and the sandwich was cold, on a very tough roll and lacking flavor - I couldn't even finish it. Maybe I picked the wrong thing on the menu, but I won't be going back here. The Potbelly sandwich I had for $5.50 last night was much better.",1
976,0,5,5/31/2012,YUMS! I just tried the Carp Roe and it's sooooooooooooo good! I like the Feta with Tomato too! The Combination Platter is the jam.,1
977,0,3,5/13/2012,"I'm going to start off by admitting my rating may be influenced by the fact that I have to go way out of my way to get to this place. So I might be judging it more harshly because I expect it to be better given the effort to get there. Service is great. Everyone in the cozy restaurant is very friendly and helpful when it comes to suggestions of what to order. The place is probably best for a quiet lunch date as it is cramped. I definitely wouldn't come with a group of kids or girlfriends during a shopping excursion. I find the lamb sandwich incredibly overpriced (around $11) and definitely not worth it. It was pretty darn small and stingily filled. It has a lot of flavor while being flavorless. That is, I feel like the actual ingredients are kind of flavorless, the lamb, the vegetables, etc. but all the seasoning is an overpowering mishmash of tastes so you end up with something indistinct. The spanakopitakia are tiny little triangles of yummy, flaky, buttery, spinach-y goodness. They might be a little rich for some but I love them. Definitely great as an appetizer or as a light snack on their own. The baklava is good. Not spectacular but everyone has their own preferences when it comes to baklava. I find the layers a bit too dry and I wish the flavor was a little more nutty and less dependent on spices for taste. Overall, I'm not sure if I'll be back but it's a nice place to stop in if you're in the area. I will say that the times I've been in I've seen people ordering salads which looked delicious so maybe that's their specialty.",1
978,0,2,4/30/2012,"Stopped in for lunch takeout during work. Â I asked the server what is better: Roasted Vegetable Sandwhich or Vegetable Souvlaki. Â He replied boastfully with the Vegetarian Souvlaki. Â  Apparently he enjoys tzatziki sauce running out of his pita, down his hands and all of his face. Â Unfortunately, I do not. Â The taste didn't make up for the mess!",1
979,0,4,4/11/2012,"Delicious. Â Get there early for a seat, or better yet, order take-out and snag a table down the block in the corner park. Favorites: Â Artichoke Chicken Salad, Feta Cheese Meze --",1
980,0,5,3/30/2012,"I was trying to wait until after my headrush died down before posting, but it has been an hour and I am still relaxed and in a great mood from the Lamb sandwich. Â It was fantastic, got it to go.",1
981,0,4,3/13/2012,mmm very tasty. Kind of cramped though.,1
982,0,3,3/5/2012,"Nice little Greek restaurant that serves authentic Greek dishes but don't go if you're looking for a gyro (the only type of Greek food I'd ever had). Its a very small, quaint restaurant (seats a total of 10 people). The food was very good (I had a veal and rice dish) but the portions were just a little small.",1
983,0,4,2/22/2012,"a whole in the wall, but get there outside regular lunch hours and it's all good Salads are nice portions and very tasty Mint lemonade is delicious very tasty lamb meatballs I guess if you go there more than 10 times, it's a good sign. nice staff too no 5 stars because it's quite impossible to go there with more than one person",1
984,0,4,2/13/2012,Small place big on taste. Stopped in with my wife after shopping. Absolutely delicious. very friendly waitress too,1
985,0,5,1/5/2012,most neighborhood-y place in the neighborhood.,1
986,0,3,1/5/2012,"This place is nice but the menu is very limited. Food is very good, as is the service. Space is really small, so make sure to get a reservation.",1
987,0,4,12/18/2011,We would love to come here more often. But its a small place and there is always a long wait. We like everything we've tried and will definitely come back again.,1
988,0,3,12/13/2011,"Snack is an adorable little restaurant. It is quite small, so you'll have to be comfortable being very close to your neighbor. We went for dinner. The menu is heavy Mediterranean. Â There weren't any sandwiches on the dinner menu. The service was good. There is a very small greek wine list and beer menu. I am not a huge fan of either. The food was good. They have great thick pita. The humous was spicy, which I wasn't expecting, but loved. We also had the spanakopita, also pretty good. We shared the chicken dish, which came with delicious green beans. The potatoes were a little bland. For desert we had the baklava. Very good. A little different than I've had I think there were cloves in it. Â  Overall, we enjoyed the meal.",1
989,0,5,12/8/2011,"Living near by, I come here all the time. The food is great, the staff are friendly and the atmosphere is very relaxed. Absolutely recommend it-- great for a date.",1
990,0,4,12/4/2011,"My friend and I stumbled in here purely by accident- but it was a happy accident! We were just looking for some lite bites and what a perfect find! We both had the classic Avgolemono soup, and although it was a bit on the salty side, it was fantastic. We also split the Roasted 1.0 sandwich, which was also very fresh and very good, and a generous size. It's such a cute, cozy atmosphere with a bit of 50's diner edge to it. Our waiter was great- so cute/friendly. I really enjoyed it here! I think I'll go out of my way to go back there again.",1
991,0,4,11/10/2011,"This place is so small, they have 5 tables inside and it's pretty cramped. We ordered: - Greek Iced Coffee: So good! Coffee lovers, you have to try this. - Some lemon soup? Very citrusy, but I love lemon, so I thought this was very refreshing. - Lamb Sandwich: Loved it, my friends ordered the Tuna Sandwich and the Chicken Sandwich, but I liked mine the most. The lamb was cooked and flavored well. Good place for a meal if you enjoy eating Mediterranean food.",1
992,0,4,10/28/2011,"I stumbled upon this cozy spot one shopping afternoon, weary with hunger. My actual thought @ the time was ""I need a snack,"" when I Â looked up & saw the sign. True story. The ONLY problem with shopping in SoHo is that there is a lack of affordable, tasty food choices. Snack is a welcomed spot. The 2nd thing that made me come in was that they have a ""people on yelp! love us"" sticker--& they definitely deserve it. The food is well proportioned, affordable, & delicious. It's not super cheap, lunch will run you a few dollars shy of $20, but it's more affordable than anything else in the neighborhood. I recommend the Lamb Sandwich--& I don't like lamb.",1
993,0,4,10/18/2011,"Snack is a solid pick! Â On a sunny Monday in mid-October, the restaurant was full of people. Â While the tables were occupied, the turn around was fairly quick. Â With a hospitable, friendly wait staff, I did not feel rushed. Â  I enjoyed the Greek Salad. Â Although modest and simple, the freshness was definitely apparent. Â  I will go back again -- from what I have heard, the savory pies are to die for.",1
994,0,4,9/27/2011,"What a wonderful Greek restaurant! Â We had to wait an hour to get a table, but it was worth it. Â They make every classic Greek favorite you could possibly be craving. Â Everything we ordered came out tasty, fresh, and delicious. Â We also enjoyed the cozy atmosphere and the super nice and accommodating staff. Â The waitress was honestly concerned about how long we had been waiting. Â She checked in with us and offered us a place at the bar to stand and drink while we waited for our table. Â They were just absolutely wonderful and the food was great! Â We will definitely be returning!",1
995,0,5,9/23/2011,"It may have been rainy outside, but Snack was cozy, toasty...and Greek! I arrived just-in-time to snag a warmly-lit window seat and avoided the dinner rush! Â  The super-friendly waitress kicked things off with a flight of savory spinach and cheese pies. Â For my main, the veal meatballs made fast friends with prunes and a red wine reduction. Â I washed it all down with a cup of honey-spiked tea. Â I'll definitely have to hit this mediterranean oasis again! (I'm curious about the iced, Greek coffee.)",1
996,0,4,9/18/2011,Exploring SOHO and after searching for what felt like an eternity for non street vendor food we stumbled on this gem. Saw all those great reviews on their store window so decided to go in. This small little resto impressed with big flavours and fresh ingredients. Ordered their lamb sandwich (so yummy) and chicken slovaki sandwich. I wish we had a place like that here in Toronto.,1
997,0,4,9/4/2011,"On a Friday night, my boyfriend, my roommate, and I were craving Greek, so we were excited to find Snack was so close to us. We got worried when we noticed that the whole restaurant was 4 or 5 tables, but luckily they were able to seat us right away. We ordered tzatziki to start, I got the avgolemono as my meal (wasn't too hungry), and both my roommate and boyfriend got the lamb stifado. The boyfriend had been eyeing the boneless lamb rib, but the server told him if he was hungry, it probably wouldn't be enough food. We also had baklava for dessert. The tzatziki was definitely five stars. Creamy, flavorful, and served with soft pita triangles fresh out of the oven. Even better, our waitress refilled our pita basket several times when we asked! The avgolemono was also really good and had lots of lemon to it, although I would have liked a bit more orzo and more than two bits of chicken in the whole bowl... Both my roommate and boyfriend loved the lamb stifado. The lamb was tender, perfectly seasoned, and the portion was generous. It also came with a delicious rice pilaf. The service was also very friendly, and you could tell our waitress knew the menu well. The only reason Snack doesn't get five stars is their baklava. While it was a pretty big portion, it was really dry. All in all, I'd definitely go back, but I don't think we'd get the baklava again.",1

999,0,4,8/1/2011,"Came here for dinner. They do not have the chicken potato butter bean salad for dinner, which I was craving, but the upside is I got to explore other parts of the menu. Like the gigantes bean salad. I could eat a double portion of that with some pita for dinner. The flavors here are fresh and delicious, and their pastitsio is like a favorite memory - beef and mac and cheese wrapped in cream and nutmeg and cinnamon. Upscale comfort food. I had the little shoe, which is like the vegetarian mousaka plus ground sirloin. I love this place - it churns out really heartwarming meals. I just wish it was slightly less expensive.",1

1002,0,4,6/17/2011,"Just got back to my desk, I can still taste the insane goodness that was the highly recommended lamb sandwich. I know, I should wait until the spell has worn off to review my lunch. I don't care, THE WORLD NEEDS TO KNOW. Get the lamb. Just do it. $16 for lunch for 2 people, we split the lamb sandwich (how many times can I say 'lamb' in this review?) and the tzatziki with pita. The sangwich was perfect. The aioli was unlike any other I've had, though I'll admit I don't eat enough Greek food. It had some bite, so the tzatziki was a perfect, cooling accompaniment. Don't have the same complaints about it being a tight space since we sat on one of the 3 benches outside to enjoy the day. I definitely think take-out is the way to do lunch here. lamb lamb lamb. (7, and those 3 count)",1
1003,0,3,6/12/2011,"Snack is a tiny restaurant tucked away in the village with a dim, casual, and cozy ambience serving authentic Greek food. It's more of a take out style Greek restaurant with table service. By night, candles appear on every table, and a separate menu for dinner is served that's not available during the day. The waitress had to pull out the table, also very tiny in order for me to sit on the inside without disturbing the table next to us. Even if you're a double zero you can't fit through the space in between the tables, which are only inches apart. There's no privacy, I heard everything loud and clear from left and right. Since it's such a small space, the waitress is constantly by your side and making sure if everything is all right. We enjoyed our meal with soda from Boylan (100% natural) and Greek fruit juice. Every dish has a nice blend of fresh ingredients. 1. Tzatziki - Greek yogurt dip with crunchy shreds of cucumber, served with warm pita. 2. Spinach Pie - More like a thin triangular hot pocket than an actual pie, flakey crust, and the right amount of filling. 3. Greek Salad - It's still a salad, not much to say. 4. Vegetarian Mousaka - Eggplants, mushrooms, potatoes with bÃ©chamel sauce, like a vegetarian lasagna. 5. Braised Lamb Stifado - Flavorful and tender lamb with tiny sweet onions comes with currant, apricot and almond pilaf (flavored rice).",1
1004,0,3,6/6/2011,"it is small and really cute place in SOHO. Clean and friendly service. I had the greek salad - it is over priced.

Â The veal meatballs, the lamb sandwich, the tasty Greek salad and the freshest tzadziki make me happy. Â I also love the lemon potatoes and have been known to cobble a meal out of those and the aforementioned tzadziki. Everything is quality and they have excellent Greek wines on the menu.",1
1006,0,5,5/26/2011,"I have a confession to make! While observing Pre Easter Lent I was dreaming about 2 things: steak from a grill and a lamb sandwich from Snack... Thats how good it is!!! Don't get me wrong, there is a wide variety of amazing items on their menu, it's just that particular sandwich really got my soft spot! My personal conspiracy theory is that they actually put some kind of a drug into it, like those Chinese ppl do, so you just HAVE to come back for more!!! The place itself is as small as it is cute. Perfect for a little get together with a long lost friend, but I would assume reservations are required for dinner hours... The staff is super cool, attentive and accommodating. Considering the fact that I am a very detail oriented person, I get so excited about eating there, that no matter how many times I go there ordering the same things, I always forget the name of their special Greek coffee, which apparently is a frapuccino and an iced one for that matter, haha. I wrote it down last time i was there and now they will finally have to stop making me that complimentary batch of my imaginary coffee. I think that $14 for lunch is pretty steep of a price, but I do believe it is worth it, thus I cannot take off not even a single star!!!",1

Our favorites were the veal kibbe/ meatballs (they melt in tour mouth) and roasted feta which was off the menu.

Will probably return soon...",1

Tips: Place gets crowded after 9 pm",1

This place made me think past feta cheese and gyros and opened up a world of delicate, delicious Greek delicacies. Portions are surprisingly big -- after just two appetizers I was forcing myself to finish my entree. The place is TINY, so get there early (even on a weeknight), because it fills up fast.",1
1011,0,3,4/3/2011,"Decent mediterranean place. The space is very small, but the dishes are fresh and the service is friendly. A little overpriced in my opinion, and I don't understand why there's an extra charge for pita, especially with soup or hummus... Beet salad is very fresh, but too large for being JUST a beet salad. Soups are also tasty and hearty, in particular the lentil soup, but a tad on the salty side.",1

1014,0,4,3/5/2011,"What a lovely little find! Super cutesy little precious jewelry box of a restaurant. I came here for lunch on my own and found it empty, save for one other patron. There are only about five or six tiny little tables, so I imagine it would be tough were it crowded, but it's the perfect spot to dine alone. I ordered the pastitsio without really knowing what it was and HOLY CRAP. It's a beefy, macaroni-y, bÃ©chamel-y pie of goodness in your belly. The server was sweet and chill and they serve Boylan's sodas. I will be back!",1

It's a small place with about 5 tables so get there early if there are more of 2 people in your party. We arrived around 9 so it was pretty busy but we hung out and had some drinks while we waited. The food is so fresh and delicious. We ordered a bunch of plates to share including the tzatziki (wow), lemon potatoes, herring (amazing), greek salad and greens. It was all completely delicious. The guys that work there are high on life which completes the dining experience as I really didn't want to leave. I will definitely be returning to this little wonder.",1

OCTOPUS was truly just bad -- shouldn't have eaten it but was hungry so gulped it down. Â They have no business serving it like that when the Greeks arguably do the best octopus preparation in the world. Â Don't get this dish if you go to SNACK. The Saganaki was fine. Nothing to write home to Athens about. The eggplant special (stuffed with ground sirloin and covered in bechamel) was tasty -- but overpriced. Lastly -- god bless the man Â -- but the waiter was KILLING ME with nonstop commentary and obsessive-compulsive chattiness about every single thing. Â He like didn't stop taking to my dater and I the entire meal - -which is cute at first, and then it becomes a hassle. Â Really dont mean to sound ornery but this guy really needs a lesson on how to serve people: friendly, yes; cloyingly attentive and pal-ly, no. id skip it.

Â I stopped in for quick snack around 5:30 Wednesday (12/29) to hold my date and I over before our late dinner reservation. The time is important because they stop selling sandwiches after 6 pm so luckily we just made it in time to try the Lamb Sandwich. Â I don't eat a lot of lamb or Greek food in general but I was blown away by the flavors and the balance of this sandwich. I really have no idea what was on the sandwich because the I couldn't quite read the small text on the chalkboard menu from my seat. Â I saw lamb and my date suggested we share it along with some hummus. Â I was famished so I really didn't take the time to look at what was on it either. Â I just know I enjoyed it. Small, hole in the wall of shop but great food and good service. Â Price wasn't bad either (for NYC). Â I think the sandwich and hummus was only around $14 or so for the two of us.

1024,0,2,9/25/2010,Lunch here is great. I always look forward to the lamb sandwich which is incredible. Unfortunately we just got back from dinner here and it was abysmal. Everyone raves about the eggplant dip and rightly so. It was the Â highlight of the meal. The octopus was absolutely disgusting. I knew we made a mistake the moment the plate was put in front of us. Totally unappetizing presentation and I truly almost gagged as I bit into it. It tasted and smelled like cat food. I love octopus. This was an abomination. We left and grabbed some ice cream around the corner just to get rid of the taste in our mouths. Seriously what are they thinking with that dish??,1

1026,0,2,8/15/2010,"The best dishes here merit four stars, but the food is uneven. The roast chicken entree I had was terrible. Even the dark meat was dry. The breast was so dry that it took two glasses of water to get it down. I know it's only one dish, but plain chicken is really a good test of a kitchen's quality. It's easy to make a bad one because you don't have anything to hide behind -- and this kitchen failed on it. The prices are indeed low by the standards of quality restaurants in NYC, but they achieve those prices by skimping on expensive ingredients like meat and substituting large quantities of rice, potatoes and other starches to fill you up. If you like starches more than meat -- like most of the women I eat with -- that will be fine with you and you'll happily pocket the savings. If you're a meat lover, it's false economy.",1

Snack is a smallish restaurant that's a bit too big for it's breeches. Â If you don't live or work in the neighborhood, or get lazy after work and order expensive takeout as a last resort (me), I'm not sure why you should go out of your way to have weekend brunch or dinner here, although I can see how it draws a lunchtime work crowd for sandwiches. Â  Speaking of going out of your way, I LOVE, nay CRAVE lemon chicken soup (which is always part of my Snack repertoire when I do order here), but if I were a billionaire living on a remote island in the Caribbean, I'd have my soup flown in from Mykonos in Miami and not Snack (remember, I'm a pretend billionaire so I'm not being a cheapo on jet fuel). Same thing with the lamb meatballs, beet salad, and the roasted chicken, I can immediately think of better restaurants in New York to order those dishes from. Â  Since I'm not a billionaire or even a millionaire, I will continue to spend my hard earned money elsewhere until the lemon chicken soup craving turns me into a monster and I have to feed.",1

Â I was told the place was tiny (the entire place can only seat 10 people comfortably) and that we should just order the sandwiches to go. Â Fortunately when we arrived, there was one open table and nobody waiting so we promptly sat down. The menu has many healthy options and you will not feel guilty about what you ate afterwards. Â We started off with the eggplant dip and I had the lamb sandwich while my friend had the tuna sandwich. Â The eggplant dip was a very normal affair and did not stand out too much. Â My friend enjoyed her tuna sandwich even though she did note the tuna was a little dry. Â If it was just based on those two items, I would most likely given the place 3 stars, but the lamb sandwich was so amazing that it bumps it up to four. Â I do not know how long they stewed the lamb, but it was so tender. Â It was complimented with a sweet and savory tomato aioli and served on light and fluffy ciabatta bread.

Â My chicken sandwich was pretty kick ass, considering I do not like hard, cold bread. Â (actually, minus the bread, I'm going to ask for pita next time)... My co-worker got a beet salad and a spinach pie. Â Both phenomenal choices. Â I love Mediterranean food with all of its thick hearty sauces, olives and olive oil. Â YUMMY. Â Needless to say, I think its sister restaurant ""Snack Taverna"" will be just as spectacular. Â I am ready for a good meal anytime. Â  Forewarning, it's so TINY, it's unforgettable.

I also got the Classic Greek Avgolemon, which was my first time for this traditional dish. And any soup afterwards will be forever compared to this one. Jennifer S. said that it was missing the chicken, but even so, it was a very flavorful dish. Jennifer got a special of the day lamb dish, which was uniquely flavored but, in my opinion, a bit expensive for the quantity. I did appreciate that although there are very few tables, we were not rushed out of the restaurant.

Ok back to my soup. SERIOUSLY, why have I not tried this before? There is so much more to typical Greek food than the ""Greek Salad"", Grape Leaves and Chicken.

About 1/3 of the time I go, I'm so hungry that I end up getting my food to go and sitting on the bench outside or near the playground. The other reason I took away 1 star is because they keep using this blond waitress that was hired last summer or spring. She's the worst. The first time I noticed her, she got my order wrong and insisted that I had ordered what she thought I did, even though I order the same couple of items and what she insisted I ordered was not one of them. Then when our food finally came, she kept coming by and trying to take away the plates even though food was still on them and my friend was still eating. The table next to us also kept saying they weren't done with their food when she tried to take away their food. She forgets orders frequently and I'm just confused about why they keep her on if she can't do her job correctly even though she's only overseeing 4 two-seat tables and 1 three-seater.",1
1052,0,4,12/29/2009,"Oh my gosh. I went here with a good friend during a lady date; neither of us had ever been before. There are only about 4-5 tables (seriously), so we had to wait, but sweet Jesus...that lamb sandwich. I would wait a year for that beauty. So tender and flavorful, on bread so fresh! It was a dream come true for my mouth. Topped off with a mint lemonade (one of my favorite things) and it made for an absolutely fantastic and memorable lunch. I'll be back for sure :)",1
1053,0,4,12/10/2009,"Snack is a tiny restaurant with lots of flavor! Â  I went for dinner - which apparently has a different menu than lunch - and ordered the fava as an appetizer and the boneless lamb for my entree. Â Yum and Yum! Â When I first get my meal, I thought that I wouldn't be full by the end, but I am still stuffed! Â I suppose it helps that I ate the fava with pita bread (which was warm and chewy). Â I also tasted my friend's classic Greek soup - also terrific and very authentic. Â I had a Greek roommate my first two years in NY and I swear this was just as good as his homemade ""Greek Penicillin"" (basically chicken broth with egg, lemon, fresh ground pepper, and orzo). Â  The service was fine, nothing really special. Â But I was impressed that even though my and I had one of the four coveted tables, they never rushed us out for one of the couples waiting to be seated. I will have to go back for lunch and try the lamb sandwich that everyone seems to rave about on this lovely site we call Yelp.",1
1054,0,4,11/29/2009,"I went here because sincerely, I've spent too much during my nights out and I need to start saving for my year-end trips... hence, logically focusing more on the cheap eats. (and obviously going out on fewer dates) I went to this place expecting average food and I'm glad I was really wrong about this place. There is nothing average about the lamp sandwich. It is simply amazing.... I had a mint lime juice which was OK. I thought the mint was going to be crushed or something but all the mint i got was a leaf in the drink. Staff was really nice and quick, the sandwich came out in like 4 minutes. My friend had a chicken sandwich which was really good too. The only thing that bothered me is that the appetizers were a bit overpriced in my opinion. Beware: this place has only greco-turkish style coffee, something relatively hard to find in the city. Its a hit or miss depending on the individual tastes of people. I love that kind of coffee. Reminds me of the time I used to roam the deserts of Northern Africa.",1
1055,0,5,10/30/2009,"A friend who used to live in NY gave us a three page list of her favorite restaurants to try in NY, but she said that if she had to pick just one place to endorse, Snack would be it. We trusted her judgement and had a delightful dinner in this tiny little SoHo spot. We are lucky to have gotten in - we walked in on a Sunday evening, about 20 minutes before the kitchen closed and they were able to accomodate our group of 4. There were several parties that walked in afterwards that all got turned away since there was no more seating and the kitchen was closing. I had the lamb stew which was so tender and flavorful, the BF raved about the mousaka. Our server was absolutely delightful and attentive and enhanced an already fabulous meal. I would definitely come back here again on my next trip to NYC and just make sure I'm here early enough to guarantee a spot at one of their 6 tiny tables.",1
1056,0,5,9/29/2009,"Thanks to my little Yelp friends, I knew to pop in here after a day of shopping around SoHo. Great find! On a Sunday night, we were the only ones in there and had the waitress' attention all to ourselves. This paid off because during our wine selection process, she let us taste every white wine on the list, plus gave us her personal wine commentary. Surprise surprise, we picked her favorite wine. The pastitio kicked ass - evenly balanced sweet and savory. Lamb rib appetizer was flavorful but could have been a tad bit more tender. It was clear that this was a 'regulars' spot. After a while, one or two more people strolled in, pulled up a chair, busted out a book, and the waitress brought them their standard order. It's rare to find such a local gem in the vast bustling city but I'm glad I did. Well worth every moment!",1
1057,0,2,9/26/2009,"Hmm. So far, I am not impressed. Stopped by to grab a sandwich for take out. Woman behind the counter clearly wished me to hurry up and make a decision. I placed my order and she gave me the total: $8.15. I wanted to give her exactly that amount but she would not take my five pennies to make up the five cents in 15 cents. ""Oh, no pennies. He doesn't like pennies."" (Who is ""he""? Am I supposed to know?) And who doesn't accept pennies? Aren't pennies money? So you'll take my dime but not my pennies? Wtf? I gave her a quarter instead, and of course I got back a dime. Just what I need: more change. She told me to sit outside and that my sandwich would be brought to me when ready. Fine, as there were no seats inside anyway. Sat outside on the bench. Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock. 15 minutes go by, and I""m wondering seriously how long it takes to make a bloody sandwich. So I go inside to ask about it. Turns out my sandwich has been sitting on the counter this whole time. The girl (a different one now) behind the counter says, ""Oh, is this yours?"" Â  What, do employees not talk to one another in this place? I mean, I could sit all day on the bench outside and watch the yuppie families pile their DKNY-sporting toddlers into their luxury SUVs, but I think I ordered a sandwich because I'm hungry! The sandwich, as it turned out, was really good. Lovely ciabatta bread, fresh ingredients (I ordered the marinated sandwich), and all-in-all delightful. But when Alidoro is only half a block away, I think I'll give Snack place a miss next time.",1

1059,0,4,8/26/2009,"Small and cozy. Agreed that customer service could be better. Anyways, best way to avoid them is just grab to go and eat at the park on Thompson and Spring. My favorite of what I had so far is the lamb sandwich. A good 8"" long, floury ciabatta holds a generous portion of well flavored braised lamb, sweet onions, and arugula. Tuna sandwhich is pretty good too. Hard-braised yellowfin tuna with artichokes, tomatoes, cucumbers, portobello mushrooms, scallions and shaved viahotiri cheese in a lemon vinaigrette on ciabatta bread.",1

1061,0,2,8/14/2009,"INCREDIBLY rude. So rude you know they are TRYING to be rude. I place a large phone order for our office, well over $100 worth of food, and the entire time on the phone the guy was as rude as possible. The culmination of the rudeness was so surprising that I'm not even angry, I'm just shocked: After ordering 6 entrees already, I said: Oh I'm sorry I don't know how to pronounce the word for the cheese triangles, how do you say that? GUY: Cheese. Triangles. There are no words. That kind of rudeness is purposeful! That said, the food was good, although the portions were TINY, especially in comparison to the price. Everything we ordered said it came with pita, but we ordered 10 entrees and received ONE PITA cut up into 10 pieces. No joke. They sent these covered almond dessert things in the bag and I kept trying to figure out how they can be skimpy with PITA, which is so cheap, but then give us a handful of almond for no reason? I'm sure the almond things were more expensive than the pita . . .",1

1070,0,4,6/17/2009,"After perusing great lunch options within the SOHO area I found this gem. Â Since I'm a fan of lamb (more lamb!!), I was intrigued by the lamb sandwhich (officially, the lamb 1.3, I believe). Â  Lamb 1.3 was great. Now as for the service coordination, while not poor, was a tad odd. Â Because the place is so small (very few tables, that's fine), I asked for my sandwhich to be bagged up as 'to go' (naturally, since I had to sit outside, fine with that), however, I really wanted to have a beer with the sandwhich; couldn't do that, so I just ordered and waited for food to be bagged up. Â While waiting, two tables cleared (and were never re-seated during my entire stay) and I asked if I could be seated at the table, because a) I would prefer to eat inside and b) I would like to order a beer. Â To which I received this puzzling response (paraphrasing): 'I'm sorry, you can't have the table since they are already bagging your food"". Â Hmmm...so, I was willing to spend more money, but it was like the $10 minimum clock had been reset (which there is, definitely understand why with such a small place). Â So, I ate on the bench, original order, tables not filled and a further revenue stream from a customer stopped in it's tracks. Â Oh well! Also, signs post for $20 minimum for credit card orders (personally, that should align with the $10 minimum for being seated inside). Â Just a heads-up. I would definitely recommend.",1
1071,0,4,6/12/2009,Came here for lunch and -- like many others -- went with the lamb sandwich. I've got to say I agree with everyone else. It's really good.,1

The interior of the restaurant itself is absolutely tiny, so if you can't find a seat and the weather permits, by all means take your sandwich (or other bench-appropriate meal) outside to eat on one of the benches outside.",1
1074,0,4,5/3/2009,"I've been wanting to try this place for ages--but wasn't hungry enough, wasn't able to score one of the few tables, etc. Finally made it in tonight, and was duly impressed. Prices seem high ($6 for a dip with one pita, $11-$15 for appetizers, $18-$20 for entrees), but portions are huuuge. Two of us split the ""Pikilia"" (a Â mixed mezze platter) and the stuffed eggplant special. The Pikilia consists of four dips, four stuffed grape leaves, olive and lemon garnish, which comes with two fresh pitas ($15; $1 each for extra pitas). The roasted eggplant one was great--the carp roe one was a bit salty though. The stuffed eggplant dish ($19) was delicious--the eggplant was sweet and tender, and the ground beef filling was perfect. It came with a side of rice and lentils as well as a small plate of greens ($6 if you buy it on its own). Service was friendly; water refills were frequent. Alas, I was completely stuffed and had no room for dessert ($4 each). The meal was remotely ruined by a table of drunken douchebags, and since the place is small, it turned into a bit of an ordeal. Â  I'll be back though, if I can manage to get a table again! Tip: There's take out and delivery here if you don't want to deal with the wait ($10 minimum for the latter).",1
1075,0,5,4/27/2009,"Wow. Â Two words. Â Lamb Sandwich. Â Succulent, tender, & bursting with flavor. Â The mint lemonade on a hot spring day hit the spot. Â  I can't wait to go again to try everything else on the menu.",1

1078,0,4,4/7/2009,"I had the pleasure of placing a large corporate lunch order from Snack the other day. Â The acting manager was extremely helpful, providing recommendations on how much to order for the group and promising to have our meal arrive by 1:30 pm. Â Even though the deliveryman got a bit lost within our building, he still managed to arrive at 1:30 pm on the dot. Â I could not have been happier with the service. Â  The food, itself, was just as impressive. Â  I ordered one of the combination platters to start, choosing the Carp Roe, Roasted Eggplant, and Hummus dips. Â The carp roe spread had a fresh, fishy flavor. Â The eggplant was uniquely smoked and provided a positive grilled after-taste. Â The hummus was some of the creamiest I had ever tasted. Â However, while I enjoyed the silky texture, I would have preferred a bit more flavor from the spread. Â  The accompanying pitas were comfortingly soft and warm. Â The Greek Salad was crisp and fresh, but a bit over-dressed. Â  However, the team was blown away by the tasty Artichoke Chicken Salad, which actually included little lettuce. Â The lack of roughage was compensated for by large hunks of tender chicken, potatoes, butter beans, tomatoes, and string beans. Â This earthy combination was tossed in a savory black olive vinaigrette. Â I also helped myself to a slice of the delicate Spinach Pie. Â The moist phillo dough melted in my mouth, leaving the bold spinach and gooey cheese filling to gratify my taste buds. Â The hearty pie satisfied without being too dense. Â It was also served with our choice of cold appetizer or side Greek salad. Â To top off my order, I purchased a variety of sandwiches, all of which were quite large and priced between $7.50 and $9.50. Â I tried half of the Marinated 1.0 and fell in love with the lemony mix of artichokes, tomatoes, cucumbers, portobello mushrooms, scallions and shaved cheese. Â The Mediterranean ingredients were stuffed into a large, crisp ciabatta roll. Â  This tasty meal solicited cheers from my colleagues...another order well placed by the resident foodie :) Â As I predicted in my conversation with Snack's manager, we will be ordering from this tasty Greek cafe again!",1

The lamb sandwich was DELISH, all the flavors went together very well. I couldn't decide to get the spinach pie or the chicken boureki. Ended up with spinach, i guess that just means I have to go back AGAIN to try the chicken =P Love love this place...but the ppl who work there are kinda of not very friendly...but it's new york...not california...so oh well.

1082,0,3,2/19/2009,"Was compelled to update my review after dinner last night. I went to snack at around 8:30 - 9:00 pm to get takeout on my way home from work. Previously I think I went on the early side and they charged me lunch prices. In my old review I said: ""Vegetarian Moussaka to die for. $14 and change after tax is a little pricey for every night."" WELL... if it's dinnertime, the vegetarian moussaka is $19.50 including tax. Variable pricing annoys me, especially when it is exactly the same dish. Just because eggplant is a nightshade vegetable, doesn't justify charging more for it after dark. It's still great food BUT the value is just not there at almost $20. Service with a smile wasn't included in that price either. If snack standardized pricing on entrees and suggested that their staff be friendly to people giving them money, I'd gladly go back. For now there are better options in my neighborhood.",1

I was happy to see that it hadn't changed one bit. It was still as delicious as ever, when I went a few weeks ago for a casual lunch with a friend. The ingredients are as fresh as ever, and the portion sizes are great for what you get. I love moussaka as a rule, and they do it well. Also love the keftedes and stuffed grape leaves. Sandwiches are good, too! I love Snack! Eat here!",1
1101,0,3,7/16/2008,"Very cute and romantic- made the mistake of coming with a friend. Seems like a place that should be for dates only. They were out of a lot of things I would have liked to have. The skordalia was good but tiny for the price. The veal meatballs were excellent and filling. I bet the sandwiches are good, but they weren't available for dinner (I don't think... ) Bathroom situation is really odd... you have to leave the place and walk down a hall.",1
1102,0,5,7/12/2008,"After an iPhone ordeal, my girlfriend and I felt the need to treat ourselves to something small, tasty, elegant, filling and fun. Â This was definitely what we found. Â Though it's small, the food is amazing and the service is professional but laid back. Â Our server made fun of the beer names and casually joked with us. Â We sampled the to-die-for soup with a couple of beers, she had the shrimp and I the chicken (though I envied the couples around us with tons of amazing apps and snacks to share) which was more than filling and well worth the $18 each. Â We finished it off with the best baklava I have ever tasted. Though the size, space, signage and servers are modest, this place will overwhelm your taste buds and help you feel down-to-earth rich. Â  NO LONGER cash only, $20 minimum on major cards.",1
1103,0,5,7/9/2008,"Authentic! My Father is as Greek as they come. This place mirrors his ingredients and yummy flavor combinations. When I eat the Greek Salad (Cucumber, Feta, Onion, Tomato, Olive Oil, Oregeno, Etc) I am transported to my backyard as a kid - eating summer dinner with the family. It is very tiny & Cash Only. I find it easy to go here right after work to get a table w/ friends. You will not be dissapointed. I would go as far to say best Greek food in Manhattan.",1
1104,0,4,6/24/2008,"Ideal for ordering out, Snack offers delicious, um, I-cant-spell-it-lemony-chicken-with-little-pasta soup as well as quality tzaziki and hummus. Â Recommend sharing the cold aps with a friend, though, as they give you quite a lot. Â Not pricey but not cheap - still, a solid choice for a tasty work-day snack.",1
1105,0,3,5/5/2008,"My boyfriend and I went to Snack for Lunch today. The waitress seemed really stressed waiting the 5 tables that were inside and so the service was a bit slow. I had a cherry juice and he had a frappe- both good, though I'd recommend the latter. Each entree came with a ""mezze"" or appetizer. We ended up with a pie off the specials which was wonderful, stuffed tomatoes and peppers (good, light, a bit bland), feta salad, and tzatziki (best i've had in a while). Pita is an extra dollar. Overall it was a tiny bit expensive and slow but fun, as you have a nice view of the street.",1
1106,0,5,4/30/2008,"Snack is one of the places I miss most about previous days I lived in NY...you just can't find vegetarian souvlaki like this in Denver. I make a point to stop here every time I get back to visit. It is great for take out lunch, although a little small for dinner (even by NY standards)",1
1107,0,3,4/29/2008,"Pros: Â The food is actually very good Cons: Â Someone who doesn't drink wine or any alcohol for that matter must have picked the wines on that list... I don't see how it could be any other way. Â We ordered a bottle of white and I swear it tasted like someone poured out half the bottle and refilled it with Milwaukee's Best or Natty Lite. Â Also, the service was not very good or pleasant, which is very strange considering you can't possibly fit more than 15 people in the entire restaurant.",1
1108,0,4,4/7/2008,"Cool place for a quick bite to eat Â ($$ - decently cheap) if they have space (they only have like 5 super small tables in a row). I got the chicken and potatoes special which was excellent. Their hummus was okay, but not great. The place is small so don't expect to have a private lunch here... Definitely a perfect spot for a little shopping sustenance.",1
1109,0,4,4/4/2008,"this place is tiny so getting seat can be a feat. Â if you are lucky, get some mint lemonade. Â it's nice. Â i got the portobello and roasted red peppers sammy on cibatta. Â it was good, but drippy. Â  it did the i'm taking a bite the contents are squishy out. Â i still enjoyed it despite the falling apart bit. Â felt like the waitress was rushing us out, but could understand with people waiting to eat. Â would definitely go back to try the combo platter. Â choose 3 items and pita galore.",1
1110,0,5,3/13/2008,"I was visiting NY and I told my friend to pick a place that she'd never been, Â and lucky for me, she chose Snack. There are only about five tables in the entire restaurant - I actually couldn't believe we got a table without a reservation, but it all worked out. My friend is Greek, Â and grew up eating Greek foods, so she ordered our food. We had the most amazing cheese triangles and the eggplant spread - both amazing. We also shared the lamb dish which was fantastic. Overall a perfect experience, and as an added bonus is was very inexpensive.",1
1111,0,5,3/8/2008,"Ok, I admit it. Â I've never been a huge fan of Greek food. Â I'm reminded of this place in Minneapolis, It's Greek to Me -- and eating this really, really REALLY tough octopus appetizer there. Â I don't remember any other dishes there, though I ate their several times in high school in an attempt to be cool by going ""downtown"" or Uptown (yes, as in the Prince song too). Snack changed my mind. Creamy cucumber tsatsiki. Savory veal meatballs, bespeckled in pinenuts. Flaky spinach pies (how do you spell that?!). Oooooooh yeeeeeaaaah. We really liked the prices, portions and ambiance too.",1
1112,0,4,3/5/2008,"Ducked into this extremely small space (a tiny storefront on Thompson) on a rainy Tuesday afternoon and scored the last table (out of maybe 5 or 6) and had a very filling, very good lunch. The highlight was the butter bean salad ($8), a generous helping of large butter beans over a bed of arugula and topped with a lemon vinagrette. The well-reviewed lamb sandwich ($9) was HUGE (you can split this), but was as good as promised. Eyeing the other tables, the dips and wraps also looked delicious. The only downside was that at 3pm they were out of the tuna sandwich and the spanikopita. But that's what Â really what we risked with having late lunch. Otherwise, Â what we had was excellent.",1
1113,0,4,3/1/2008,"I actually missed this place even after I read another Yelp review warning me I would miss it and resolved not to! This dark slice of a restaurant has no bold lettering or color to catch you but doubletrack, search and hunt until you find it because the experience is WONDERFUL. First of all, you are really squeezed with exactly 8 other people, if you only came with one person. And I recommend you come with either 1 or 3 people, exactly. But I liked being squeezed because I am outgoing by nature and the snatches of conversation I overheard were hilarious. Anyway, my friend and I split the lamb sandwich (as feverishly upheld by other Yelpers) and baklava. The lamb was incredibly soft, juicy and flavorful while the bread was the perfect foil: dense, sturdy and crusty. The baklava was comparable to other baklavas I've had. I would say Kashkaval's is crispier and more held together. However, as I glanced around the table, I compiled a list of what to order next time, with a group of 3: Meze such as hummus, tsaztiki, white beans gigantes, any of the soups (they looked divine), and the lamb sandwich. I can't wait until then!",1
1114,0,4,1/25/2008,"Literally a hole in the wall, but delicious food. Try the veggie moussaka, the hummus...really, anything. Probably have a better chance of getting food if you do takeout instead of trying to get a seat, as I doubt that it has more than 10 chairs, but it's worth the wait.",1
1115,0,5,12/7/2007,"One of my supervisors recommended this place to me. I walked passed the place twice (very unassuming, small door). Once inside, I was surprised to discover that the space underneath my bed was bigger than this establishment. Good thing I was just picking up my order. So I got the greek salad with the chicken bourlaki (doubt I spelled that correctly). Whoa, this stuff tastes great. Probably the best greek salad I've had to date. And the lamb sandwich is M-azing. Definitely a diamond in the ruff... Tip: If you must eat-in, ask someone if it's ok to sit on their lap. Otherwise, plan on eating on the benches outside.",1
1116,0,5,12/4/2007,"perfect lunch spot when you want something light and fresh and pretty. Â I had the artichoke chicken salad and it had beans in it the size of my brain. Â Have you ever had a mouth full of bean? Â It's fantastic! Â The bigger then bean, the better. Â  I'm totally coming here for dinner one night after work for sure.",1
1117,0,5,11/18/2007,my big fat greek lamb sandwich. took my visiting cousin from chicago here after she had done time at some of ny's fancier establishments and was in the market for some real food.. Â  Â  braised lamb that falls apart. Â  ciabatta-esque bread. Â  arugala. Â  get it.,1
1118,0,4,11/6/2007,"I gotta say, I was very impressed with Snack. Â How did I not know of this place sooner? Â Oh wait...I know. Â 'Cause it blends into Thompson St. so well that unless you know where it is, you can easily walk right by it! Â Spurred by Sam and Russ's reviews, I decided to spice up my lunch routine and grab a takeaway from Snack. Â Quick service, small location, GREAT food. Â I tried the Lamb sandwich which was not only wonderfully flavored and smelled so delicious that I had to prevent myself from just stopping in the middle of Prince St. and start my chomping. Â The only complaint one might have would be that the bread gets quite soggy 'cause of all the lamb juice drippings. Â But hey! Â I'm not complaining!",1
1119,0,5,10/16/2007,"Yogurt place ll - not Snack also on ....71 Sullivan Street (between Prince St & Spring St), New York, NY 10012 Why is this place so cute? I never knew yogurt could be so this good. Located in Soho this little Greek boutique is hidden way on 71 Sullivan street btw Prince and Spring. This little shop is full of all thing Greek, from cookies, baklava, spinach & cheese pies and of course homemade Greek yogurt. Originally form East Elmhurst Queens they have branched out to Manhattan severing locals and tourist alike. I got a cup of creamy rich 2% cows milk yogurt for $2.50 that was accompanied with apricot syrup and slivered almonds but one has choices with a verity of syrups and toppings. Also with my little afternoon snack I got couple of almond cookies for $.50 (each), apricot cookie $1 (each) and a spinach & cheese pie for $2.50. All perfect for making your rounds on a nice cool fall afternoon. RANTS & RAVES: All is homemade goodies, not really full meals however the yogurt with granola would make a great breakfast that is full and healthy.",1
1120,0,3,10/11/2007,"Yummy. I much prefer dinner to lunch. I've ordered take-out for lunch a few times and every single experience was sour. For some reason, the lunch crew is just not as friendly. Plus, the dinner menu is way better. Think it's worth mentioning that there are about 12 seats at this restaurant so prepared to wait if you go during a popular dining time. All in all, it's a cute little place for a relaxed bite that isn't fussy.",1
1121,0,5,9/25/2007,"So yeah, you all know the fighting over the lunch place story. Â Clearly great Yelp minds think alike. Â  The owners of this place and Snack Taverna on Bedford have the modern Greek cuisine down pat! Â The lamb sandwich is epic and divine, the atmosphere is adorable, the service was fantastic, and the mint lemonade was expertly crafted (you'd think Mint + Lemonade + Sugar would be an easy concoction - not so, and these guys do it perfectly) Basically you can't go wrong. Â Can get crowded (there's only like 5 tables) but get it to go and watch others drool over your lunch. Â One of the best sandwiches I've had in a while.",1
1122,0,4,9/24/2007,"After a lengthy debate with my local hosts about where to dine for lunch, after ruling out a relatively local place known for it's Mediterranean style food and especially its lemon chicken orzo soup, it was settled that we'd go to a different spot because it had rockin' sandwiches. Along for the ride, I said, hey, why not? Â You're the boss. Â (A figure of speech. Â Literally.) So, imagine my confusion when we sit down and the first thing I see is a bunch of lamb entrees and a lemon chicken orzo soup. Â WTF?! Â I'm so confused. Well, it just so happens that this place Snack is an annex of some sort to the other place we were considering, even though no one knew it when we were debating. Â What are the odds? Â I mean, I'm in the biggest eating city in the world, and my two compatriots are essentially debating the merits of the same place??? The lamb sandwich was amazing. Â What is it about lamb in NYC right now? Â Two times in like 14 hours. Â And the soup was very refreshing and flavorful. This is a super cute little spot with seating for no more than about 15 people, so be prepared to wait if you're there during prime time. Oh, and the minty fresh lemonade hit the spot on this warm day, too. (OK, so Russ already told the story, but I like my version better. Ha.)",1
1123,0,4,9/18/2007,"I went here for lunch the other day with a coworker and it was great. Â I had the chicken sandwich (chicken, tomatoes, roasted red onions, spicy mint lemonaise, arugula and mint), which may be the best damn chicken sandwich I've had. Â My coworker seemed very pleased with his Greek salad/meat pie-ish thing. Â The items on the menu largely consist of your more popular Greek choices (spanakopita, pastitsio, etc.) and are all very reasonably priced. Â It's a very small place (maybe about 10 seats) and while it wasn't crowded when we got there, it was definitely getting there when we left. Â I can understand why.",1
1124,0,5,9/14/2007,"I lived on spring street for 3 years, basically around the corner from Snack. In that time I developed a strong addiction to snack's chicken sandwich on the lunch menu (among other menu items, but the chicken sandwich was my fave). I was getting snack delivery at least once a week and the delivery guy and I became very close (kidding). Anyways, what I am getting at is that I like this place. You should go.",1
1125,0,5,5/16/2007,"I squeezed into this place seeking something healthy and hearty for lunch. Â I noticed a ""specials"" chalkboard with chicken and roasted vegetable salad scribbled on it and decided to give it a shot. I sat on the benches outside and waited. Â After a little while I was presented with a little white box that I couldn't wait to open once I got back to the office. .....Wow! A moist chicken breast section, surrounded by roasted tomatoes, eggplant, bell peppers, onions and mushrooms with lettuce and baby mixed greens accompanied by two delicious and large feta croutons and great dressing. Â  The best salad I've had recently. Â I definitely will be paying them another visit.",1
1126,0,4,5/9/2007,"Ever since I studied in Greece, I have always looked for a decent Greek place no matter where I happen to be traveling. Now that I live in NYC, I had been pretty disappointed in terms of finding a quick, tasty and legitimate Greek menu. Sure, you could go to Thalassa or the like to have a real sit-down meal, but what about the quick occasions that you need something hearty and fast? Greek usually perfectly fits the bill, but I hadn't had much luck in the city until this place. Cozy little space with a very legit Greek menu, with all the favorites: moussaka, souvlaki, spanikopita, baklava and even a couple of Greek beers (though no Mythos, my hands-down favorite). Went there 2 days in a row after I discovered it, and been pleased both times. I particularly recommend the garlic potato puree with pita and the warm chicken pie with mushrooms for lunch, and the deliciious eggplant stuffed with ground sirloin and bechemel sauce for dinner, though it is a special. The baklava serving size is HUGE and it is really very good, certainly comparable with some of the best homecooked stuff I've had. All in all, very dependable and authentic Greek cooking, reasonable prices, good service and good atmosphere. Certainly worth checking out, whether you need a quick snack while wandering SoHo or want to come out for a casual but romantic dinner.",1
1127,0,4,3/7/2007,"i've only tried the sandwiches here, and the hummus (mmmm). everything tastes fresh, light but filling, and actually healthy! the sandwich bread is a bit crunchy and not as soft as most breads but it doesnt leave that soft bread gunk stuck in your teeth feeling, which i hated back when i wore braces. minus one star because there are only 5 two-seater tables so most of the times i came here, they were already taken. Â a perfect cozy place for you to go alone as well. i love coming here in the beginning of summer. it's a great stop on a shopping excursion in soho.",1
1128,0,5,1/30/2007,"I live for this place. Â It feeds me lunch at least twice a week, and never once has it let me down. Â A few highlights: the lamb sandwich; the artichoke/chicken salad; any variation of the pikilia (three cold mezes). Â Everything is fresh, staff are friendly, and the food is without rival. Â These kinds of places make food in New York the best!",1
1129,0,5,1/24/2007,"I Snack on a weekly basis and it's always the same: spinach pie with a side of eggplant mush. Then a squidgen of lemon followed by a ""don't bother me, I'm eating"". Round off the experience with a handful of jordan almonds. Truly one of the best meals in soho.",1
1130,0,5,8/14/2006,"Snack is the happy tasty, the warm and wonderful, a delicious restaurant with lots of vegetarian options. Less abstractly, it's a tiny, tin-ceilinged, ten-seater Greek restaurant, Â with a great menu of mezze -- think of it less as a gyro stand, and more as an upscale but homey small plates restaurant. I wish I remembered the names of the dishes better, but there was a cheese and tomato salad that was wonderful; a white bean spread that was savory and delicious, and stuffed peppers as well. It's great for lunch while shopping, but would also be good for a date... though you'd run the risk of your date falling in love with the Baklava.",1
1131,0,5,9/21/2005,"Their spinach triangles cannot be beat. The Greek salad is also wonderful. If it's hot out, don't miss the mint lemonade. On a sunny day, have the folks at Snack pack your lunch to go and sit at one of the tables in the nearby park. UPDATE 1/2007: Don't miss the pastitsio!",1
1132,0,4,4/21/2005,"Cozy little Greek place. Â Love the meze! Â Highly recommend the skordalia (potato garlic puree) and the tzatziki (cucumber yogurt dip).

To cap off this wonderful experience, the pizza was non descript and Â the pasta tasted like it had been ordered from a diner. So poor, in fact, that my two kids, who normally love pasta, refused to eat theirs. Won't be back and will definitely not recommend this place to anyone.",-1
1134,1,1,11/25/2013,Got a margarita pizza. First off let me say very expensive that one pie came out to 25$ with 2 simple toppings on it. Secondly the was a piece of hair in it.

This was our first time ordering from Peppino's and we will never eat their food again. Overpriced for the quality. I gave one star for prompt delivery and one star because the food wasn't horrible. It was just bad. Their bread is tasteless- this goes for their crust and garlic crisps. No flavor whatsoever. Same with the plain pizza. We couldn't even finish a slice. The marina sauce is coated with a layer of oil and tastes burnt. The penne a'la vodka was fine, but again, lacked flavor. The eggplant parm roll tasted old. If you want good pizza on 5th Ave go to Brooklyn Central or La Villa, which also has amazing pasta and appetizers.",-1

1140,1,3,12/5/2009,"Peppinos is far superior to your typical neighborhood slice shop but it isn't a destination pizza place. The staff is friendly to a fault, which almost makes up for the errors in their food. 2 out of the last 3 times that I've ordered pies from them, they have put the wrong toppings on the pies. I'm not a picky guy but it is annoying when you are paying $20 + for a pizza. I'm not sure what the issue is but I hope they get it fixed. Delivery service is inconsistent in delivery time (15-45 minutes) but the food does arrive hot every time.

Â Pricing is excellent for the amount of food that is served! Â If I could give a 10 star rating they would get it for sure. Â On another note we were at the restaurant when that musician came into the restaurant. Â What an unprofessional jerk! Â Yes the manager was trying to find out what was going on in the middle of dinner service making tons of calls and trying not to let it affect the patrons.

Â A little too good, like, ""I'm already really full, but I should probably have just one more slice,"" good. Â A large isn't a ""huge"" pie, but with how good it is take that as a saving grace! Â I definitely recommend :)",-1
1163,1,5,1/14/2012,"This place is pretty close to perfect. Â Amazing brick oven, wood fired pizza, incredible heros made with homemade, amazing dough. Â Sauce is fresh, barely touched using great products. Â Incredibly warm and nice staff both in person and on the phone. Â This isn't a complaint but a request.... I wish they had a few more appetizer choices, i think they could do a really good fried mozzarella app, fried calamari, maybe an arancine? I also wish they would make a clam pizza which when done well by great pizza restaurants is absolutely amazing. Â  I just feel like they would do everything well and this would be great. Â Keep it up Peppinos, you guys are great in every way.",-1
1164,1,5,8/31/2011,"Okay, here It is. Went to Grimaldi's and the line was way too long. Yelped a few places and found reviews for Â Peppino's. Read a review about the place and decided to take my party of five to Park Slope. WOW. We started with bruschette and a mozzarella appetizer. Then we got some pizzas and pastas. Vodka and margerita pie were amazing. Fusilli were amazing and i really enjoyed the orecciette pasta dish. All the food was tasty and the service was great. I would highly reccomend this place, quality food at the rite price. Peppino's is my new spot.",-1
1165,1,5,8/15/2011,"We have lived in Park Slope for three years and only now FINALLY have found a pizza place we love. Since we live about 14 blocks away, I hadn't realized they would deliver to us, but it was no problem. We ordered six large pizzas for a party (Margheritas and Diavolas), and the staff was incredibly friendly, responsive and right on time. Sometimes delivered pizza isn't so good, but this was still hot and just perfect. They were quick. I thought maybe I had ordered too much, but that definitely wasn't the case - everyone loved it. Will definitely order again and maybe trek over to eat at the restaurant, too.",-1
1166,1,5,6/22/2011,Best pizza in the slope. There thin crust margherita pizza is delicious. The crust is crunchy and the sauce is perfect. A few slaps of fresh mozzarella and you have a great pie of pizza. It can be a bit pricey compared to some other pizzerias but you pay for quality so I don't mind not one bit.,-1
1167,1,5,4/18/2011,"My husband has a love for brick oven pizza and when we found Peppino's on a weekend stroll through Park Slope he was in heaven. We ordered the Margherita pie well done (I don't like a soggy center) with extra fresh basil and it was DELICIOUS! Â The crust was perfect not too thick or too thin, the sauce was flavorful and there was just enough fresh mozzarella that you didn't feel guilty eating a slice or the whole pie, which we did :) Â The staff is very accomodating and attentive. Â We've made it our Saturday lunch spot and can't wait to try out all the other items on their menu. Â Happy Eating!",-1
1168,1,5,4/8/2011,"Seriously. Â I want to sew my *** shut so it would never leave me. Â This place has the best pizza ever. Â It's a weekly favorite at my apartment! Â I've only had delivery, never been there.... but wow! Â Get a large pie with peperoni, ham, sausage and mushroom. Â Mmmm",-1
1169,1,5,1/23/2011,Best Pizza in Brooklyn. I tried others and I have to say that they don't even come close. Cheesesteaks are great and the pasta dishes are real deal. Love this place.,-1
1170,1,5,8/30/2010,"Quite simply, the most delicious pizza you'll get in the slope. Whether a slice or a pie, it's an amazing taste sensation to rock your world!",-1
1171,1,5,5/18/2010,"I moved about a block away from Peppino's, and it quickly became my go to place for when I want a tasty margherita pizza. Â The atmosphere is comfortable inside, the waitstaff (er, waitress - it's been the same woman every time I've been) is incredibly nice, and the bruschetta is to die for. Â Seriously - my wife (a phenomenal cook) has been trying to replicate it at home, but something about the bread is hard to pin down. I recommend that you get a Caesar salad, a small margherita pizza, and the bruschetta to share if there are two of you and you're particularly hungry. Â  Also, if you want to split the salad, they go ahead and put it into two bowls for you. Â How cool is that for the down the street pizza joint?",-1
1172,1,5,4/5/2010,"WOW. I love the Margaretta pizza!, Thin crust crunchy, full of flavor its amazing but it doesn't end there. The past dishes are amazing, and the best thing about it is you can order specials and they will make it for you. The fish specials and the Baked clams are full of flavor and SO FRESH. When i walked into this place i was expecting a pizzeria what i got was a full on Italian gourmet restaurant... Its very cute and family oriented. The Pizza is amazing, original Margareta is the Best, and if you want something different i suggest you should try the Arugula Pizza! The Pasta is Fantastic. The sandwiches are amazing, esp the grilled chicken fresh mozzarella roasted peppers and balsamic vinegar.. Mouth Watering! The appetizers are amazing.Try the Baked Clams or the Bruschetta I am without question and beyond doubt a Fan For LIFE!!",-1
1173,1,5,11/18/2009,"Best Margherita pizza I've tasted ever, anywhere. Â The crust is thin and oven crisp, the mozzarella is fresh and delicious, and there are fresh basil leaves baked right on top. Â Too delicious! Â Fast local delivery too.",-1
1174,1,5,8/9/2008,Wow!!!! I was thoroughly surprised about this restaurant. The Penne a la Vodka was out of this world. I hear they have another restaurant in Bay Ridge. Wish there was one on every corner.,-1
1175,1,5,12/24/2014,"Excellent pizza, really friendly neighborhood place. Very generous portions for salad and pasta too -- and never a long wait for a table.",1
1176,1,4,12/21/2014,"Ate here last night, was able to get seated around 7pm immediately (there were 4 of us). I had a cappuccino with whipped cream and cinnamon which was delicious and warmed me up right away. The pizza was delicious as well! I forget the names, but I ordered a pizza with mushrooms, olives, ham, and artichokes - YUM! The crust was crunchy and I loved how I could really taste the smokey-ness from the brick oven. Would definitely come back/order takeout from them again!",1
1177,1,5,12/8/2014,Delicious food and great customer service! Will definitely return. We love getting the margarita pie with pepperoni and the kids love the penne vodka with chicken. Love this place. Top pizza joint in NYC.,1
1178,1,3,12/7/2014,"Good, not great. The pizza chef that deigns to use canned mushrooms commits the pinnacle of pizza heresy. Especially at $24.95 for a small (enough for two and leftovers), I expect someone to forage for even the most basic button 'shroom. Mellow about mushrooms, I am not. Other tasting notes: great crust, sauce on the watery side, quality sausage",1
1179,1,5,11/21/2014,"Wonderfully authentic brick oven pizza. Nothing pretentious about this place. Great pizza, great staff, great experience. I wish more places got it like this place gets it. Best pizza in the neighborhood, but would be worth going the extra mile to get here if I didn't leave here.",1
1180,1,5,11/16/2014,"We get plain pizza most of the time, half with pepperoni. My wife is very picky when it comes to pizza and she's obsessed with how great a pie is. I'm also really into their eggplant rolls - probably the best I've ever had. If the pricing scares you away, I suggest making the splurge. Totally worth it.",1
1181,1,5,10/28/2014,We love this pizza! Always delicious!!,1
1182,1,5,10/26/2014,The Diavola pizza was absolutely amazing and the service superb. I will definitely make this my new local regular pizza spot.,1
1183,1,5,10/24/2014,"Much needed review, this place is another awesome brick oven pizza place, good for a couple, or a sunday treat..fresh, yummy and Â the food presentation is classy ,service good,would recommend.",1
1184,1,5,10/22/2014,Yelp did not lead me astray on this recommendation. The small pizza is huge. We did ours half and half - prosciutto & the blanca. Both were so good and totally what you want when you think NY pizza.,1
1185,1,5,10/20/2014,"Came up to Brooklyn for the day to see a show, afterwards I just wanted somewhere quick, not too crowded, and that had beer available. Used Yelp to find this pizza joint. When we got there we ordered a round of drinks and a large Diavola. Took less than fifteen minutes for the pie to come out. Â The pie itself was awesome, I didn't want to stop eating it. I was actually almost tempted to order another pie to take home! The staff also was quick and really friendly. Thumbs up to Peppino's!",1
1186,1,5,9/28/2014,"This place serves the best good basic pizza in Park Slope. If you want a fancy pizza, go to Franny's but if you want good solid basic pizza, Peppino's is where you want to be.",1
1187,1,5,9/19/2014,"WOW. Â We looked at restaurants on our GPS under Italian and this came up. Â Walked in the smell would bring you to your knees. Â PLUS they were playing Italian Opera. My boss said if it is half as good as it smells we are in for a treat. Â Well it was better than that. Â My boss is a pro with Philly steaks and Philly Hoagies and he had one that he said was a HOMERUN! Â One of the best he has had. Italian food is my most favorite and I had Penne Alla Boscaiola. Â  OUT OF THIS WORLD. Â I have eaten in the ""little Italy's"" in Boston, New York, Scotland, San Francisco, Minneapolis MN to name a few. Â The food quality was 5 Diamonds that all I can say. Â I will make plans whenever I am NEAR this place to go in and try other items. Â Our tiny waitress with her cool black glasses (Tanya???) I do not remember was personable and just so funny about her restaurant. Try it you cannot lose!",1
1188,1,4,9/14/2014,I've never eaten at their storefront but I have ordered from them a lot and still do if I'm Â in the area. I'm not a big fan of brick oven pizza and never really had theirs so I can't really comment on the pizza but everything else they make from their heroes and rolls to the their pastas and salads are all on point. Their Philly cheese steaks are a bit salty but still among the Â best I've ever had in Brooklyn.,1
1189,1,3,9/14/2014,"I wish I could give this 3.5 stars, but I don't think it deserves 4. Good if not too acidic pizza. Everything else a little too rough around the edges. Very nice and attentive staff, they were very accommodating when we asked to exchange our dessert which was inedible (old and freezer burnt tasting amaretto ice cream).",1
1190,1,5,9/13/2014,Amazing brick oven pizza!! My gf & I tried it for the first time tonight and were blown away!! Definitely coming here again.,1
1191,1,5,9/10/2014,"Been here 100 times and it's always been delicious. I'm pretty sure I've tried everything on their menu and it's consistently good. I've been here for lunch, dinner, and events and the staff never disappoints me. If you go make sure you try their margherita pie and one of their cheese steak specials. You will be glad you did. Oh and just a random addition: I'm COMPLETELY obsessed with their muscles in red sauce. I get a tray every year for Christmas Eve and my family goes nuts over it!",1
1192,1,4,9/9/2014,"There are a bunch of Italian restaurants in Park Slope. Â I honestly like to avoid them because of the carbs, so coming here was just out of spontaneity. Â My mate had the garlic bread - even though there was already complimentary (nice and warm!) bread. Â Pizza dough slices were nice and toasty - though could use a touch more garlic. Â The sausage pasta alfredo was super yummy - though it sort of turns a bit into a greasy mess the next day (leftovers). Â Would be back if I ever have a carb hankering. Â Winter would be nice - as the oven is right next to the bathroom, super toasty!",1
1193,1,5,8/17/2014,"Just had dinner at Peppino's. Â We had spaghetti with meatballs - a huge heaping tasty platter and the make your own pizza (sweet italian sausage + mushrooms + pepperoni + onions) on a wheat crust. Â The pizza came out on the regular non-wheat crust but the owner/manager came out and apologized for the error and made up for it by making us another pie, same toppings, with wheat crust at no extra charge. Â We appreciated the excellent food, excellent service and the way they go the extra mile to make sure the customers are happy. Â Authentic Italian food with excellent service and a great atmosphere.",1
1194,1,5,8/2/2014,"Peppino's is a very solid neighborhood family friendly pizza restaurant. We usually get the margarita pizza, which is fantastic with very fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce. The servers are extremely friendly, and the pizza and sandwiches are just all great. The service, variety on the menu, and non existent lines (most of the time) make this place a go to for me and my girlfriend. I highly recommend this place!",1
1195,1,3,7/29/2014,First let me say the food is great. This is the 2nd time we were here both times the food had been great but the 2nd time the service was not good at all. We ordered a pizza ($27.00) - the black olives when the order came we had black olives on the pizza. If I am going to pay that much for a pizza at least get my order right.. We did not want to wait so we picked them off. I was expecting at least something off the pizza but no we almost did not even get a sorry. I also ordered a kids past for my boys to split it was $16.00 a little much for a kids order of pasta. We enjoyed the food but were not happy with the service or the price.,1
1196,1,4,7/27/2014,"Great service and great food. Â Lost a star due to hot, hot, hot bathroom with only scalding hot water out of sink. Â Cold faucet is burning, burning hot! Â I guess that's what happens when the bathroom is next to a wood cooking stove? Great food and great service though. Â Would happily return!",1
1197,1,5,7/26/2014,"The pizza is GREAT! And the service is BETTER! We ate a cheese pizza I can say every part of the pizza was on point. The crust,the pie, and the toppings were all fresh! Next time I come to Brooklyn this is the place that will have my business!",1
1198,1,5,7/25/2014,"Excellent pizza, was walking by and the recession special caught my eye, but the yelp reviews drew me in; the service and ultimately execution knocked it out of the park. The first time was just the recession special, an amazing deal at 5 and change for two slices and a fountain soda. What sealed it was ordering delivery had two large pies one plain and one pepperoni and the quoted delivery time was 30-45, however the pizza was here between 20-30 minutes. At the end of the day, the brick oven taste is the lasting memory but the attention to detail leaves you wanting more. As for the taste, I'm one for a million toppings on my pizza and i still prefer the plain.",1
1199,1,5,7/19/2014,"This place is amazing I really loved their appetizers specially the backed muscles abd the mozzarella basil salad, and the shrimp there is really good as well one of the places I really loved their food in New York.",1
1200,1,4,7/14/2014,"really good pizza, for a really good price.",1
1201,1,4,7/6/2014,"Great pizza with a fresh and crispy crust and wide variety of toppings. Definitely the best pizza in the area. The delivery is a bit spotty but I think that is mostly due to my ordering at high volume times. In addition, the owner, or maybe the manager on duty, called as a follow up to ensure my satisfaction with the order. I highly appreciate this kind of service, which is also present in the restaurant itself. The young wait staff is well trained and very accommodating. I look forward to many more meals in the family friendly neighborhood spot.",1
1202,1,5,6/28/2014,"This place makes an amazing pizza pie. Â Perfect crispness, tangy sauce, fresh mozzarella that doesn't make the pie damp, and the perfect amount of fresh basil. Â Our 6 & 7 year old nieces loved it too.",1
1203,1,4,6/16/2014,"I walk by this place every day and after a friend nominated it the best pizza in Park Slope, I felt compelled to try it. My boyfriend and I went here a few nights ago and had the bruschetta as an appetizer and a small half-pepperoni and cheese (his half) and half-pizza a la vodka (mine!) We were impressed! The bruschetta was fresh, full of onions and garlic (yum!). The pizza came out fairly quickly and I am definitely a fan of their brick oven style. The small pizza was more than enough for the two of us, especially after the appetizer. My boyfriend loved his little crispy pepperonis, and I loved the more bold flavors of my half. We each had a slice to take home to enjoy the next day. Our server was friendly and everything went smoothly! The restaurant itself is cute and casual, I would definitely come back when I'm in the mood for some good pizza.",1
1204,1,4,6/8/2014,"Here's another place I wish I had tried sooner, I mean it is in my neighborhood! Â I guess I always just ignored it because it replaced the beloved ""Aniello's"" pizzeria that was in the neighborhood for years and had become well known with the old school locals. But shame on me. In the mood for Italian but not wanting to stray to far, we went to check it out. Nice place and the food smelled fantastic as soon as you walk in. The waitresses were really nice and never made you feel awkward. Â We decided on the mixed salad, spaghetti and meatballs and the puttanesca pizza. The salad was delicious. Â romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, peppers, onions, olives, oil & balsamic vinegar. Tangy, fresh and very yummy. I must have it again. The spaghetti and meatballs were also very good. The meatballs tasted fresh and homemade. The pizza, which I loveeee! tomato sauce, capers, black olives, anchovies, oregano & fresh mozzarella. Delicious thin crust, made in a brick oven, which had a little salt and tang from the anchovies and olives, and the cheese melted so it was nice and crisp! They make pizza just the way I like!. I maybe could have done without the anchovies since I'm not a big fan, but it was nice for trying something new. And I believe they were not black olives but Kalamata, Â which I don't have no problem with! I am 100% going back here! Love it!",1
1205,1,5,5/25/2014,One of the best pizza and Philly cheesesteak I ever had! I order delivery and it was quick! I would be ordering from here from now on :)!!,1
1206,1,4,5/13/2014,Big Fan! Â love the pizza here! Staff is super nice.,1
1207,1,4,5/3/2014,"We ate here this evening with 4 adults and 2 kids ( 10 year old and 14 year old). We had pizza and two salads. I ordered the Tuna Salad which was made with high quality Italian (olive oil) Tuna. All the ingredients were fresh and the salad was delicious. The kids are living in Massachusetts and love ""New York PIzza."" Â and they were impressed as were the adults. Towards the end of the meal a manager or possible owner noticed the crust of the pizza in my husband's hand which was on Â a path to his mouth. Keep in mind that all the adults had slices and we had no complaints. The Lady offered to make us another pizza because she felt that this dark crust was too dark to meet their standards. We explained that we had no complaints and appreciated the offer but we were really to full to eat it. Then she said she would take it off the bill. The food was above average but the attention paid to customer satisfaction in this place is extraordinary.",1
1208,1,5,5/3/2014,Very nice simple and cozy place! They provide an amazing service. The Margarita pizza was soooo good: juicy and crispy. Tip: you get free soda refills which is really pleasant. :) love it! Thank you!,1
1209,1,5,5/3/2014,"Great Pizza Big servings Our waitress was super nice Free soda refills Simple, but excellent! Will Definitely come back.",1
1210,1,5,5/2/2014,"Peppino's isn't on any of those ""best pie"" lists for NYC, but I'm not quite sure why. Â The pizza is great and significantly cheaper than their competitors. Â The staff are very helpful and social, and you don't have the crazy wait like you do at Paulie Gee's, Roberta's, Motorino, etc. Â We made a trip out to Park Slope to try this place, and I'm glad we did. Â I will absolutely be visiting again!",1
1211,1,5,4/30/2014,This place is amazing. The good rocks the service is stellar and I'll be coming back time and time again. If you're looking for a great Italian restaurant in Park slope this is the place to go to. Highly recommended!!!,1
1212,1,5,4/28/2014,My boyfriend and I take out from here. It's so delicious!!!!,1
1213,1,5,4/27/2014,"Absolutely LOVE Peppino's!!! Walk in and you're greeted by an eclectic decor in honor of all things brooklyn/ Italian. What makes this place great? -1. Delicious food! You can't go wrong with ANYTHING! I promise you. From the pizzas to the seafood to the calzones, it's all melt in your mouth deliciousness. 2. Â FANTASTIC customer service. Wow! My family has been dining here for 5+ years and we have never ever had a bad experience. Because it's a family run business you can't help but feel part of the family. On the fence? Just try it out. It's worth every penny!",1
1214,1,5,4/24/2014,Great food great service. Â I always have the margarita pizza. Cesar salad Â with perino beer. Â It's like heaven. Â  Price us up there but worth the ingredients they use. It is not a tourist trap pizzeria,1
1215,1,5,4/14/2014,I am blessed to have Peppino's be my go to delivery pizza. To have a pie of such high caliber brought to my door is always a surprise.,1
1216,1,4,4/12/2014,"This place is fabulous. It's got a really classic, homey vibe (brick walls, kids' letters or drawings on the walls) and they serve a bunch of dishes with a wide price range. My fiance and I shared the veggie pizza and a bowl of garlic bread (basically pizza crusts with garlic and marinara sauce). The pizza was really good, the wine was good, the crusts slathered in oil and garlic were (obviously) good. There was definitely a substantial amount of noise coming from all the kids and families, but it sort-of just added to the laid-back atmosphere of the place. The family sitting at the next table dropped their whole pie onto the floor and the waitress assured them they could have another, on the house. That's a clear sign they want returning customers. Our waitress was very nice and since the place wasn't packed we were checked on about every thirty seconds (I think she was bored and wanted to chat). The only reason I took off one star is because I'm a vegetarian and I wish they had another veggie pizza option with ""meatier"" veggies (eggplant, artichokes, etc).",1
1217,1,5,4/9/2014,"Growing up on 10th Street in Park Slope, Brooklyn we had several outstanding Pizzeria's to choose from. So when taking my daughter and her fiance on a pizza quest I naturally had to stop in my old neighborhood and sample a slice from Anellio's, which wasn't there anymore. Instead Peppino's Brick Oven Pizzeria now occupies the location. I quickly looked up the comments on Yelp and saw that it was rated very high. Inside did not resemble anything from the old business. It does not resemble the familiar take style counter near the entrance, but rather a sit down set up. The Brick oven is now in the back in plane sight. We were greeted by a hostess and opted to take the Pizza to go. We ordered the Margarita with Meatballs. We sat at a table while we waited the the young girl brought us to go cups of water. Very nice touch. Within a few minutes our Pizza was ready. Brick ovens do cook very quickly. The Pizza looked and tasted fantastic. Sauce was sweet and fresh, the Mozzarella was fresh not the commercial shredded type, the meatballs were sliced homemade. The crust was thin, but not too thin. Not burned as most brick oven pizza can be. Texture of the crust was light, not chewy, with just the right amount of pull as you bite. Overall and excellent PIE. Good Service. My neighborhood still Rocks Great Pizza!",1
1218,1,5,4/6/2014,One of the best pizza places in Brooklyn. Also they have a fish salad and lentil soup that is incredible. The bread is always fresh and are always happy to get you more. Small casual place but the food is always great.,1
1219,1,5,3/23/2014,"My wife and I just ordered from here tonight, looking for a good pizza place in Park Slope. We've tried a few in and around the South Slope area - Smiley's, Pizza Plus, Enzo's, etc... - and Peppino's is far and away the best. We were told delivery would be 45 minutes, and our order arrived a shade under 25. A large, coal-fired pepperoni reminiscent of those you see at Juliana's, Roberta's, and Grimaldi's, and it was fantastic. Light, chewy crust, slightly spicy meat, flavorful sauce. It looks like we have found our local.",1
1220,1,5,3/21/2014,"I had the best margarita pizza ever here. Â The fresh mozzarella is wonderful, and their tomato sauce is amazing.",1
1221,1,4,3/20/2014,two slices with fresh cooked sausages very good,1
1222,1,3,3/12/2014,"Fast delivery, pretty good pizza (half margherita half puttanesca) I like more crunchy crust and this was not enough. I might try it again, eating in the pizzeria, because delivery is not for sure the best if you want crunchy staff... This time I was too hungry but next time I will make it crunchier warming it up on a non sticking flat pan.",1
1223,1,5,2/15/2014,"Really great pizza, and very nice family-vibe staff. Have ordered take out a bunch of times. Once when my girlfriend had called the wrong location by mistake for our pick up order, they apologized as though it was their mistake and sat me down with a complimentary glass of wine to wait for my order to be done. That's how you do it!",1
1224,1,5,2/6/2014,Came here yesterday after I went to the gym. I was hungry and needed some good pizza so I turned to yelp. This place showed good reviews and the outside looked nice and clean so I gave it a shot. I ordered a small regular pie and it was so good I ate it all myself. Although I was very full it was worth every drop. It has a crispy crust the sauce is just right and the cheese isn't cheap. If your passing by stop in cause it's worth it. Great cozy ambiance inside a little nicer then a typical pizza joint.,1
1225,1,5,2/3/2014,"So a friend is over my somewhat secluded spot in Gowanus and rather than peruse 4th/5th ave for a place to eat they ask me ""What's good around here?"", that's when I don't even think, like a math equation I just say ""You should get Peppino's."" And usually they get Peppino's. It was the first meal I had when I moved to Gowanus and I won't have to look anywhere else for pizza. As long as I am ordering a pie it will be from Peppino's(I say pie because I'm not sure if they have slices). Â It is so authentic, like the pies I've had in Italy. Fresh mozzarella, crispy crust that's chewy but also has a slight char. The sauce uses good tomatoes and has texture, it is also well seasoned. I've dined in and ordered out -- consistency is the same. Check this place out for italian fare if you are in the area and you definitely will not be disappointed. They have great customer service too, I'm pretty sure it is family owned and operated and from the waitress to the manager they all treat patrons like they are invested in the restaurant and it's success.",1
1226,1,5,1/24/2014,"My foodie troupe and I usually choose trendy Manhattan spots, but when I suggested coming to my apartment in Brooklyn (the horror!), we wanted to keep dinner easy and nearby. We meandered down 5th Avenue to Peppino's - recommended to me in passing by a local friend. The space reminds me a lot of a restaurant that I'd find in my farmerville hometown in PA. No bells and whistles. Plastic tablecloths. High school wait staff. FANTASTIC pizza. Cheap bill. Perfect!",1
1227,1,2,1/12/2014,I was expecting better pizza after reading the reviews. Kinda over priced too.,1
1228,1,5,1/12/2014,"Came in on a Sunday afternoon. Wasn't too busy. There was a great, throwback vibe to the place. Checkered tablecloths, bottles of soda, a bright red neon sign in the back. It just felt like old America. As I sit down, I am promptly greeted by my waitress, who runs me through the menu like a pro and recommends the vodka pie. She was very friendly and eager to please. She brought me delicious free bread and joked with me throughout my meal. I received my pizza prompt and hot. It was fantastic. The ingredients played off each other in perfect harmony. Prosciutto, mushrooms, cheese, basil. With each bite I wanted more. It was the best NYC pizza experience I've ever had.",1
1229,1,5,1/9/2014,"This place might not have the scene that Lucali's and Giuseppina's have, it definitely doesn't have the exposure and hype of places like Di Fara, L&B's and Lombardi's, but if you peel all of that way away, this place can hold its own with any pizza restaurant in New York. Â In a blind taste test with the top 10 NYC pizza places, it would, at the very least, be a contender. Â Their pastas and sides are also very good, but food aside I love the feeling you get from Peppino's when you walk in. The place is truly a family-run business that focuses on one thing: giving diners a great experience.",1
1230,1,1,1/3/2014,"The pizza sauce tastes worse than from a can, watery like consistency. Toppings thrown on, too much ricotta on white pizza. Garlic crisps were soggy flavorless leftover pieces of crust.",1
1231,1,3,12/8/2013,I've been here twice. I got the spinach ravioli both times and it was really good. I do have a complaint though. I went there yesterday at around 10pm and this place was filthy! The floors were disgusting and we had to wipe crumbs out of our seats.,1
1232,1,5,11/7/2013,"This place is amazing! My boyfriend lives right by it and we came across this gem last year in the winter and it was so warm, cozy and smelled DELICIOUS. We ended up deciding to split a chicken roll, OMG so great and it was huge! It was enough to satisfy us both! The people that run the place are also as nice as can be, countless times they have given us garlic crisps on the house. Only downfall, closed mondays. I almost cried when i forgot that and we were outside their door.",1
1233,1,5,11/7/2013,"My wife and I moved across the street from Park Slope Peppinos about a year ago. We've been regulars ever since. I kept saying I was going to give a good shout out on yelp, but never got around to it. Tonight I just had to do it. My wife and I brought our 5 month old in here tonight, and once again, they treated us like family. After long hard days, it just feels great. I've lived in NYC for over 20 years and never felt such a family vibe as I do here. But we wouldn't come here regularly for that - it's also the case that the food is great. It just is. My mom is 100% Italian and I grew up eating the best. This is in the same league. We are so happy to have moved across the street from this gem.",1
1234,1,4,11/3/2013,"So far I've ordered a regular pie, margarita pie, chicken Cesar salad & chicken roll, all were very good. I see that this place has good rating for there plates, I'm yet to try it; but will soon. They lost a star because one day I called to order I believe a salad and a drink, they wouldn't deliver it because I was off by I believe two dollars, I really hate when places do this, like seriously...two dollars and you won't deliver it a couple of blocks, I really don't think the delivery person is going to mind considering he will get a tip, and why would a business want to lose out on $8 just because it wasn't $10. I'd rather have $8 more dollars than none, but hey that's me. So I guess when I order just for myself I have to get something extra that I really don't want just to have it delivered.",1
1235,1,5,11/1/2013,"My family love this place. I rarely write reviews . . . Â Every time I come either for a pizza or for say eggplant parm . or seafood platter etc I am not disappointed. we also are treated so well, like family. if you see the seafood platter as a special other it, it is amazing.",1
1236,1,5,10/26/2013,"Brooklyn is known to have some of the best pies known to the Americas and after sampling so many pizza joints in Brooklyn, probably the best I have ever tasted is right around the corner of our house!!! After living here for over a year, Didn't even know we were missing out on one of the best pizzas my tastebuds have ever known. I'm sorry tastebuds, but now you can now be oh si satisfied . The bread!!! Is it the water? The moisture & them pasture in the oven ? Chewy thin , crisp and the sauce is too die for. Kids were over the moon with their pasta which u tried and almost switched to eating theirs. No line, no over hyped advertising , just a great family Italian restaurant who likes kids.",1
1237,1,5,9/11/2013,"Happend to be in the area and was looking for someplace to eat. Â We stopped in here after reading the reviews on yelp. Â I originally passed it and looked in thinking, ""Man it looks hot in there"" because the whole front was open. Â Not realizing that was the place I was looking for but I took a chance. Â We had lasanga w/ a mixed vegetables on the side, spinach ravioli, tomato and mozzarella. Â The bread to start was slightly different. Â  Tasted homemade similar to pizza dough. Â Either way it was delisious. Â The tomato and mozzarella was fresh and tasty. Â Our dinners were both very good. Oh and the mixed vegetables were real mixed veggies they put together not from a bag. Was very happy I stopped in and I will be back. Â Also, it was not hot in the restaurant at all.",1
1238,1,5,9/8/2013,"It's a miracle! I have found my Italian food sanctuary! After a couple drinks at the local bar, we walked up to 5th ave and were torn between the diner and this place that I caught in the corner of my little brown eye. We flipped a coin (literally) and lucky for us the choice was Peppinos. As we were walking in a big group was leaving. Since it was close to 11pm I was afraid they were getting ready to close but the owner of the place assured us it was alright, making us feel right at home. Though they were cleaning up not ONCE did they try and rush us. The waitress was super sweet and friendly, and the food came out quickly. We didn't get to try the bread since they were out but they did give us some free pieces of bruschette. This was heaven in my mouth! The bread was so warm and moist, garlicky goodness underneath a bed of delicious red onions and tomatoes. SOOOO GOOD! I also love Pasta Fagioli so I got a bowl. This wasn't as great...kind of bland. Think it needed a garlic clove and some salt but good nonetheless. Next came out my Penne Alla Vodka and my friend's Penne Alla Boscaiola. It was delicious! They give you a ton of food, and the flavor was on point. The peas really added to the whole dish. My friend's food was equally appetizing. I will say the prices are a wee bit higher than the average Italian spot but Â this place totally makes it worth it. After gobbling up what we could from our huge pasta plates, the owner chit chatted with us as they got ready to close and gave us some menus so we can order next time we were at work. It's been a while since I've had such a friendly staff serve me. Great food, great people. Can't wait to come back and try some brick oven pizza!",1
1239,1,4,9/7/2013,"Peppino's make really, really good pies it has to be said, although I've never been to their Bay Ridge location. Â A little pricey, sure, but they have Park Slope real estate prices to be dealing with and the ingredients are high quality. Â Top notch sauce and good cheese, they're only a few yards behind the tall trees like Totonno's and Juliana's in the crust stakes, but it's high praise even putting them in the same sentence. Â  In any other town, this place would hold legendary status - too bad they're in the pizza mecca of Brooklyn.",1
1240,1,4,9/1/2013,"Best pizza in south park slope. Â I don't know if it's because clearly all the Italians go here or that it is also Italian run, but ya it is pretty damn good. Â I get the baby size (ie personal pizza) margherita.",1
1241,1,5,8/28/2013,"Delicious pizza. Reminds me of Grimaldi's minus the wait time. Chewy crust, savory cheese, flavorful sauce. The Margherita pizza here is fantastic. The restaurant is cute and service here is good. A nice little pizza joint in Park Slope.",1
1242,1,4,8/16/2013,"The food here is absolutely delicious. And it's just a calm environment where it's always pleasant to sit down and eat, even when it's crowded. Friendly staff. Prices aren't too bad.",1
1243,1,4,8/15/2013,"I live nearby, and I discovered this place a few months ago, as I had an urge to have some pizza, so I walked in. Â I was shocked at how good the pizza was in such an unassuming place! The pizza looks like it's made from fresh ingredients, and it tastes like so. The more and more I eat this pizza the more I'm liking it, so far it hasn't disappointed. The service is not that good, at least a couple of times I went with some friends, seems like they have to work on training their employees. But, as long as they keep producing such great pizza, I'll ignore the so-so service.",1
1244,1,4,8/11/2013,"Really good pizza here. The diavola is awesome, the sausage is really fresh and has a bit of spice that makes it very enjoyable. Beer's a little pricey at 4.50 for a Brooklyn pint, but it's not a bar, so I can let it pass. I'd like to go back and give their cheesesteaks a world. I thought the prices were pretty reasonable too.",1
1245,1,4,7/24/2013,"If, for the rest of my life, I could either only go to this place or to Franny's, I would choose Peppino's in a heartbeat. It's not fancy, it doesn't serve ramps, and you're more likely to see an off-duty cop eating there than a Gyllenhaal -- but it's delicious, mellow, and affordable. Every waiter I've had has been friendly and attentive. The pizza arrives quickly and with a nice slight char on its crust. Whenever I eat here, I leave full and in a good mood, which is more than I can say about a whole bunch of restaurants that regularly appear on the lists of the Best this or that. Go! (But don't make it so crowded that I have to wait for a table).",1
1246,1,4,7/17/2013,"We frequently order here for staff meetings. They sandwiches are the winner...chicken parm, eggplant parm, grilled chicken w/ balsamic, & cheesesteak make everyone happy. To feed 40 people under $250 and still have food left over is great in my book.",1
1247,1,5,7/9/2013,Service was great and my favorite thing on the menu -- CHEESE STEAK SPECIAL! It's one of the tastiest! Â I always order delivery and they're always quick and food still taste great.,1
1248,1,1,6/21/2013,"We were scheduled to play a Make Music New York festival performance at Peppino's South Slope today and the manager was such a complete jerk. Â We were scheduled by the Park Slope 5th Ave BID to play there and it was made clear there would be electricity available, but the manager made it clear that he didn't know anything about it, in spite of the MMNY poster taped to the inside of his front window, and that he was too busy to direct me to an outlet to run power out to the street. Â He spent more time making calls about the situation and telling me that he was busy than would have been required to plug in a power cord. Â Amazingly, he walked away from free music, and world class musicians that would surely have drawn a crowd and gotten the business more money. Â Please don't go here for food as there are may pizza places in South Slope and many of them have reasonably polite managers who make good business decisions.",1
1249,1,4,6/12/2013,"Tasty pizza, decent size meals.. they are generous on their subs too. The salad is average, wasn't so fond of it but they have speedy service. If you want your food and you want it fast, check them out.. you wont be disappointed.",1
1250,1,4,6/11/2013,"Went to Peppinos tonight and it was very good....The atmosphere is welcoming and the service was great! Â We had the mozzarella and tomato to start off (so fresh), then the pizza (half vodka and half Margherita) the crust was so crisp and chewy at the same time..and then finished with pasta (sauce was very homemade and delish!!). Â The staff was polite and always checking in on us to see if we needed anything. Definitely a place to have a nice casual dinner...I will definitely be back. Thanks Peppino for giving me a new spot to hangout with friends and also a place to bring my out of town guest! YUM!",1
1251,1,5,5/31/2013,"SO GOOD. Â The pizza was delicious (we had spicy sausage and olives), and the service was prompt, polite, and friendly. Â I've lived in the neighorhood for three years, and I can't believe it's taken me this long to discover Peppinos. Â The decor and ambience is a bit lacking, but we will definitely be returning.",1
1252,1,4,5/30/2013,"Great brick oven pizza in Park Slope with friendly staff. Â The restaurant itself doesn't really stand out, looks like your typical neighborhood pizza joint but the brick oven pies are definitely better than any other I've had in the vicinity. Â If they had their 2 slices for $5 special late at night I'd be here all the time!",1
1253,1,4,5/13/2013,"I have to admit, I wasn't sure what to expect when walking in, and didn't expect the pizza here to be as good as it was. We started with the bruschetta, which was delicious. The bread was toasted perfectly; crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Though I don't remember details, the pizza was delicious. We ordered a large Margherita, and each component had a distinct and robust flavor. Not too sure how to feel about the ambiance. It was OK, but the opera music was a bit too dramatic for the restaurant, and the superimposed family pictures on the wall were too personal and intimate for my taste. The service was good. I usually like to write longer reviews, with more details, but it's been a little while since I visited Peippino's. Since everything was enjoyable, there's a good chance I will return and update my review, but the pizza earns a solid four stars.",1
1254,1,5,5/10/2013,This is the best Italian restaurant ever. The pizza is excellent. Â I have also had the eggplant parm and pasta dishes which were all very good. Â The service is excellent too. I will definitely keep coming back.,1
1255,1,5,5/8/2013,"My husband and I have been twice so far and both times we were very happy with the service and food. The first time my husband got a pizza and I got the mixed salad with chicken. The salad was really good for a pretty simple salad, but if you'er a salad eater you know how easy it is for places to mess it up. Our second visit we ordered a meatball sub and salad to share and both were really good and they even split them for us, which I thought was really nice. We will def. be back!",1
1256,1,5,4/16/2013,"I am not sure what took us so long to find this place but we finally decided to try Peppino's after living in the neighborhood for almost two years. I could kick myself now that I know what we have been missing. They have perfected the pizza here. There is no comparison with other pizza by the slice joints in the area. The wood burning, brick oven makes all the difference. The pizza was fantastic but more than that, the service was above and beyond. Our server, Vito, was such a sweet guy!!! I never realized since we headed home after our meal but I left my wallet at Peppino's. It was hand delivered to our door by an employee at Peppino's. Everything was in it's place. Thank you so much Peppino's. You have two more loyal customers!",1
1257,1,4,4/4/2013,"We were a huge group of 16 yesterday for lunch, and they sat us right down. Â We ordered a billion pizzas and tons of salads and they didn't blink. Â Peppino's is really great! Â The food we ate was delicious, the service was top notch, and the price didn't break the bank. Â This was an absolutely glorious NYC Pizza experience. Â I'd recommend that anyone and everyone check this place out.",1
1258,1,4,3/28/2013,"I came here on a Sunday night, there was quite a few people. It had a nice atmosphere. I've ordered pick up from here before but never ate in, but this Sunday was different! We got a bottle of wine, La Bastardo, which was delicious! (And I hardly ever really like red wines) We got olive and spinach on a margherita pizza and garlic bread to start. I enjoyed their garlic bread, there was plenty. The pizza itself had a good crunch to the crust and it had noticeably fresh ingredients. Service was welcoming and friendly, plus the restaurant had a home-y feel.",1
1259,1,5,3/16/2013,great brick oven pizza. Â very friendly and helpful staff. Â In my opinion the best pizza in brooklyn.,1
1260,1,5,2/25/2013,I'm a lifelong Brooklyn resident who loves pizza. And I loved the pizza here. Â This place has great brick oven pies. Cheese is real and fresh with just the right amount of saltiness. The sauce was absolutely delicious. The crust has just the right amount of burn to it. Loved it. Will def go back prices were good. Portion size was good for two to split on one six slice pie. Good service. And a nice clean atmosphere.,1
1261,1,5,2/7/2013,"This place has a great ""neighborhood pizza place"" vibe that I loved. Â Red checkered tablecloths, parmesean and dried chili pepper shakers on the tables, friendly waitresses and staff, decent beer and wine list, and some nice menu items, mellow and kid-friendly atmosphere. But the best part about it - the pizza is WAY BETTER than your average ""neighborhood pizza place"". Â The brick oven pies come out steaming hot with just the right amount of char to give it great flavor. Â Tangy sauce and real mozzarella cheese. Â The crust is light and relatively thin, with just the right amount of ""stretch"" and chewiness to it (but definitely not too chewy). I eat a lot of pizza. Â I love pizza. Â And this place really got me. Â Not to mention, they were extra-accommodating when we wanted to split our pie 5/8ths 3/8ths, vs. half and half. Â That was great. Love love love. Â Will be back.",1
1262,1,5,1/24/2013,"I looove pizza, and this is IT. Second best to Grimaldis (which is my favorite) At Peppinos i've tried the Vodka Pie with Whole Wheat crust which was fantastic and the steak hoagie that was soo juicy it melts in your mouth. Check this place out, its a winner.",1
1263,1,4,1/15/2013,"Great italian joint. Great food and reasonable prices. Their brick oven pizza is AMAZING. If you haven't experienced Peppinos yet, you must.",1
1264,1,4,1/13/2013,Unfortunately I'm writing this review very late. I was here almost a year ago. Anyways I'm going to keep this simple. Brick oven pizza is always the way to go when u can. The pizza here is really good and I do plan on going back again. The prices do not reflect your average pizza spot but this is not your average pizza spot. If you find yourself in the area you should definitely atop in and try their pizza. It's really good!,1
1265,1,5,1/11/2013,"Professional service, delicious food, and consistency; what more can you ask for in catering and for dinner. Â We've had them cater several family gatherings and they went far beyond what was expected; following up and coming back to make things absolutely perfect. Â Can't say enough about these guys.",1
1266,1,5,1/3/2013,"I enjoy going there ,never let me down. Always fresh",1
1267,1,4,1/3/2013,"Peppinos is delicious. Â The garlic crisps are a MUST. Â I'm a big Penne Vodka pizza fan so I would recommend that, but all their pizzas are pretty delicious. Â Their deliver times are a bit slow though so they lost a star from me. Â However, if you get a chance to walk in and try some food you definitely should. Â The waiters are quite nice.",1
1268,1,4,12/31/2012,"I scoped this place out when looking for some conveniently located pizza in Brooklyn. Â I like brick oven pizza more than standard New York pizza, so this looked like a pretty promising restaurant. The staff is friendly here; it really seems like a neighborhood joint. Â They seemed to know their customers by name, based on what I gathered from the few others people there that time of day. I was delighted to see that they served Boylan's bottled sodas. Â This is one of my favorite soft drink bottlers, and their ginger ale in particular goes great with this type of food. I went with a half margherita and half alla vodka pizza, individual sized. Â This was a pretty good brick oven pizza, but not the very best I have had. Â The alla vodka was much better than the margherita. Â If I could try again, I would go with the Pizza Bianca or Puttanesca instead. Both halves could have used a little more goodies; the prosciutto seemed a bit sparse. Overall, this is a very good neighborhood pizza place, but not the best brick oven pizza you can find. Â It's not a destination, but probably a place I would frequent often if I lived nearby.",1
1269,1,4,12/26/2012,"I am obsesseddd with their cheesesteak. Thanks to Elizabeth R.'s review, I gave it a try and now, always order it for lunch.. eat half and take the other half home for later. The delivery is always fast and they usually get my order right and put whatever else it is I request in the bag (forks, parm, napkins, etc.) Wouldn't hesitate ordering.. do itt!!",1
1270,1,4,12/10/2012,"Peppinos is pretty nondescript both inside and out. The true treasure is in its brick oven pizzas. I have only had the standard margherita pie, but the crust is thin, crispy, flavorful, and the cheese and sauce are outstanding. It is close in distance to us and also in quality to some of the better pizza places in Park Slope and the prices are definitely great for the quality. If you are by yourself or in a small group, they do offer personal and medium pies. They also offer a special lunch deal of 2 slices and a soda for $5 - but I think that pizza is the standard cheese pie found at any parlor.",1
1271,1,5,12/9/2012,"This place is in my grandma's neighborhood. Â We're from NJ so we don't come often, but this is definitely my husband's favorite Italian restaurant. Â Everything we've had from here has been delicious!",1
1272,1,5,11/27/2012,"tip: great brick oven pizza place with garlic crisps Diavola and Margherita were very crispy, tomato sauce very fresh. Â i imagine they would only be good when their just out of the brick oven, else the crust would be soggy real fast. Â garlic crisps are awesome, very garlicky.",1
1273,1,5,11/11/2012,Excellent service and the food is so amazingly delicious. This restaurant has a moms and pops type feeling. You feel cozy and can enjoy your meal without being squished into small tables.,1

1275,1,4,11/10/2012,"One of the better Pizza places in the slope. Â They do sell cheese slices at lunch but is more of a sit down/deliver whole pie place. Â It's also less fancy than some of the more high-end pizza joints, with checkerboard tablecloths. Â  Pies are made to order in a wood-fired oven, which is key. Â Hot, tasty, brimming with ingredients. Â  If you want good pizza in a casual place, Peppinos will bubble your cheese.",1
1276,1,5,11/8/2012,"As far as Pizza goes, NY has a crazy amount of spots to try. But the best pizza I have come across is from Peppinos! It cheesy goodness will make anyone's day better, and I am not usually a pepperoni slice of pizza person, but here I am all about it! Every Saturday for lunch I come here to get two slice's of pizza and a soda for $5, closer to $6 if you get pepperoni. Many pizza places have that deal, but this pizza is REAL pizza, and I was so suprised that this place would have that special. If you're in the neighborhood, please make sure you get a slice of something amazing!",1
1277,1,4,10/29/2012,"Possibly, maybe, on a good day the best pizza in South Brooklyn. The problem here is consistency. Some days this pizza is absolutely perfect and some days it's soggy and a little gross. This is actually a 50-50 issue here. But the days when it's good, it's goooood.",1
1278,1,4,10/11/2012,Peppinos in Park Slope is a friendly restaurant that makes very good brick oven pizza. The crust is exceptional if you like thin crusted pizza. The other ingredients were also quite good though we thought the sauce was a little too light and watery. All the serve staff made us feel welcome. It is a nice place for a midweek dinner.,1
1279,1,5,9/9/2012,"While we have never eaten in the restaurant, my fiancÃ© and I have faithfully ordered delivery from Peppinos for about a year now. Their sandwiches are amazing!!! Finally, someone who knows how to make an eggplant hero! They are consistently friendly, fast, and the food always arrives piping hot. Every time we try a new dish on the menu, we are impressed!",1
1280,1,4,8/24/2012,Solid brick oven pie.,1
1281,1,5,7/30/2012,"I love it so much.I was very sad when we had to move from south slope to sunset park as I would not get to go there as often as I want, or just walk past it every day. But they delivered the food to our area too.",1
1282,1,3,7/18/2012,Food is okay if you pick the correct one ! Service was okay.Bit pricey,1
1283,1,5,7/17/2012,"On first moving to Brooklyn from down South, I figured I was trading barbeque for pizza and set about trying to find a suitable pie that I could have delivered or was, at a minimum, easy to obtain. After a lot of trial and error (really just a lot of error), I finally stumbled upon Peppinos and haven't looked back since. This is my go to spot for a traditional NY style pizza these days. Sure, there are pizza joints that are arguably better but unless the pie is made of solid platinum, I'm not standing in line for an hour or more to get it. At the end of the day, it's just pizza. I'd much prefer a pizza that's nearly as good (and Peppinos is nearly as good) that comes right to my door. Peppinos pies start with a subtle and slightly sweet tomato base, then layered with fresh mozzarella and adorned with your choice of toppings. The pies are cooked in a coal fired oven so you get that spectacular blackening of the crust on the bottom. It really is a top notch pizza. Is this my favorite pie? No, that honor goes to the Tartufata at Toby's. But this is, by far, the best delivery pie I've had in NYC. Well worth giving Peppinos a shot on one of those nights where you just have no desire to cook anything and are craving a great slice.",1
1284,1,4,6/24/2012,We order pizza here at least once a month and every time it is great. We love the margarita pepperoni pizza - the pepperoni is tasty and the mozzarella is delicious! Plus you get pretty fast delivery. Have to love that!,1
1285,1,2,6/18/2012,"Wanted to love it. Â Looked great coming out. Â Fell short though. Too much oil/grease. Â Good amount of cheese and sauce and even the crust had a good texture (not too soft, not too crispy or charred) but just no flavor. 2 stars since I sure have experienced better slices. But 5 stars for friendly service and a $5.00 2 slice/soda Recession deal!! Nice owners I'd say.",1
1286,1,4,6/3/2012,"On one of our shopping trips in Park Slope, we wander in the neighborhood looking for a quick place to stop for lunch. We noticed Peppinos in the area. Their chicken caesar salad was delicious! Hearty and filling heaps of romaine lettuce, crouton, and chunky pieces of grill chicken in casear dressing. We also shared a baby margherita pizza, piping hot thin crust with fresh mozzarella, Â tomato sauce, basil, and olive oil. Normally, we would had indulge ourselves if it weren't for our sweet tooth crave here and there. Luckily, we saved room for dessert since my husband spot another place nearby. I'll def be back to try their pasta and bread. Loved the friendly service as well!",1
1287,1,5,6/3/2012,"Not sure how I've gone so long without rating this place. Â I eat here at least once every other week and I go here any time we have family or other out of town guests. Â The margarita pizza is one of the best I've ever had. Â I usually add pepperoni. Â As good as it is to get delivered, sinking my teeth into a piping hot pizza in the restaurant is fantastic. Â  Seating in the actual restaurant is surprisingly easy and surprisingly child friendly. Â We don't have kids but it's nice to know of a place that is easy to navigate for friends.",1

1289,1,3,5/24/2012,"Decent pizza, albeit slightly soggy and limp (maybe from delivery time?). Wife's Raviolis were excellent and the sauce on them were phenomenal - may try a pasta dish next time as the red sauce was delicious.",1
1290,1,5,5/22/2012,This place is absolutely wonderful. The wait staff is extremely courteous and attentive and the brick oven pizza is incomparable to others in Brooklyn or other boroughs. They also have pasta and sandwiches that are worth trying. The restaurant has a very home-ey and relaxed atmosphere that makes you want to go back and bring your friends and family.,1
1291,1,5,5/15/2012,I just moved to Park Slope and wanted to grab a quick bite to eat. Little did I know I was about have one of the best pizza and prosciutto sandwich ever. Love the doo wop / Frankie Valli mix playing over the speakers as well. Can't wait to go back and try some of the pastas.,1
1292,1,5,5/15/2012,"Local pizza place worth going out of your way for. The Pizza a la Vodka is crazy good. John's on Bleeker is probably my favorite pizza place in NY, but this is a close second, way better than Grimaldi's. It can be a little pricey but you'll be satisfied. The pasta and heros are good as well. The garlic crisps and bread are yummy and plentiful and the salads are a good size (and their vinegar is delicious.) Other apps have been good as well. Delivery is reliable and accurate with the time estimation they give you. They are also super nice.",1
1293,1,5,4/28/2012,"My first time at Peppino's and thanks to fellow Yelpers we decided to stop for pizza at this restaurant before getting on the Verrazano bridge and returning to Virginia. Â I grew up on Long Island, so I know good pizza and I couldn't let our group leave without tasting some authentic NY pizza. Â The place is tiny, but efficient, the service was friendly and fast. Â The food is outstanding! They cook in a brick oven, and everything has the most amazing crust with a char. Â Our drinks arrived quickly, fresh bread was brought to the table. Â The bread was simple but amazing. Â We decided to split a Margherita pizza, a plain calzone and a meatball parmigiana roll. Â The pizza was absolutely delicous, the calzone was THE BEST I've ever tasted. Â The meatball parmigiana roll was very good, but the previous two items were outstanding. Â  The manager insisted upon making us a second pizza because there was Â a hole (we didn't see it) in the first pizza since the center was too thin. Â We said it wasn't necessary but he insisted, so we had another pizza to take with us and we left a great tip for our server. I'm nosy so I had to ask the table next to us what they'd ordered, their pizza had prosciutto and mushrooms and they were raving about it. Â Definitely worth the money, great food, great service, good prices. Â Business is booming too, there were tons of carry out and delivery orders leaving. Â  I can't wait for my next trip to New York, a meal at Peppino's will definitely be on our itinerary!",1
1294,1,5,4/18/2012,"I can't help myself any longer. Â I have to upgrade to 5 stars. Â This place is just outstanding, regardless of the high tariff. Â The pizza and pasta dishes are ridiculously good, as are the few apps I've tried, as well as their home-made bread. Â To top it all, the staff are always so friendly, helpful and pleasant. Â Top notch.",1
1295,1,4,3/26/2012,"GREAT margherita pizza! i really enjoyed it. the personal (10"") with a salad was good for two meals. $17, so a little pricey for pizza but i have no regrets. the tomato sauce was perfect and the mozz cheese fresh. the brick oven added the perfect authentic touch. i'll definitely be back for more of this",1
1296,1,3,3/19/2012,"We tried Peppinos for the first time and placed an order for delivery. I will give them 5 stars for customer service but only 2.5 stars for food. The guy who took my order was very sweet, when he heard i was ordering for the 1st time, he gave us a complimentary appetizer and also upgraded our baby size pizza to a medium pizza for free. Delivery was quick. So they did great on the service side. Now on the food side, the bruschette was tasty. The mozzarella and tomato was ok. The mozzarella was not very fresh. The marinara pizza was very bland. The sauce lacked flavors. Overall the pizza was quite tasteless. The veggie pie pizza was better. It was loaded with a lot of chunky vegetables. But once again, overall the pizza was lacking flavors. It was missing the taste of fresh herbs. Their service was definitely excellent, but food was not!",1
1297,1,5,3/4/2012,"I've been holding off trying Peppino's because I thought they looked pricey. $15 for a small pizza? I took the plunge and decided to order a 'baby' size pizza. I thought to myself, ""I can't order a baby size pizza, i'm a man! A MAN!"" But then I figured, how small can the pizza actually be? So I ordered the Quatro Stagioni pizza for pickup. It was a BEAUTIFUL pizza. Probably about 10 inches wide, with 4 slices. All of the ingredients high quality, and the crust with the right amount of char. I never used to understand why having a little bit of a blackened edge is a good thing. If your pizza has tons of tasty toppings, the blackened part helps to clean your palate a little bit between slices. Otherwise, the flavors(and oils) build up in your mouth until it just doesn't feel right anymore. I can't wait to go back to this place and try all of their other stuff(some good looking pastas and sandwiches). I should also mention that their staff was extremely friendly, even on crowded, busy night. That tells me that this place is quality.",1
1298,1,3,2/21/2012,"Nice pizza restaurant. Marguerita pizza is great, but expensive",1
1299,1,5,1/17/2012,"Man, what a great night at Peppino's. So we were a party of 3 and we took the large table in the window for the street view and the leg room. Great service, he talks us into making a good beer choice (a small run Italian hefeweizen with a nice looking bottle). A large party comes in, and they ask us if they can get the big table. We oblige, being polite dapper gentleman on the eve of our show at Freddy's Bar down the way. The restaurant gives us a Bruschetta and another beer on the house (we had one initially split 3 ways). Great Bruschetta. And the pizza? Molto bene. Brick crust and everything melt in your mouth. The table that bumped us? Tossed another 2 more of those beers. Great things do happen to beautiful people. Great and attractive staff, prompt service, and the food had it goin' on. I would come back, with bells on.",1
1300,1,4,1/16/2012,"Definitely the best delivery pizza in Park Slope. Compared to other local pizza that has rubbery crusts or weird tasting sauces, this pizza was really good. It will definitely be our go-to place for pizza delivery.",1
1301,1,5,1/7/2012,I'm so glad they're just a few blocks away. I don't really like pizza but when that pizza has mushrooms and vodka sauce on it with fresh ingredients I get easily addicted. And so does my roommate. Plus they have a two slice drink recession special that beats most other meals in this area. Yesss!,1
1302,1,4,12/13/2011,Great Italian takeout!,1
1303,1,5,11/21/2011,"This place does it right. The pizza is what we go for. Brick oven, tasty sauce, quality toppings, chewy/crispy/light crust, reasonable price, AND consistency (aka never burnt) ?!? You get it all here. We are often here after 9 pm with the family for a late night pizza with friends. Kids are totally OK. The service is amazing. It must be family run. You don't get that kind of calm confidence and mastery of the menu from just anyone, Everyone is laid back but cares about what come out of the kitchen. Message to Peppinos: PLEASE DON'T LEAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD! The entire family loves this place. When you say ""hey, let's grab a pizza"" and the kids chime back ""Peppinos?,"" it's all good ...",1
1304,1,3,10/1/2011,"I've only ever had deliveries so can't comment on the restaurant experience. Love the Pizza Alla Vodka. Perfect base and a great mix of toppings. Also the Orrechiettie pasta is awesome as long as you like a lot of oil and garlic, the latter of which I actually don't (I realize this makes me a freak) but I eat it anyway it's just that good. Fusilli Fridiavola is well worth it too. Delivery is a little slow at peak times but that's not really an issue. Two things bother me for which they lost a couple of stars (it'd be 1.5 stars if this was an option). Firstly, we ordered a Diavola pizza and it was not good. Not bad, just not good. Too much tomato not enough cheese and sausage. It might have been an off day. Secondly, and more importantly, it is expensive. I just don't think a pizza should ever cost $25 once you add the tax. The pizza is big but not THAT big. It is yum though. I kinda want to order it now.",1
1305,1,5,9/28/2011,"This place is awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great prices, large portion, brick oven pizza is amazing !!! Service is wonderful this place is my favorite spot. great deal for 2 slices of pizza and a drink for 5 bucks !!!",1
1306,1,4,9/21/2011,"In search of the best pizza in NY I happened upon this place. Although it didn't turn out to be the holy grail of pizza, it was quite good none the less, thoroughly enjoyed it. Ordered half pepperoni and half alla vodka, soo good. Felt like an authentic brooklyn pizza shop too, great atmosphere.",1
1307,1,3,9/18/2011,"The pizza was fine, a little pricey. Â I don't know why people have gushed on here about the pizza, it was ok, not bad, not great or anything. Â I will stick with Pinos.",1
1308,1,4,9/11/2011,"Ordered the Antipasto, Bruschette, and a small Margharita pie with sausage. Â Bruschette - Fantastic, though I do usually prefer slightly more crunchy bread, it was still great with excellent ingredients on top. Â Antipasto - Also very good. Â Very fresh mozzarella and tomato, delicious roasted pepper, sundried tomato, olives and some fantastic baked flatbread. Â My only critique is the artichoke hearts need to be better seasoned or use a different brand perhaps. Â Pizza - Consistent with the rest of the meal - excellent, but not the best I've ever had (that would be in Italy though, so a hard comparison!). Â The sauce and cheese are fresh and I like the thin crust which is not too crunchy but not soggy. Â I wasn't amazed with the sausage, though I don't usually order that - my wife wanted it, though neither of us liked it all that much. Â Still, a great pizza.",1
1309,1,4,9/6/2011,"Came up here to Brooklyn, which is really ""home"" but now living in DC...so the 1st order of business as we drive into NY is head over to Brooklyn to get some pies! Peppinos was the closest stop to where we were so be it. We hit the jack pot as Peppinos delivered in every way to satisfying my need for awesome NY Pizza's I took my first bite of the Garlic crisps ""WOW"" I realized what I have been missing down in DC. The crisps are fantastic but save room for the real meal. We ordered a Margherita and a Diavola. My kids, my wife...we loved every bite. The ingredients were fresh, the crust was perfect, the brick oven smell, taste...fantastic. The service was great here too, nice smiles and attentive. I cannot wait to come back to Peppinos when I am back in town...this place is a must try in the arsenal of NY Pizza places....",1
1310,1,3,9/4/2011,"Stopped at Peppinos for pizza this evening. Â Times like this, I wish Yelp would institute a 1/2 star scale because I would really like to give Peppinos a 3.5 star. Â However, since I can't (get the hint Yelp), I feel Peppinos is closer to a 3 star than a 4 star. For starters, the pizza here is very good - just not the best I've had in town. Â I had a 4 topping pizza with mushrooms, olives sausage and pepperoni. Â Price wise, I thought Peppinos was a little on the high side (the pizza was $25.00). Â Also, the portions are not overly large. Now that I've been critical, here's some of the finer points... Â B wait at all (always a plus). Â Also, the menu does have lots of choices including sandwiches, salads and pasta.",1
1311,1,4,8/29/2011,"So so so good. The pizza was very well done - cheese, toppings, and the like were all exquisite! Crust just the right thickness (I like it when pizza crust is a little thinner). Fresh mozzarella cheese. Pepperoni to die for. Too bad I was just here staying with a friend - I would most definitely order from them in the future. A must in Park Slope, seriously. I know good pizza when I see it.",1
1312,1,5,8/24/2011,holly pie Batman! Â (sorry...the Super Hero Supply shop is only blocks away) These guys cut no corners on the quality of their ingredients. Â Toss in brick oven goodness and you've got one heck of a pizza. Â Each slice was structured and layered with beauty and solid in the taste dept (quatro staggioni). Â I strongly recommend this place.,1
1313,1,2,8/19/2011,"Pizza (quatro staggioni) = solid. Â Good ingredients: Â veggies were fresh, sauce was seasoned but didn't overpower the tomatoes in the base Delivery = substandard. Â Called and was quoted a half hour delivery time, took just under an hour. Â Both the driver and the person who answered the phone when I called back were indifferent. Advice to Peppinos = Don't overpromise and you won't disappoint.",1
1314,1,5,8/10/2011,"So, the hubs and I ended up here after walking across the Brooklyn Bridge and seeing the ridiculous line at Grimaldi's. A quick train ride out to Park Slope brought us to Peppino's, and thank God it did. :) This place is fantastic. Definitely the best pizza I've ever had. We did a half vodka, half ham, artichoke and olive pizza. So ridiculously good. The crust was amazing. We also had some lobster bisque which was pretty good also. The service was great. If you're already trekking out to Brooklyn for pizza, skip the crazy wait at Grimaldi's and head to Peppino's instead.",1
1315,1,4,8/5/2011,"I really like Peppinos - though I do wish they had a more enticing reason for me to stop by more frequently. I live very, very close so I would like to take advantage of their great pizza more often; but unfortunately their really good pizzas are not sold by the slice. Â With Joe's pizza being right up the block I often opt for Joe's just for the sake of variety. Admittedly Peppinos has much higher quality in their regular menu but so many of us in the neighborhood are just picking up dinner for ourselves, and I think that Peppinos is designed to sit down with a family. Personally, I would like to see at least Â one of their specialty pizzas available by the slice daily.",1
1316,1,5,8/4/2011,"the exterior of peppino's might trick you into thinking it's just another dingy pizza joint in Brooklyn. Â don't be fooled. Â inside, you will find friendly and attentive wait staff, crispy brick-oven crust, spicy pepperoni, fresh bufala mozzarella, and the best homemade pasta fagioli i've ever tasted. Â go to peppino's now!!!",1
1317,1,5,7/30/2011,Amazing brick oven pizza delivered to your door. Take that grimaldi's,1
1318,1,4,7/17/2011,"My husband and I love Peppino's. Up until recently we lived just a few blocks away and it was our go-to place for really excellent brick oven pizza. We were fortunate to live with several excellent pizza options in the hood (Anthony's on 7th is good, and Toby's Public House has some mean pizza too and a dessert calzone to die for). Peppino's ended up winning out against other places though because they have a great selection and their pies don't get crazy expensive. If you love the crunchy chewy thin crust pizzas with fresh Â homemade sauce (not sweet), fresh mozzarela and excellent quality toppings, this is a go-to place. Have ordered extensively from their menu and it's all good. On top of all the great food, Carmela and the staff are always welcoming and friendly. Never seen anyone here have an off day. There are really amazing pizza places with a lot of hype and waits. Those places are still great to go to every so often but this was our everyday place. We always felt pretty lucky to live just a few blocks away. Now we live in Austin and will NEVER get this quality of pizza without a cross-country trek back to the neighborhood. I'll miss them.",1
1319,1,4,6/23/2011,"Okay, so order whole pies from this place and they are great! Single slices not as much so, but the whole pies, especially the "" Quattro Stagioni"" - tomato sauce, artichokes, black olives, ham, mushrooms & fresh mozzarella kick ass. Solid pizza if you're in the area, but I wouldn't travel too far for it...",1
1320,1,5,6/16/2011,My go to place in the neighborhood. Â Decently priced really really good pizza and cheap beer. Â Comfortable place to sit with friends. Â Just ordered it last night for dinner. Â The Margherita and Pizza Biaca are the best.,1

They pop into Campo de Fiori and chomp down on extremely-overpriced crappy gimmick pies while the real old Brooklyn gems are right under their noses. Peppinos has a good brick oven that burns hot enough to make a thin crust that's neither droopy nor brittle. It has good NYC tap water and skilled Brooklyn hands working the dough. The ambiance is bleh. The servers are generally 17 year olds from the local Catholic Girls Schools (cute but confused). It's not too expensive and it's far less full of itself than Grimaldi's (good God try getting in there on a fuckin tuesday, forget weekends), Lombardi's (Pompous ass clientele & over-rated pies) or even the real Brooklyn Rivals DiFara & Totonno's. Both of which are still kicking but I mean Dom ain't gettin any younger, a slice is now $6 (I shat myself when I saw that) and his place is over run with annoying yuppies congratulating themselves for taking the Q train past Grand Army Plaza for the first time...",1

I'm obseeeeeessed with Lombardi's, and with pizza in general lately, so I welcomed the challenger with open arms. We decided on the meatball pizza and started with a caprese and a caesar salad. The tomatoes and mozzarella were huge and pletiful and fresh and tasted great with a splash of balsamic vinegar. I know it seems so silly and simple, but it's easy to make a crappy and unsatisfying caesar salad and this one was the opposite. It was delicious and had the perfect amount of dressing. Our pizza was definitely good. Huge leaves of basil and thick slices of meatball and toasty crust. I personally wouldn't go so far as to say it was better than Lombardi's, but it definitely didn't disappoint. I should also point out that our server was incredibly sweet and attentive and personable. A great local pizza joint.",1

Â :P He was very polite, despite this, so we gave him a good tip. Â  But be careful, don't make any plans during the delivery time, or there's a good possibility you'll end up seeing them earlier than you expected. Food was good, too, if you're curious. Â :P",1

I've also had the fresh mozzarella hero, spinach ravioli and the eggplant parmagiana and they have all been great. Get the cold antipasto and/or some clams to start (the clams are CLEANED and taste authentic, this is important). Last time i went they also gave complimentary mini foccaccia. Â  Lastly, the pizza is awesome! You can get 6 or 8 slice pies and they come in a bunch of different varieties.

Delivery took less time than grub hub indicated. About 30 mins. Â Delivered fresh and piping hot to my door all for $20. That includes the tip. All that yummy goodness with and a bottle of white wine = awesome dinner.",1

It reminds me of the crust at John's Best (for anyone who knows that secret gem up in Mount Kisko). But what makes me love this neighborhood classic more than anything is the excellent service, friendly staff and family atmosphere (although we usually order in cause we live up street). I consider myself blessed for living near the best pizzeria in town!",1

The service was amazing- the waitress and the busboy were attentive and polite. Â The place is also just really homey and comfy on a early winter night. Â While waiting for the bathroom, I admired all the children's drawing on the wall. Â You know when a kid draws a picture of pizza and he or she writes ""I LOVE YOU"" they ain't lying. Â  Go get some!",1

It was a bit a of a hike from BBG, but the reviews were so good on Yelp that we had to try it. We ordered the fried ravioli appetizer and they were delicious. Next up a small Margherita Pizza. Bleh. The ingredients were good, but the dough was burnt despite being spongy and not crispy at all. I've read reviews where the pizza was crisp and delicious so they must have problems with consistency. The service was awesome, and everyone was very friendly. My drink was never empty, which was good on a hot day where we had done a lot of walking. If I'm in the area again, I may give it another try, but I wouldn't go too far out of my way.",1
1343,1,5,7/19/2010,"Oh hell yes. Despite a low-end looking exterior, Peppino's makes a delicious, yet affordable, gourmet pie. The margherita is perfect - fresh basil, quality cheese, tangy sauce, chewy crust. Delivery is prompt, the person taking the orders is polite, and even strolling in and ordering a pie To Go doesn't result in an interminable wait. Can't speak to the dining-in experience - I abhor bright lights in restaurants and this place is lit up like an operating room so I've stuck to delivery and takeout. A great go-to pizza place. I hope they stay open forever and a day.",1

The waitress was very attentive and friendly. The layout is kind of typical Italian style restaurant, plaid tablecloth, the decor was kinda weird, too much going on, you have a picture of Marilyn Monroe, the Brooklyn Bridge, a crucifix's, a picture of St. Pio, it was too much.

1346,1,5,5/12/2010,"It's a local pizza place with great brick oven pizza. The atmosphere is comfortable and it feels like a family-run joint. It's bright inside, so it might not be a great place for a first date. But, if you live nearby, this should be your go-to pizza place. Also: the cheesesteaks here are delicious.",1
1347,1,5,4/29/2010,"My Italian friend, Sal, from Brooklyn asked me what I wanted to eat while I was in town visiting for the weekend. Â Two things came to mind--cannolis, and brick-oven-fired pizza from a legit pizzeria. Â Sal took me here after a long day in the city to get some dinner. Â We shared a large margherita pizza with italian sausage ('cause I like my meat, but also love a traditional margherita) and a shrimp oreganata served with linguini in a garlic-olive oil sauce. Â The pizza was to die for! Â You honestly can't get anything like that here on the west coast. Â The linguini was meh--a little bland for my taste, but the shrimp was covered in this delicious rub rich in spices--I could easily imagine myself having an entire bucket of these while watching tv. ...Then we went took the F line back to Sal's place so I could have two more cannolis before heading to bed. Â Mission accomplished",1
1348,1,5,4/6/2010,"mmmmm delishh!!!...staff is very attentive and friendly, food is made fresh with much care...its not ur ordinary pizza spot, its a very cozy sit down resturant, with great choices...loved it here...will come back!",1
1349,1,3,3/26/2010,"Pretty good -- and certainly a great option for non-NY style pizza in the South Slope. Nothing to travel for, though. I found the plain pizza to be undersalted and the beer selection isn't so hot. Eh.",1
1350,1,4,3/15/2010,"Great brick oven pizza...and even better is that they make whole wheat crust! I suggest the whole wheat pie with spinach. Only down side is they don't make a lot of it, so on a busy night, it can be hit or miss if they have it.",1
1351,1,4,3/12/2010,"This place has great pizza, good sandwiches and the wait staff is always REALLY nice. Â Last time we were there they gave us free bruschetta for the hell of it... oh and they have $3 Peroni!",1
1352,1,4,3/10/2010,Great sauce. Plain pizza is terrific. No broccoli though :( Also great chicken parm and the bread is fantastic!,1
1353,1,3,2/26/2010,"Its hard to impress me food wise so I only give this place 3 stars for now. I went for the first time yesterday since it was in the neighborhood and I decided to take a walk in the snow storm. I ordered a seafood salad, pasta fagioli soup and a margarita pizza with sausage. I am not a pig, I was with my boyfriend and we shared it all. LOL. Â  The seafood salad was really good but I could have done without the pitted olives. I love olives, just not pitted. The soup was sort of bland but could have been because my mouth was tainted with the oil and spices of the seafood salad. The pizza came out and it was thin which is good to me. The sausage was thinly sliced too. Service was good but we were one of three tables there so if service wasn't good, shame on them. I would go back to Peppino's to try other food on the menu but I like La Villa better so far.",1
1354,1,1,1/26/2010,Overpriced and mediocre.The Pizza Â was burnt on the bottom. and the flavor were sub par. I ordered the veggie pie and the Margarita pizza. $43.90. This is Pizza not caviar. Next..,1
1355,1,4,1/8/2010,"This is a very nice time; I'd say hit the bruschetta for the appetizer, & get a pizza & a pasta dish for the dinner (I mean, assuming you go in a group of around 3-4; you might want more or less depending). Â Plus-- Peroni is basically only good at places like this. Â Get a draught!",1
1356,1,5,12/31/2009,My favorite pizza in Park Slope. All their sandwiches are delicious. The meatball parm is a favorite. The staff is extremely friendly.,1
1357,1,3,10/10/2009,"The meatball roll was great, but the brick oven pizza didn't hold up well enough for delivery.",1
1358,1,5,9/29/2009,Incredible pizza... Â crispy crust/delicious toppings and pretty much the friendliest service imaginable. Â We ordered four pizzas to take out and they gave us free bottles of soda and free drinks while we waited. Â We felt like family.,1
1359,1,4,9/7/2009,"We've continued to go to Peppinos and keep find ourselves there because we like it so much. Last night we had a great arugula, red onion and cherry tomato pizza. The service is always friendly and there's always space for us. Pros: Good, friendly service, delicious pizza Cons: Oddly enough, my son hates the tablecloths and always has (he's 5) : )",1
1360,1,4,7/14/2009,"Not your average neighborhood pizza dive! Ranks with some of the city's thin-crust pantheons, both old and noveau. Fantastic calzones, too. BEWARE, does not travel well--not recommended for delivery unless you're pretty close by.",1
1361,1,4,7/8/2009,"A few of the other local delivery places raised their prices and lowered quality, Peppino's website informs they just reduced prices (slightly). If I'm craving traditional Brooklyn plain slice, I'll order from somewhere else, but this is my new default pizza delivery. The cheese steak wasn't bad either.",1
1362,1,4,6/27/2009,"Came here on Thursday for dinner with my parents who were in town. I chose Peppinos because I read a lot of good reviews and it certainly held up to it's reputation. Even with a group of 30 that was piling in when we arrived, the waiters were very attentive and pleasant. We ordered the garlic crisps as an appetizer and shared a large margherita pizza with pepperoni. I absolutely loved the fresh mozzarella on the pizza and the slices actually had substance unlike the flat-as-a-pancake slices I find everywhere in the city.",1
1363,1,5,6/21/2009,"Love it! Â  Had the ""Pizza Bianca"" or something like that. Â White pizza. Â Best I've had in the city. Also a neat looking old timey phone booth",1
1364,1,4,6/16/2009,"Ok...I love bread...hence I love deep dish pizza's. Â It also doesn't help that all my family lives in Chicago. Â The thicker the crust, the better. Â I even named my dog Gino after ""Gino's East Pizza"" in Chicago. Â I stopped by Peppino's, ordered a mozzarella/tomato, sausage, and a mushroom pizza and thought they were pretty darn good. Â The two guys that were working were super friendly. Â Coming from Hawaii, this was my first taste of New York style pizza and it was pretty good. Â Will I convert? Â Maybe...since I hold no loyalties to either city. Â I would return if I didn't have to struggle for parking. Â  If you ask me, I'd prefer a Hawaiian pizza for obvious reasons...",1
1365,1,5,5/12/2009,"Friggin' good!!! Â The crust is THE perfect paradigm of crisp, light chewiness. Â And the proportion of cheese to topping to sauce was well balanced (I had margarehita w/pepperoni). Â  Maybe could have used a bit more basil, but really just a minor offense. Â  Â  Casual and comfortable, but very clean and attentive waitstaff. Â  So happy to find good pizza in the neighborhood...tried some other ""must-haves"" and utterly disappointed.",1
1366,1,5,4/23/2009,"Peppino's is my new neighborhood love for 2 reasons - the brick oven is the bomb and the staff is super friendly and polite. You seriously feel like you are eating over at a friend's house and their ""recession special' is perfect - 2 slices (any kind) and a soda for $5 or maybe it's $6, I can't really remember. All I know is that I stopped by for lunch with a former east coaster craving good pizza, we both got 2 slices and a soda, caught up on old times for 2 hours, were never rushed to leave and only paid $12! Â  The staff is so welcoming. Â Even if it's your first time there you feel like a part of the family. Â  Enjoy!",1
1367,1,5,4/11/2009,I love when you go back again that the experience is just as amazing as the first time! We had the sausage pizza with tomato sauce and I loved that it wasn't too acidy. I love that they're fast and pleasant - this is my favorite and can't wait to try more of their pizzas!,1
1368,1,5,3/29/2009,"Decided on a whim to go to Peppino's with my roommates for a casual Sunday night dinner and boy am I glad we did! The ambiance was exactly what we were looking for - your typical neighborhood pizza place. Very clean, casual, and the waitstaff was very friendly- we felt right at home. Â  Our pizza was delicious - we ordered a large grilled chicken pie. The cherry tomatoes on it melted in your mouth and were perfectly complimented by mushrooms and of course, grilled chicken. We were also very impressed by the variety on the menu. I'll definitely be back to try a pasta dish. All in all a great choice!",1
1369,1,5,3/21/2009,"Peppino's was a very pleasant surprise. We went there, honestly, because it was chilly and we were too lazy to go out to Di Fara. Â We wanted pizza, but something good - not the normal crap that passes for a pie in the Slope. Â When we decided against Di Fara, my next thought was Franny's - where else? Â But that would've still ended up being a hike for us, and so we figured, no something closer. We had passed Peppino's several times and it looked inviting, but the prices were a bit off-putting - $17 for a margherita pie isn't outrageous for brick oven, but we've got kids, and these days every buck counts. Â Still, we wanted something better than the usual fare, so we headed on down. We ordered a margherita but asked for some ricotta on it, and the mozzarella and tomato plate to start. Â The mozzarella and tomato plate was uninspiring, fairly normal, but that's not a bad thing. The pizza itself was quite good - and surprisingly large. Â Most of these brick oven places charge you twice what a normal pie runs and gives you something around the size of a frisbee and expect you to be blown away. Â (Franny's is guilty of this, for instance, although the obvious art and effort that goes into their pies mostly makes up for it.) Â This one, though, was full sized - and made with fresh mozzarella and herbed ricotta. Â For that price, it was excellent. Â The sauce was the best part - one of the best pizza sauces we've had in a while. Â The crust was crisp on the edges, soft on the inside, firm and thick enough to hold the pizza together but not so thick that you feel like you're eating a piece of bread with sauce and cheese on top. Â The only real downside was that there was actually too much cheese - we wish we had asked for extra sauce, or maybe a small cup of it on the side to dip into. The waiter also brought out - gratis - a mini pie, half margherita, half calzone, for us to try. Â I'm not quite sure why - maybe because we had asked for ricotta on our pie, which is basically a different incarnation of the pie we got. Â We weren't objecting. The service was a little distracted but very friendly, and very tolerant of our girls, who were feeling especially rambunctious. Â They have kids drawings taped all over one of the walls, and everyone was smiling as they worked. Â The decor was a little off - I think they weren't quite sure if they were upscale brick oven, local neighborhood joint, family-run establishment... it looked like a mix of all of the above. Overall, I'd recommend them pretty highly. Â The prices were very affordable, and the pies very satisfying. Â They aren't the best in the world, but in Park Slope? Â Pretty close to it.",1
1370,1,5,3/14/2009,"As a resident of South Park Slope, I think I would have to move away if my neighborhood ever lost Peppino's. Â What might seem like a slightly-above-average pizzeria/italian restaurant is actually a diamond in the rough. Â  From my personal fav Grilled Chicken Italiano Sandwich, to my other fav Putanesca Pizza, Peppino's just makes things that taste GREAT. Â  It might be the brick oven, it might be the unique sauce they use, or the fresh mozarella cheese, but whatever it is, I am addicted. Â The go-to place for myself, my wife, or any visitor we have to the area, Peppino's is the spot.",1
1371,1,4,1/27/2009,"I've eaten here three times and I love it. I've only ever had the regular cheese slices but they're awesome. The cheese is gooey and the brick-oven gives the crust a nice smoky flavor. I only wish the slices were crispier, they are a little too floppy for my liking. Get the recession special, it's two slices and a soda for $5.",1
1372,1,4,1/25/2009,"Just had Peppino's for the first time, I'm ashamed to say. I've lived right next door to the place and have never been over there until tonight, but it was really good pizza. I had a pizza with tomato sauce, garlic, basil and capers (no cheese) and it was awesome.. can't wait to try the others. I got the small, which is 6 slices and I usually can put away a lot of food (see photo) but only ate half, all for $10. I will be stopping in for a full dinner one of these nights instead of just getting to go food - looked cool inside and a great neighborhood spot.",1
1373,1,4,1/7/2009,"They have a nice little computer set-up where it knows your number via caller ID, then pulls up your address. I just moved and to reward my helpers, I ordered some pizza. When they supplied my old address, I told them I had just moved that day. The man on the phone congratulated me and took the new address. When delivery came, Peppino's sent over 2 two-liters of soda on the house. Thanks guys!",1
1374,1,4,12/28/2008,"Really tasty brick oven pizza with a delicious sauce. Â I also love their sausage and peppers hero, though part of what I loved about it was that it was served on almost pizza dough-like bread. Â The last time I ordered it, excited for its deliciousness, it showed up on a normal hero. Â I was really disappointed. Â That said, it was still damn good... just not as good. Â Next time I'll call and explicitly ask about the bread. Their margarita and diavolo pizzas are both amazing. Â I only wish I didn't get my weekly Peppino's hankerings consistently on Monday, the one day of the week that they're closed.",1
1375,1,5,12/27/2008,"Last weekend I ordered a margarita pie and the delivery guy brought two for me because they'd over cooked the crust on the first one (still delicious despite being extra crisp). I was so impressed that they gave me both and I had lunch for the next day...added bonus. Their brick oven gives the pizza a slight smoky flavor absent from most pizzas, setting it apart from the pack. The crust is wonderfully thin, toppings are plentiful and fresh. The pizza is perfect typical NY-style, great for folding. Yummmmmmmmm...",1
1376,1,5,12/23/2008,"I eat here sooooooooo much. Â And it's not because I am lazy and it is only a few blocks from my place. Â If you are in the mood for Italian Peppino's gives you so many options. Â Their Brick oven pie is the best I have ever had. Â I have done the Grimaldi's and Lombardi's and I feel this pie trumps it. Â Two pies in particular Pizza alla Vodka and the Diavola. Â The ingredients are always very fresh and they cook the pie correctly so it is not flimzy. Â  Than there are the Heros. Â The Chicken parm and Meatball parm are phenomenal. Â The tomato sauce tastes like an old family recipe and we are lucky enough to enjoy it. Â Also I think Pepinos is the only restaurant with this type of hero bread and they toast it in the brick oven too. The last thing I have had is the raviolis and you really can't go wrong with this. Â Great sauce, fresh, and a good helping. I swear I am not a promoter for Peppino's but if you are in the slope do yourself a favor and don't wait in line for Grimaldi's sit down and enjoy a pie at Peppino's",1

1378,1,3,10/26/2008,"...despite a bad review I previously posted, I made another trip out here and was delightfully surprised. The service was friendly and inviting as were the pizza's. Thin crust was a bit soggy, but the flavors played in my mouth like a perfect concerto that would make any Salieri wannabe jealous. Brick oven and a family environment add great touches but the real hero is the pizzas. I'll make another trip out to try their pastas...to be continued",1
1379,1,4,10/17/2008,"We LOVE this place. They have quite a few yummy pizza selections and the thin crispy crust ...makes my mouth water just thinking about it. It is expensive, yes, for a pie, but the taste makes it worthwhile.",1
1380,1,5,10/10/2008,"I just finished the ""Recession Special,"" a lunchtime deal of two slices and a drink (root beer in my case) for $5. I hadn't done my research in advance, so I was expecting just an average streetside pizza place. Not the case. The pizza was amazing--thin crust, crisp at the edges and chewy in the center, with the perfect smattering of black freckles on the bottom from the fiery brick oven. Just the right amount of cheese and sauce with a lot of real tomatoes, basil and oregano. Peppino's blows Joe's Pizza (a block south) completely out of the water. Service was quick and friendly, and it's only a block from my home/office and a few more from Prospect Park, which meant work picnic. This place is likely to become a dangerous lunchtime habit, at least as long as the recession lasts. I haven't been for dinner or a full pie, and it seems like the prices are pretty steep, so I'll stick to lunch for now.",1
1381,1,4,10/2/2008,"Really delicious brick oven pizza. I've ordered delivery, and it came piping hot and in a super timely fashion. At the restaurant, service was great and super accommodating, plus we got warm, fluffy bread which is always appreciated. Only downside: the pizza is hella expensive; definitely not what your average ""pizza night"" would cost.",1
1382,1,3,9/10/2008,"I haven't eaten in yet, but delivery wasn't great. Â It tasted a little stale and bland. Â It tasted like it could have been good if I ate it straight out of the oven though. Â It's also pretty expensive... $15 for a small 6 slice pie.",1
1383,1,5,8/4/2008,"I'm torn about writing this review: on the one hand, I don't want word to get out that Peppino's is great, and make it all crowded. On the other hand, I think business is currently a little slow, and and I don't want the best pizza in Park Slope to go under. The pizza and sandwiches are both great. Dough is homemade, chewy, with a nice crispiness to the crust (obviously, it suffers a little in delivery, as all high-end pizza does. We ask for ours well-done when delivering). Most sandwiches come on bread made from the same dough as the pizza. Sauce is flavorful, chunky, well-spiced, and not at all sweet, which I hate. Cheese is very good, with actual flavor, as opposed to the rubbery fatwads lots of pizza places use. Toppings are high-quality, and they don't skimp. Is this the best pizza in New York? No. Is it the best pizza in Park Slope? Definitely. I hope you agree: just don't be sitting in my seat when I get there. : )",1
1384,1,3,7/16/2008,"Went on a Tuesday night around 7pm. Â We were the only diners besides one lonely guy sitting at one of the tables. Â It didn't deter us from giving this place a try. Â It's super clean in there with decent decor, which is a plus. Â The waitress was also super friendly, another plus. Â We ordered a small margherita pizza and one cheese steak to share. Â  The pizza was bleh, the main reason for the lower star rating. Â I definitely would not order pizza from here again. Â The crust was burned on the bottom but it wasn't crisp. Â The sauce didn't have enough flavor and the cheese tasted a bit rubbery. Â  The cheesesteak was the highlight though. Â Great flavor with a great hero bread. Â I might go back for the cheesesteak, since I'm in the area a lot. Â You still can't beat 99 miles to philly for a good cheesesteak found in NY though!",1

1386,3,2,3/12/2014,"Food is creative and thought provoking - but make sure you eat before you go. Â Portions are ridiculously small and left me feeling short-changed and hungry. Â Had the celery oyster stew. Â I know it's Brooklyn, but since when did potato and oyster cracker filler cost this much? Â The stew scarcely covered the bottom of a cavernous bowl. Â Conversation throughout dinner tended to echo off the exposed sides of said bowl. Heard every story twice. Â Dekalb, maybe focus less on furbishing the walls of your restaurant, and more on furbishing the walls of my bowl of cheap-ingredient-yet-fancy-named-stew. Â Probably won't be a next time. P.S.

1388,3,5,4/22/2014,"I was in Brooklyn last weekend visiting family and we decided to try the relatively new Dekalb's Restaurant in Brooklyn, New York. Â What a treat! Â The menu is filled with dishes that are creative, economical, healthy, and most importantly delicious. Â The wait staff was fabulous, especially Jamie, our waitress. Â She was not just pleasant; she understood what was in each dish and gave us great advice about what to order to fill all of our different needs. Â (We were a group of carnivores and Â vegetarians. There were great choices for everyone. ) There was live music on Saturday night- and the way the restaurant is set up, we could hear the music, but it never got in the way of our conversation. We first went there for dinner, and wound up going back for brunch the next morning. Â We never do that when in New York, but we had so much fun and the menu was so innovative, we could not help ourselves.",-1
1389,3,5,4/22/2014,The decor is so lovely and the menu fantastic. I especially loved the cocktail menu and the friendly bar crowd. The bartender helped us talk to everyone at the bar and really nerd-out about cocktails and specialty liquors. It was a really fun evening.,-1

The only recommendation I would have is that the seats are uncomfortable (although they look really cool) and could use some cushions. I am dumbfounded that another reviewer didn't like the veggie burger! I would say it is one of the best I have ever tasted... and I know veggie burgers.",-1
1392,3,5,2/23/2014,"I can't articulate enough how impressed we are with the food at this new establishment. I have found myself craving every dish I have consumed here the moment I have another opportunity to eat. Therefore we ate dinner their last night and then again today for brunch. The food is not the only aspect of this restaurant to gush over, the staff is warm, friendly, attentive and incredibly capable. The atmosphere is inviting and relaxed. The decor accentuates the environment with its reclaimed and repurposed materials. The beauty is in the details and their are so many beautifully executed details that you can feel the hard work and love that was poured into the place by the owners. Â  The food is the stand out, the executive chef really knows how to put a perfectly composed dish in front of you. The lamb was fork tender, paired with potatoes that were cooked lightly enough to still have the textural integrity needed to complement the silky lamb. The parsnip gnocchi, I prefer to call the parsnip pillows myself. Flawlessly toasted on the outside but light as air when you bite into them. The fried brussel sprouts are a must have, they have an indulgent quality about them that gets you thinking about the last time you ate a vegetable with such enthusiasm. The trout dish was exceptional, I don't often use the words ""rich and creamy"" to describe a fish dish but this one is the definition of rich and creamy. Peanuts boiled and pureed are the bed that an expertly broiled piece of trout sits a top. The skin of the trout is crisp and the delicate flaky white meat marry's together with the pureed peanuts in a refreshing and inventive take on your familiar seafood entree. The nice thing about the menu here is it's not a huge commitment. They have something that delights any mood or pallet you may be experiencing. The portions are appropriate to the cost which is so appreciated as a diner. You can easily share small plates or have just one entree and leave satiated. The current BYOB option gives you an opportunity to pair the food with what you acknowledge to be your preference in spirits. We have lived in this neighborhood for a number of years and are so pleased to see this new restaurant open in our area. With such quality food and comfortable environment its well on its way to becoming a staple in our daily routine.",-1
1393,3,5,1/27/2014,"I just moved to the area so I keep finding little things that really warms me up to my new home. Dekalb is certainly of those places a hidden gem. My friend and I were looking for places that would accommodate her special diet. Saw a sign for warm soup. From the outside look like all the other apartments near it just with a garage door not to far from the door making a slight difference. Well I'm glad they had that little sign up. We went in to find a warm place with warm colors of wood and the smell of fresh coffee just brewed greeting us with friendly people at the bar drinking from their coffee cups. A beautiful deity amazon woman with big hair greeted us and gracefully took us to a deeper area. A room completely made of windows ambient lightning and soulful music playing. I sat down on a church pew really feeling the sacredness of this place. We looked at the menu to find things that my friend could eat. I got the endive and she got the braised salsify to start. Then I got a almond stuffed trout and my friend got a vegetable burger. Followed by the parsnip yogurt dessert. The endive was savory and refreshing. I tasted the braised salsify assuming it would be salty but was happy to find a subtle sweetness. The almond trout was big enough for two people to eat but bc of this snow my appetite was large enough. The veggie burger she enjoyed saying she would come back for it again. The dessert was a masterpiece with the pyramid shape topped with a glass like caramel, a rare taste that wasn't overly sweet but just right. Got the check totaling $66 before the tip this had me and my friend nodding at each other yes we found our church of food. Usually food like this is easily $120-$160.",-1
1394,3,3,12/20/2014,"Came for brunch; considering giving it another shot. Very good food, awesome atmosphere--really, but sloppy service. Other reviewers got it right by commenting on the potential, and I too feel that it's really just missing taking itself seriously enough. Our table was given a mix of current and outdated menus, so our vegetarian friend ordered an omelette from the old menu and ended up getting the current omelette with lamb. Pretty serious mix-up. And apparently, from reading past reviews, not the first time this has happened. Hope management gets its shit together. I'd really like to come back once (or if ever) they iron out the wrinkles.",1
1395,3,4,12/8/2014,"Updated review~~~~~~~ I had an issue with pricing and delivery, and the manager has since gone out of her way to rectify everything. Restaurants that go out of their way to make a customer feel welcomed back and fully satisfied is a sure fire way for the restaurant to make it in this city. I will definitely be ordering food from this place again now. Thank you for taking care of your patrons! Original review~~~~~~~~~ I ordered food for delivery for a second time to see if the other items were as good as the first time I ordered. I used Seamless to make the ordering easier, and that turned out not to be the case. I ordered the Banana Polenta Fries which are $8. I got a call from the restaurant shortly after placing my order, informing me that they were out of that and asked what I would like to replace it with. I asked Â what else they had for the same price, and was told lots of items that were less, but nothing for the same price or even more. Finally I was told that the bread pudding was the same price, so that is what I ordered. Turned out, it was actually $3 cheaper, but my order was never revised and I was charged the more expensive price. When something like that happens at other restaurants, they normally offer an item that is the same $ or more. Never, and I mean NEVER, have I been offered food that is less $, and then charged for the pricier item. That alone is bad business practice. unfortunately that is not the only bad part of the order. The delivery guy called me from outside my building telling me to come down and get my food because he has a bike. Don't most food delivery guys ride bikes?Aren't they suppose to deliver food to the door, and not ask you to go outside to get your food because they have a bike? I'm upset about both items above, but charging me more $ for a cheaper item is extremely bad business.",1
1396,3,3,11/22/2014,"The decor and playlist were a cool. The food is good. The service however is seriously lacking. Over 20 minutes to get draught beer when there are only a few tables full? I really don't get it. Almost an hour to get our food, again it was relatively empty and another table that arrived well after we did got their food first.",1
1397,3,5,11/9/2014,"I saw this place on a walk to the Home Depot- was intrigued by the beautiful exterior. Returned later for dinner with my boyfriend. Staff was super friendly and the atmosphere was fabulous. We were both immediately charmed but also saddened by how most of the dining room was empty. We ordered from the small plates menu- the smoked trout, the pumpkin gnocchi and the brussel sprouts. All was delivered to our table promptly- fresh and delicious. The entire meal was punctuated by my boyfriend and I raving about how good everything was. Though we were full, we wanted to order more. So we'll definitely be back soon.",1
1398,3,4,11/8/2014,"Brunch, dinner, and drinks have all been amazing. I recommend the gnocchi, chickpea salad, sausage, eggs benedict, and coffee. I will agree with an earlier review about the service. All very friendly but kind of clueless. That won't keep me away but it's something to be worked on. Ask about the history about the decor. Very cool. Cocktails take awhile because the bartenders put their heart and soul into it. I admire the effort but it's not good during busy dinner shifts.",1
1399,3,4,10/4/2014,"Tasty food, stylish decor, friendly staff. I had the kimchi melt brunch. Came with home fries and small mixed greens. $9. It had good flavor and the portion was appropriate. Not too big but definitely filling. Will surely come back. This place is located maybe a block off the Nostrand/Bedford G stop. The neighborhood is actively changing, and there are plenty of nearby joints to check out (Dynaco, Black Swan, Project Parlour, Brooklyn Stoops, Colador Cafe) if you want to hop around.",1
1400,3,2,9/29/2014,"Meh... I really want to like it. The space is really beautiful and when we arrived for brunch there was a live guitarist. Music was a little loud for the echoing space but it was still nice. But the Eggs Benedict was so bland. For 12$ I don't expect brilliance but I would like to leave at least close to full and satisfied. It's been a long time since I've needed to add salt and pepper to a dish. If you are not going to plate your dishes in an interesting way, then I expect some amazing hollandaise that wins me over. I'll try again to support a new place but they need to find some inspiration and excitement. Take a look at Do or Dine (yelp.com/biz/do-or-dine-â€¦) THAT is what food should look like when it leaves the kitchen.",1
1401,3,3,9/7/2014,"I waited to review this place till the third time I came to give it more chances to impress me... But it continues to lack fundamentally important aspects of a successful restaurant. The three stars is for the quality of the food and beverage, which I would actually give five stars because the chef really knows what he's doing, truly excellent fare. But the food is the only thing that comes out in a timely fashion. In a virtually empty restaurant, the staff is scattered about making no attempts to look busy, and if you order a drink, alcoholic or not, you won't get it for at least twenty minutes, and if you order multiple drinks (ie: coffee and water and a house made beverage) you'll get them each ten minutes apart. The service is always with a smile, but I can't tell if any member of the staff has any sense of what is going on or what exactly defines his/her job. This place needs stronger management and a better trained and hospitably aware staff to give it that little push that it really needs. Tremendous potential here... Excellent menu, atmosphere is fantastic, the decor is interesting and reclaimed and perfect, but seriously lacking attention to detail in all aspects of service.",1
1402,3,5,9/3/2014,"Went here for the second time. The first time I just had French fries, which were amazing. The second time, I ordered the lamb, chilled corn soup, and bread pudding. What an amazing meal. The soup was sweet with home made sour cream that tasted like heaven. The lamb was to die for. It sat on a bed of bok choi along with apricot sauce. One of the best meals I have had in a long time. I had two different bread puddings and they were warm and crunchy on the outside with cream on top. I also had some of their sparkling wine. The place is very clean and inviting. The servers are very courteous and attentive. It is definitely a diamond in the rough. I would highly recommend it and many compliments to their amazing chef, Damian.",1
1403,3,3,8/30/2014,"1) brunch food was good quality. Spouse had eggs Benedict and said the hollandaise sauce was good. I had the frittata -it was pretty flavorful. 2) bottomless drinks were a fail. This is why I give them 3 stars. Bloody Mary's are awful. Basically v8 and vodka. They tried to add spice - it did nothing. No kick. Nada. Go to Maggie browns or head into ft greene/Clinton hill. I asked for a mimosa since I couldn't bare the thought of another BM - they said that wasn't allowed?! Same price. Â Both bottomless?? Eventually they gave me the mimosa. 3) the vibe is very Williamsburg. Service was nonchalant and blasÃ©. Seemed like employees were predominantly transplants and out of towners who were too sensitive to direct questions that are commonplace in NYC . 4) Country music was playing. 5) Due to 2-4 above, will most likely not return. Sad because we just bought our first home very close to dekalb. Olea remains as ""our local spot"".",1
1404,3,2,8/16/2014,"Kind of a bummer. As the only game in town (immediate area) I had high hopes for Dekalb Restaurant, especially since at first glance it's a really beautiful space. The front room is what sells you: open and airy, big communal dining table, well kept bar. It feels very welcoming, like a European cafe. The main seating area is a bit drab since it's in the back of the restaurant with much less natural light. The service was average at best. The bartender glanced at us when we walked in and then ignored us until the servers reappeared. They were training a waitress when we visited, which is fine, but neither the trainer nor the trainee had much gusto and when I asked what the happy hour wine was they both seemed totally thrown for an answer beyond there being a ""red"" and a ""white"". Which brings me to the food, which was probably the biggest let down. The happy hour is a bit lame, $1 off two house wines and their beers, none of which I was terribly interested in. We came for dinner and ordered the gnocchi and the veggie burger. The gnocchi is a significantly smaller portion than other entrees and the flavors were confused and bland. There was what appeared to be deli mustard in the gnocchi sauce, which in addition to the gigantic slab of tough and chewy mushroom on the plate, was really not working. The veggie burger was gray, mushy, and flavorless. They also have no mayonnaise, which the burger really could have used and is in general just a little weird right? I would maybe give it another try for a drink or small bite, mostly just because sitting at the front communal table seems like it would be pleasant. Unfortunately, not interested in another dinner.",1
1405,3,5,8/6/2014,Excellent atmosphere. Unique and flavorful menu. Wonderful open air dining. Live music and exotic cocktails.,1
1406,3,5,8/4/2014,"Always a good time at Dekalb. The food is made with love and never makes you feel heavy. Also, Jamie is quite the baker and she can make vegan anything tastes amazing. Also, on the weekends you can find live music. The veggie burger is a big meal. I like the soup as well. Â  They used to have string bean tempura, that was heavenly. Check them out. Stephan the owner is super nice and you can find him sitting on his laptop in the front sometimes. His dad Mark is there sometimes too. He makes good drinks and knows his stuff. The drinks are hangover free :)",1
1407,3,5,8/2/2014,"Delicious food and wonderful atmosphere. They could have filled the place with tables but instead opted to leave the front more open with one big dining table and room for piano and dancing The hostess said they do reggae dance parties on Sunday 3-10pm The food: Â  Great flavor, many options for solo eating or sharing - Â  Good value Wine options excellent too",1
1408,3,5,7/24/2014,"I give this place 5 stars because they made me feel like they wanted me to come here and to like my experience. The wait staff was warm and comforting. The menu selection is not vast, but all the stuff seems good and interesting. I didn't try everything but it's got LOVE written all over it. It's a good place.",1
1409,3,3,7/24/2014,"Overall it's a nice restaurant. Cool atmosphere, interesting menu, nice addition to the neighborhood in terms of variety of cuisine, but the food was lacking. Many of the reviews here convinced me to visit right away, but I left feeling pretty disappointed. My date and I ordered the Asparagus Terrine, Gnocchi appetizer, french fries, and Lamb Tatsoi w/ apricot. The ingredients were definitely fresh, but needed a lot more seasoning. Overall the meal tasted very bland and we had to rely on the black pepper to liven up the dishes a bit. I understand that it's good to use salt sparingly, but the lack thereof really made these dishes extremely underwhelming. If this was the bland Midwest, I would have understood the lack of spices and flavor, but not NYC of all places. Also, from the pictures that I saw here on Yelp, the lamb dish used to come with brussel sprouts and parsney chips... Other times kale and a ragu. What I had last night was braised (more like pulled lamb) on a bed of fresh spinach with ONLY ONE pickled onion and a dab of apricot puree. Pretty boring. The server was nice and pretty helpful, but there was a guy playing the most annoying things on the piano before finally getting into ""enjoyable"" melodies 45 minutes into whatever practice session he was on. Not entirely sold on this place. I feel like this type of cuisine might be better appreciated by others, but just didn't do it for me or date at all.",1
1410,3,5,7/20/2014,Service? Yes. Food? Yes. Ambiance? Yes. Affordable? Yes. Just read a few reviews and went there to find this out. This place is a bit new and all I can hope is they keep their realness. Follow Brooklyn Food Porn on IG for more suggestions and check out this article on them. bkreader.com/2014/02/newâ€¦,1
1411,3,4,6/26/2014,"A new entry to a rapidly changing area of BedStuy, this restaurant is a patchwork of diverse materials and artifacts rescued from many locations around NYC. Interesting, unique decor. The service is friendly, the waitress was cheerful, warm, and very welcoming. The food was delicious, with generous portions of fries with my meal (I ordered the veggie sandwich with a slice of lamb on it). I had to knock one star off for the small menu selection. Hopefully the menu will grow and offer more items, but for now it's very limited. Also, they could do better with the lighting, especially in the table areas towards the rear. The lighting was a tad too dim and kind of depressing. Some warmer glows would help the ambiance alot. Overall, a nice place to go to when you're in the area and a welcome addition to the neighborhood.",1
1412,3,4,6/14/2014,"Adorable, chill place w live reggae band saturday night. Service was good though we went when it was pretty empty. Though menu was somewhat limited and a lil' pricey, both entrees were tasty. They were helpful in recommending and accommodating to my food intolerance/sensitivity. 1. Veggie burger w leeks and pickled onion jam 2. Gnocchi w mushroom",1
1413,3,4,6/14/2014,"This restaurant is a fun and unique find. We went for a walk one evening and came across this place. The decor is pretty amazing, the food selection is incredibly unique and delicious. They have a decent selection of beer but a great bar for mixed drinks and wine. Highly recommend for a date night or evening out.",1
1414,3,1,6/11/2014,"Only place in Brooklyn I have been and not welcomed, recommend no one to go. Food is so so.",1
1415,3,3,6/6/2014,"So I have a bunch to say about this place...but first a disclaimer: as a native Brooklynite I have been exposed to so many restaurants come and go in this borough, I realize that I have become a bit of an elitist foodie (but only for Brooklyn dining). So please take my comments with a grain of salt: 1. The food really is good. We had the Parmesan sticks that we more like knishes without potato; the gnocchi, and the monk fish. Solid dishes! 2. The ambiance is real chill, filled with refurbished wood, steel windows from an asylum, and parquet floors. 3. But the service is a hot mess!!! The menu is not clearly divided up into apps/ small plates and entrees- you have to infer this info in the price; waitresses aren't able to speak to items on the menu in order to make recommendations; food is not timed to come out at the right times, so you are eating at the same time as your friends; way too many people work in the space and they just all step over each other and interrupt your dinner. It's a good space and I wish them luck, but I don't plan to go back until a few months pass and they figure their shit out- especially for the price they are asking you to pay for their carelessness.",1
1416,3,3,6/6/2014,"Very good food. Very creative and fresh. I had the veggie burger with lamb (definitely get it with the lamb if you are not vegetarian), and the FiancÃ© had the gnocchi. Gnocchi is definitely hand made and very rustic in taste. Sadly had to knock off 2 stars because of service. Don't get me wrong, everyone is VERY nice, but they all appear to be novices in the service industry. Waitress actually took my order and then ran off, forgetting to take my date's order along with mine. They just need to tone up their service skills a little and run a tighter ship. They should start with the pacing of food. Our food came out in 5 minutes. We barely had time to sip our first drinks, and as a result, did not feel the need to order a 2nd round. Generally a very nervous and confused energy coming from the wait staff. My wish for this place is that they become cool and suave with their service, making me feel like I want to spend $20 on an entree and sit and drink for awhile. It seems they are trying to be a fine dining experience in Bedtsuy, and they have the food and decor to back it up, but not the service skills.",1
1417,3,5,6/6/2014,"Absolutely die for this spot. Had the pleasure of sharing drinks with Mark (owner/consultant) on several occasions. I wandered in off the street on my first visit and felt transported to a Caribbean dream. The entire restaurant was decorated by Mark, himself, and contains pieces over a century old. Great music, people and oh yes, the food! Words won't do justice, you must go and order the menu for yourself. Live reggae, home made syrups and sodas and a backyard garden. This restaurant epitomizes why Brooklyn is the epicenter of our culture today. Go to Dekalb and feel at home in a place right out of a destination. Cheers.",1
1418,3,5,6/4/2014,Dined last Saturday at this lovely restaurant. Â Very pretty inside with lots of authentic design ideas.

1419,3,4,5/20/2014,"I went to Dekalb Restaurant for Sunday Brunch with a large party and I was very happy with the total experience. Â The design and dÃ©cor of the restaurant is comfortable and appealing. Â We really enjoyed the live music which was not too loud, as has been my experience in other restaurants, especially if you're sitting close to the performers. Â The price was very reasonable. Â Between eleven people we had about 8 different entrees. Â All of the food was presented attractively. Â Two of my daughters ordered the Eggs Benedict and one, who is a bit of an Eggs Benedict snob, felt that they were not properly cooked. Â In fact, she reviewed the restaurant on Yelp and only gave it three stars. Â My wife, on the other hand, was thrilled with the consideration paid to my youngest son who has severe food allergies. Â His dishes were specially prepared with attention to his needs. Â She wanted me to get on Yelp and give it five stars to offset my daughter's three star review. Â So, here I am writing this. Â However, between my daughter's complaint and a couple of other small misses, I can't give the restaurant five stars in good conscience. Â To me, that should be reserved for something pretty exceptional. Â I had the frittata which I thought was very good, even if the potatoes were a bit bland. Would I go back for brunch? Â Yes, but we don't go out for brunch often, so there are other places I want to try next and I may not be back there for a while. Â However, I am looking forward to going back, probably for dinner next.",1
1420,3,3,5/18/2014,"Would really give it three and a half stars. Went for brunch with my family and we ordered a lot of different things. Eggs Benedict was overcooked...the eggs weren't runny at all, so if I went again I would specify. The blackened scramble was lamb instead of fish but the scallions were a little too powerful. Also, the food didn't come out all at the same time. But it was all plated attractively. The drinks were good and the live music was great! They were also really careful about food allergies and extremely accomodating. Atmosphere was great and so was the service. Would like to go for dinner.",1
1421,3,4,5/13/2014,This was the PERFECT place to take my mom for mother's day-- the food was incredible and I found the prices to be really reasonable (as far as NYC inflated prices go). I can't believe they opened in January and I've missed months of good food...,1
1422,3,5,5/11/2014,"Amazing menu, delicious food with awesome ingredients. Â The ricotta gnocchi is a must try!",1
1423,3,5,5/4/2014,"Dekalb Restaurant is a neighbourhood gem that hits all the right notes: great community spirit, lovely refurbished atmosphere, an incredibly friendly staff who all take the time to get to know you, and amazing food. In an era which is increasingly hands-off, it's nice to know that there's still pockets of community like this restaurant. We've been here for both dinner and brunch, and both times the food has been supremely outstanding. Dekalb specializes in the veg options, though there are still options for us meat-eaters (oh, how the tables have turned!). Prices are low, and though the portions are reflective of the cost, they're not absurdly Lilliputian like it can be in Manhattan. The best part, especially for someone that doesn't drink all that much, is that they have creative non-boozy -- the Bluestone (their take on a virgin Bloody Mary) is damned good for brunch, while the Brozost (lemon, thyme, and sparkling water) is a bubbly treat you need to have asap. As I've mentioned before, service is incredibly friendly. They are very much aware of the ingredients in their dishes, which is great since one of us does come with a strange food allergy. Don't expect to be rushed into decisions or eating by the service -- Dekalb lets you linger from beginning to end, all with smiles and thanks at the end of the meal. It's no wonder we're very excited that this place is only a few blocks away for dinner and weekend brunch, and I expect it'll be one of our neighbourhood staples shortly.",1
1424,3,5,4/23/2014,"I stopped in here yesterday & I was transported to a Euro vibe oasis. Mark was behind the bar and he is definitely quite the apothecary. Like my fellow reviewers mentioned, I was not rushed and was in fact welcomed like a member of the family. All the workers are local and care about the future of Brooklyn. They have a garden that will house their own home grown produce, which is AWESOME. The restaurant is made of old salvaged architecture and its definitely worth a snap or two. While dining I also met Ras and Stefan who are also a breath of fresh air from your typical restaurant owners. They also plan on having live music on Saturday and Sundays. Check it out, I feel there is more to come from Dakalb Restaurant",1
1425,3,5,4/22/2014,"I absolutely love this place! Mark, the man behind the bar has a good head on his shoulders. Friendly, sociable and genuinely excited about what he's doing! Â We only came in for a cocktail, and stayed for a few more than that. As a bartender, I appreciate the small but well selected liquor selection. Mark knows his products and you can tell he selected each one of them for a specific reason. The lamb looks amazing! I'll have to get it next time. In terms of the space, it's absolutely beautiful! I love it here!",1
1426,3,5,4/14/2014,"After hearing so many good things about this spot , I decided to take my girlfriend to Dekalb Restaurant for brunch. Needless to say the food was amazing! Due to the fact that Dekalb Restaurant opened in January of this year, there is still a bit of menu restructurin. There were not too many dishes to pick from the brunch menu, however, each dish is outstanding. The polenta banana porridge is crazy good. Just a hint of banana that is brought out with The side muesli, and a nice savory edge with the egg and bacon side platter. The blackened rocky scramble also excites the taste-buds and is well balanced Loved the service and the whole feel of the establishment. Decor is very nice indeed. Highly recommended for all. It is also a family friendly establishment !!",1
1427,3,4,4/13/2014,Great ambience and super nice staff. Came here for brunch and it's so relaxed and fun! The food is so simple but so delicious and full of really beautiful flavors. I will definitely be frequenting this place as it's a great neighborhood joint with class!,1
1428,3,5,4/6/2014,"To say Dekalb is a hidden gem in Brooklyn's Bed-Stuy would be an understatement. I had the privilege of dining there Friday night with some friends and from the moment I walked in the door I felt at home. Our server, Jaime, had extensive menu knowledge and was attentive without being overbearing. I had the mushroom ravioli and tried the lamb, the ravioli was a perfect blend of flavors and the lamb was juicy and tender enough to eat with only a fork. My party and I were graced with the company of two of the owners, Mark and Ras. While Mark told us jokes we were treated to a musical performance by Ras. This is a man full of soul who channels it through his acoustic guitar. I plan to be a regular here, at what will hopefully be a longstanding staple in Brooklyn.",1
1429,3,5,4/5/2014,"This restaurant is just delicious. A great addition to the neighborhood with a very unique menu. You will want to try everything! The food is cooked with love and you can taste it!

1430,3,4,3/30/2014,"Dekalb restaurant is amazing! Really great food and a relaxed atmosphere. Eat the lamb, the Gnocchi, the Polenta fries (!!!!), the brussel sprouts and probably anything else on the menu because it all seems great! Even better, Dekalb is BYOB for the moment so you can get out of there for very cheap. There is a well stocked corner store practically next door with some pretty good beer. Eat here, I promise you will love the food!",1
1431,3,1,3/26/2014,"Truly disappointing. Like The Runner, Dekalb Restaurant devises a rustic menu with eclectic ingredients but fails the average taste test. Whoever made the veggie burger should be hog-tied and forced fed that uninspired mush. I'm not expecting Alice Waters by any means. The poorly executed farm to table concept leaves me craving a good old slice. Â They need to reinvent their menu, rethink their uneven portions and lackluster flavored food, hire a writer, and get rid of the low seats.",1
1432,3,5,3/23/2014,"Nice brunch place for an alternative. Â Beautifully decorated and extra friendly staff. Â Had biscuits and leek leek gravy and Clementine ice cream and shortbread cookies. Â Was really stuffed after all that but it all was good and will be back. Â Anyone who is into things like sustainability, not wasting food, environment, etc will love the background of the business, which is use everything and make as much ingredients as they can. Â With that said, the place isn't that expensive, atleast for a brunch. Â  And some of the employees like heavy metal. Â That alone merits an extra star, but unfortunately Yelp only allows 5;)",1
1433,3,5,3/10/2014,"I had a great experience here! I will start off with the cons to get them out of the way: - No liquor license, yet. But I'm not even sure that's a negative, because it was BYOB. So ... - The seating was a little low for me compared to the table. I'm 5'5"" ish and felt like a kid at the grown-up table. - Uh, that's it for the cons. The atmosphere is BEAUTIFUL, all low-lit golden glow and rustic-meets-bohemian sort of feel. When I was on my way there, as I walked by it I thought, ""wow, that place looks so cool, I want to go there"" before realizing that's where I was meeting my date. Even the bathrooms are mad pretty. My vegetarian date and I (it's a nice date spot) ordered like 4 things and split. I will try to remember what they were, although they all had a laundry list of exotic ingredients. Butternut squash tater tots (yummy although a bit greasy and fell apart....but like I said, yummy); parsnip gnocchi (GET THIS); kohlrabi kimchi melt sandwich (reminded me of banh mi); veggie burger. The portions are all smallish in size, but when we finished our meal we were full as heck. And trust, we ate it all because it was delicious. The service was so friendly and excellent! Once they get their liquor license and the bar in the front is in action, I think this place is really going to take off. You should go there before it's hip so you can say you already knew about it. It's a quick walk from the G. I have warm and fuzzy feelings about it.",1
1434,3,5,3/6/2014,"what a great place. very low key, good prices, incredible food. the atmosphere is formal yet friendly, excellent date spot. BYOB Â for now",1
1435,3,5,3/4/2014,"This is literally the first yelp review I've ever written - I've never been impressed enough Â to bother before now. Â  Amazing food, gorgeously rustic space with a welcoming atmosphere and attentive and friendly service. The food was beautiful. Quality seasonal ingredients star in a healthy and innovative menu that Â follows through in execution. Everything we tasted (most of the menu, because the prices allow or it!) was expertly prepared to showcase the ingredients with thoughtful additions and garnishes that added delightful bursts of flavor and texture to create a truly nuanced dish.",1
1436,3,4,3/1/2014,"Great food and fantastic friendly informative service. I'm vegetarian and the mix and quality of the ingredients and presentation was spot on, but don't let my vegemess dissuade you. The trout was 'excellent' according to my non vege dining partner. And every appetiser we had was a winner. Currently doesn't have a liquor licence so bring your own - we did , no corkage. Couple of tips - the entrees aren't that big compared to the appetisers, so consider treating Â it like tapas and go for lots of appetisers or order appetisers with your entree. And the shortbread was the only disappointment - great flavour just not enough butter. Overall, lovely food, great ambience and super friendly interested and interesting staff. Had a great time and will definitely go back.",1
1437,3,5,2/23/2014,"First of, the decor: the repurposed wood, windows and furniture add amazing character to this space. It's a perfect Sunday brunch spot. The prices are good. Food was tasty and left me wanting to come back and try other things on the menu. The service is so welcoming and more than happy to answer questions about the space and surrounding neighborhood. I hope this place sticks around for a long time!",1
1438,3,5,2/15/2014,"Amazing food- ham, melted leeks, banana polenta, was super great. Braised lamb could add some plain couscous,but super delicious with crispy kale. Decor is also super Brooklyn brownstone inspired, spacious, and almost church-like very warm. Can't wait for the summer when the gates open and the space will feel even more airy. They also have a garden in the back so fresh veges in summer will be nice too. Looking forward to it.",1
1439,3,5,2/10/2014,"Dekalb is amazing! Â I feel like my words can not even do it justice, but I shall try... Â The restaurant its-self is inspiring, made of all reclaimed wood, and the old hospital windows lining the ceilings and walls cause the vibes from the awesome band to flow throughout without being loud. Â The Staff is friendly, and is eager to welcome you to the neighborhood. Â  The Mussels are served in a creamy salsify and leek broth, and the portion is generous. Â I found myself looking for more items than just the grilled bread into the broth, at one point I think I may have just been eating it with a spoon. The Polenta fries, infused with banana, smothered in a leek ragout, and topped with crispy Serrano ham.....someone sure knows the way to a womans heart! Â The perfect combination of crispy, creamy, salty, savory, and je ne sais quoi! The Lamb exceeded my already high expectations for it...fork tender, melt in your mouth, braised goodness! Â served with perfectly cooked root vegetables and crispy kale which added the perfect texture to the soft lamb...ugh still dreaming about it 5 days later the panna cotta sort of blew my mind...now I graduated from culinary school, and I have experienced panna cotta quite a bit in top restaurants, even made it myself...but NEVER have I experienced a panna cotta this creamy, this rich, this.....addictive! Â I have never been a huge fan of panna cotta, I could take it or leave it usually but the panna cotta with caramel 'glass' Â had the texture of an insanely creamy cheesecake!! I can't even fathom how they managed to achieve this velvety, decadent mouth-feel but needless to say I will be back...to try every last item on the menu, hang out with the friendly staff and take in the good vibes! Â The only downside of Dekalb is that I don't live in Brooklyn!",1

I work up the block on Willoughby Ave and it is super hard to resist popping in for a bite now. I went there on a date and all of the menu choices were different, appealing, and savory! Tried the mussels and ate them all. My date had the braised lamb. Little known fact: it is B.Y.O.B., so I brought a delicious Spanish Cider from Bed Stuy Beer Works and it was THE combo breaker for dinner.",1
1442,3,4,2/1/2014,"I ate here with my girlfriend last night and we both thought it was very good. Â We split the fried brussels sprout to start and I had the almond stuffed trout and she had the vegetable burger. Â This place definitely has its own twist on food with some unique combinations of high quality ingredients simply presented. Sort of like the restaurant Â itself. Everything in the restaurant is salvaged - the floors are from some renovated building on the UWS, the backlit windows that surround the dining room like an atrium are from an old hospital, and the seats are church pews. And the staff is fantastic, and just very friendly and accommodating all around. I will definitely be back.",1

Â We went for brunch on a busy Sunday afternoon and couldn't wait to get our food since we were pretty hungry. Â  First off, my mimosa was lukewarm. Â Second, my fries were lukewarm as well and tasted as if they were cooked 30 minutes ago. Â The dining room was packed so I though the turnover would be decent and the food fresh. Â The egg on my omelette was so thick and the egg:filling ratio was 3 to 1. Â I had about 10 thinly sliced mushrooms in my entire omelette and a half inch pancake concoction of egg. Â  Now onto the service. Â We lingered after meal over coffee and both eventually finished our cups. Â I see the waiter walking by with a fresh pot of coffee and I'm already thinking in my head, ""thanks but no thanks"". Â I didn't even get a chance to kindly pass a refill of coffee because he walked right by us to fill a lady's cup and went right back to put the pot away. Â  Maybe Le Parisien caught me on a bad day but mediocre food and below average service don't belong in NY. Â  On a good note, it's really cute inside and the decor seems tres french.",-1
1445,4,3,6/1/2014,"Came for Saturday brunch around 12:30. There were about 4 different groups there. Nice for a budget brunch. Options are limited but you definitely get enough food to fill you. We ordered omelettes so they came with a small salad and fries. The wild mushroom omelette was delicious, but not gonna lie, I was a little skeptical about whether they used real eggs or not. Fries were amazing! so we ordered an extra side. Coffee was average. Salad was really yum too. Staff was nice. Offered to refill coffee after we paid the bill. Checked on us. Very small place so do not come with a group. The rating might be on the low side but I would recommend it and go again if I were nearby.",-1

The wine was also very good, only drawback was that since they don't have a full liquor license, my Dad was left wanting for after-dinner cognac... The profiteroles and coffee made up for it nicely though. The place/tables are quite small, but it's quaint if you don't end up between two other tables, and we were lucky to get a table against a divider. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised, and would definitely recommend it.",-1

Their food is fantastic and their steak frites are very hearty and filling. The service was stellar, 5 stars. Oh and did I mention the kitchen is CLEAN. Le Parisien definitely met my needs for some filet mignon.We had great, great time, will definitely have to come back here.",-1

1462,4,5,7/5/2014,"Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren, Â  Ich und meine Frau stammen aus Ausland. Wir leben Â schon Ã¼ber zehn Jahre in Bundesrepublik Deutschland und haben nie einmal gedacht, wie viel AuslÃ¤nderhass steckt in manchen Deutschen. Aber dass deutsches Gericht diesen Hass unterstÃ¼tzt, hatte ich nie einmal erwartet. Ich mÃ¶chte mich kurz fassen. Es geht um das Urteil Im Namen des Volkes des Amtsgerichts Schorndorf unter dem Aktenzeichen 6 C 327/13, verkÃ¼ndet am 07.11.2013. Die deutsche Familie H. (KlÃ¤ger) hat die AuslÃ¤ndische Familie (mich und meine Familie Â = Angeklagte) Ã¼ber Jahre als Verbrecher dargestellt. Eines Tages haben die AuslÃ¤nder (ich) die Deutschen angefordert sich an der Wahrheit zu halten. Also, keine LÃ¼gengeschichten mehr. Die Deutschen waren Â damit so beleidigt, dass sie die auslÃ¤ndische Familie (wieder aufgrund bewusst gelogener Anzeige!) vor Gericht gestellt hatten! Das Gericht hat bewiesen, dass deutsche Familie die ganzen, rein erfundenen Geschichten doch Â nicht nur mÃ¼ndlich, sondern auch schriftlich jahrelang dar gelegt hatte. Auch dass die Klage auf einer bewussten LÃ¼ge basiert ist. Im Â Prozess kam mehr aufs Licht, dies wurde aber ""aus Versehen?"" nicht dokumentiert, z.B. dass der KlÃ¤ger mit dem Umlaufbrief sich beschÃ¤ftigte um AuslÃ¤nder zwangslÃ¤ufig aus dem Haus zu vertreiben (also klare Beweise des Hasses). Dabei wurden diese LÃ¼gengeschichten als Grund der ZwangsrÃ¤umung vorgesehen! Eigentlich, sollte es als bewusste, Â jahrelange Taten gegen AuslÃ¤ndische Familie heiÃŸen. Was wurde der auslÃ¤ndischen Familie vorgeworfen? Nur das, dass sie gefordert hat diesen Taten das Ende zu setzen. Aber, wie denken Sie, wer wurde Ã¼berwiegend (4.500,00 â‚¬) bestraft? Ja! AuslÃ¤nder! FÃ¼r das Gericht wurde es klar, dass die Familie H. in jedem Punkt gelogen hatte. Aber es war nicht wichtig! Wichtiger war die Frage: ""Warum hat AuslÃ¤nder gewagt den Deutschen zu sagen, dass sie mit LÃ¼gengeschichten aufhÃ¶ren mÃ¼ssen? Dabei war das Gericht ohne Beweise (erste Sitzung) gerechter als mit Beweisen! (zweite Sitzung). (Auch ein Beweis dafÃ¼r, dass die Beweise eigentlich keine Rolle spielen - die AuslÃ¤nder mÃ¼ssen Verbrecher sein!) Â  In der ersten Gerichtssitzung hat die Richterin Verschlag gemacht die Gerichtskosten 1/2 zu 1/2 zu teilen??? Das hat der KlÃ¤ger natÃ¼rlich voll abgelehnt. Auf die Frage der Richterin, was erwartet man vom Gericht? Antwortete der KlÃ¤ger: ""Es ist mir alles egal. Hauptsache Angeklagte mehr zahlt"". Und im zweiten Sitz wurde das Gericht zum Wunschkonzert des KlÃ¤gers! Ich habe das Urteil des Amtsgerichts und Sachverhalt einem anderen Rechtsanwalt gegeben. Er hat erst gesagt, dass das Urteil sehr komisch sei und er wird mit Berufungsklage beim Landgericht Stuttgart Â das Urteil widerrufen. SpÃ¤ter war er sehr empÃ¶rt. Mir hat er nur eines gesagt, dass sie alle zusammen sind und wir erreichen dort nichts auÃŸer weitere 4000,00 â‚¬ zu zahlen. (Beschluss GeschÃ¤ftsnummer: 13 S 208/13 Aktenzeichen: 6 C 327/13 des Landgerichts Stuttgart). Ist es der politische Trend, dass man die AuslÃ¤nder als Verbrecher darstellen soll? Also, deutsche lÃ¼gen, sogar in der Anklage. AuslÃ¤nder zahlen - so lautet das Gerichtsurteil. Damit wurde Hetzjagd aber noch lÃ¤ngst nicht beendet. In der EigentÃ¼merversammlung 2014 hat Herr Hausverwalter, vom Gerichtsurteil motiviert, gesagt, dass es, unter anderem Versperren der KellertÃ¼r usw. als Bote an uns gewesen war, Â dass wir (AuslÃ¤nder) in dem Haus nicht gewÃ¼nscht sind und ich soll aufhÃ¶ren mich zu verteidigen. Was Ã¼ber mich und meine Familie erzÃ¤hlt wird, soll ich schweigend annehmen. Ich wollte wiedersprechen mit der Aussage: ""Aber nicht die LÃ¼gengeschichten..."" Und habe die Antwort von Hausverwalter erhalten: ""Wenn es euch nicht gÃ¤be, sollte Familie H. nicht lÃ¼gen""??? Hat Familie H. im Auftrag gelogen um zu zeigen wie schlecht AuslÃ¤nder sein sollen??! Â  Also, scheinbar, immer Ã¶fter in Deutschland das Wort ""AuslÃ¤nder"" automatisch mit dem Wort ""Verbrecher"" identifiziert"" ist. Damit wurde noch nicht das Ende der Geschichte gesetzt. Vor dem Gericht wurden nur bÃ¶se Geschichten Ã¼ber AuslÃ¤nder ausgesprochen. Jetzt kam es zu Erniedrigungstaten. Jetzt hat ihr Hass, vom Gerichtsurteil motiviert, sich weiterentwickelt - von LÃ¼gen bis zum Rechte weg zu nehmen. Â Das Gericht, anstatt Hass zu bremsen, hat das Gegenteil erreicht. In der EigentÃ¼merversammlung 2014 hat Herr Hausverwalter einen Vorschlag gemacht, der AuslÃ¤nderfamilie ihre Rechte auf GemeinnÃ¼tzige RÃ¤ume Â zu benutzen, stark zu reduzieren, im Vergleich mit den anderen EigentÃ¼mern. Auf die Frage, warum die AuslÃ¤nder nicht gleiche Rechte haben dÃ¼rfen, hat Herr Verwalter folgende Antwort gegeben: ""Die Frage ist richtig, die AuslÃ¤nder haben das Recht, aber wen juckt das? Wir nehmen ihnen diese Rechte einfach weg. Â (Protokoll EigentÃ¼merversammlung 2014). Herr Verwalter hat auch gesagt, dass das Haus, seit AuslÃ¤ndische Familie Â die Wohnung gekauft hatte, hat viel am Wert verloren. FrÃ¼her wohnten im Haus nur die Deutsche, jetzt nicht",-1

Â Food as was described by others excellent, Â if basic. and typical. Â I had the onion soup which was delicious and the steak frites. Steak was cooked perfectly a point and frites were crispy, Â salad was fresh. Â The only other French bistro that compares food wise is Artisanal on which is a much larger, elegant and expensive affair on 33rd and betwn. Park and Madison.

Â If you are looking for a fancy French restaruant, Le Parisein may not be your choice. But if you are looking for real French food, unintimidating and real down to earth atmosphere, you must come here. We enjoyed all the 3 apeptizers that the owner recommended, escargot was served with real shells, duck confit was chunky and done well. I wasn't feeling too well, so I only had a French onion soup, the best onion soup I ever tasted, not salty at all, infact you can taste the sweetness Â that came through with tons of sweet onion condensed in the base. My husband had the steak tartar. He said it tasted like what he had in France when he went there on business but bigger portion. My daughter had the Marseilles mussels, she loved it so much that she took the left over brooth home with her. Even the French flies were done to perfection, not greasy, serve up in an aluminum can to keep them warm (brilliant ) and you can taste real hand picked potatoes! For dessert, we absolutely loved the creme brÃ»lÃ©e, very creamy and not too sweet at all. A must try! Service was excellent with just the right amount of attentiveness.

I persist because I enjoy seeing whether honest human communication can survive in an increasingly computerized world. I find this the most comfortable and enjoyable restaurant in the neighborhood, lunching there once a week on chicken in a few forms or liver or portobello (the sandwich is a very nice construction) or papardelle with either Bordeaux, Malbec or Cote de Rhone. Mussels once in a while. In almost two years, believe it or not, only a single dish (cauliflower soup) failed to please me. Perhaps it is best that my reviews be censored because it is getting increasingly crowded at lunchtime. Happy New Year!",-1

The atmosphere is real (Christian, the owner, professional and friendly, Â was born in Paris, and has worked in the best restaurants in NY for 20 years), the food is to die for and very affordable (classic dishes like escargots, frisee lardon poached egg, pate, soupe du jour, steak frites (home-made), confit de canard, etc... as well as creative dishes like a cod fish with mashed potatoes and black olives, skate with pumpkin risotto, moules frites with saffron, etc...). As far as the wines, you can either order a glass (10 different options), carafe or bottle. As a french native, i hardly recommend this new restaurant (opened last july and already packed). Also, great date place because it's cosy, and the music is very low, so you can talk ! Also, the $11.95 brunch is worth a cab ride if you don't live midtown. Bon appetit !",-1

1485,4,4,12/23/2014,"Unpretentious Delight! There are so many world class restaurants in Manhattan competing for the diner dollar serving overpriced food overwrought with gimmicks that I'm almost expecting my Buddakan server to grace the table laden in 'flair'. Â Enter Le Parisien. Located mid-town east Murray Hill (lots of legal street parking within 3 or 4 blocks P metered so don't forget to print, pay and display) in a tight space of 95% banquet seating (thus 4 stars not 5) although there is one sweet little table, on it's own, Â right on the french door window in front if you prefer privacy. You can book this table in advance. The atmosphere is very European. No multi-million dollar decor. Â The chairs are steel and wooden school chairs and the tables are rough painted and so perfectly adequate. Â Waiter just friendly enough, owner stands on a raised bar surveying, pouring and drinking wine Â presenting a menu of about 15 entrees all reasonably priced between $20-$26. The menu includes all the ""french"" classics as mentioned in other reviews-Steak Frites, Rainbow Trout ""Almondine"" and Duck Confit as well as some country dishes like Sauteed Calf's Liver and Pan Roasted half Chicken. Â You can also order escarcot and creme brulee but step out of your comfort zone and try something different! For starters we ordered the Duck County Pate with Cornichons and the Endive Salad. Â Pate was rustic and simply delectable. For the mains I ordered the Roasted Chicken. Don't let the ""half-chicken portion scare you. Â Le Parisien are not buying huge growth hormone fueled chickens here. Â The drumstick was only the size of those grotesque Hooter's drum wings making the portion just perfect. Served on a bed of simple mash, skin well seared and crisp surrounded by gorgeous fresh tarragon (used spot on sparingly) pan reduction and button mushrooms. Â The dish came piping hot-because when you make unpretentious food that hasn't been fussed on my 6 sous chefs, that's what happens. Ordering roast chicken brings out the honestly of the chef-and chef didn't lie. The dessert was so so good I demand you order it! Haha but seriously. Ile Flottante- French slow cooked meringues floating in a devine creme anglaise topped with shaved and slightly salted roasted almonds. Â Cry. Â Perfection.

1493,4,3,12/3/2014,"I really enjoyed Le Parisien, I just don't know if it's memorable enough for 4 stars. Let's call it 3.5 - my first ever half-star. Judging against the endless sea of options in NYC, if my friends booked dinner there, I would be happy to go. I probably wouldn't seek it out myself for a second trip back because I would rather try something new. Our table had the duck and the steak, and both plates were cleaned by the end of the meal. The service was at first a little pushy - came to the table to often and too quickly - then they eventually sort of left us alone. We were able to get a same-day reservation for Friday night at 8:45. It's a cozy little spot, probably around 15 tables, and while there were other people there it did feel a little private which was nice.",1
1494,4,4,12/1/2014,"charming spot, great food, friendly but professional staff was not prepared for how quickly the food came out---my only suggestion would be a breather before dessert Â (floating islands---to die for!)",1
1495,4,5,11/30/2014,"This place is a diamond in the rough. Â It's one of the reasons why you should never judge a book by its cover. Â At first glance, the place is really small with 2 person tables...and not many of them. Â If you are a party of more than 4, I doubt they will be able to seat you timely because the place is packed. Â Having said that...the food was excellent. Â I ordered the eggs Benedict and it was delicious. Â Perfectly cooked and served with a salad (which the French are known for) and delicious fries. Â Service was extremely fast . Â If you are looking for a classy elegant place....this place is not for you. Â If you want excellent Â food, Â this place is a MUST!",1
1496,4,4,11/29/2014,"Great food at surprisingly good prices! I like this cozy little restaurant, only thing I wasn't too fond of was the service. Not the worst I've received but definitely needs some work... Everything we ordered other than our mains - like bread and water took waaay too long and the waiter was quite unfriendly. Maybe it was an off day but everything else was great so I'll sure be back :)",1
1497,4,4,11/28/2014,"Somewhat small space, so expect to get cozy. :) Fantastic food!",1
1498,4,3,11/23/2014,"Great food, poor service. Â We had a 7:15pm reservation but came early to find the restaurant empty. Â We explained that our friends were meeting us at the reservation time but asked if we could sit down at a table, have a bottle of wine and wait. They were happy to oblige. Â However, when our friends arrived (on time for our reservation) they came to the table to tell us that we would have to hurry up as they had other seatings lined up. (There were still empty tables in the restaurant, and continued to be throughout our stay). They then proceeded to rush us through the first course, clearing plates before we were all finished and serving the second course before we finished the first. Â While the dishes were lovely, well prepared and served with style, the attitude of the staff really put a damper on our evening.",1
1499,4,5,11/20/2014,"Came here for a double date on a Saturday night. We had reservations for 6pm but we came a little earlier. We were greeted by a friendly host who sat us right away. We were surprised that the place was practically empty, however, that did not last long. In no time it was filled with people. It's a really cute, small restaurant that has a classic feel to it. There is a large selection of wine. They do not do cocktails but there is always wine! =D The prices were reasonable for good food, especially in the city. We started off with some delicious appetizers. We had the mussels in garlic and white wine sauce, yum! I do not usually like mussels but these were so good. The sauce was great. My friend and I split the baby spinach salad with goat cheese, almonds, tomatoes and some special sauce which was so fresh and light. For my entree I had the salmon. My friends had the pork, calf liver (YUM!) and the bistro steak. Everything was so delicious, we loved it all! So flavorful, fresh and amazing! Dessert followed, as if we didnt eat enough =x I had the creme brulee (YESSSSSSSS!!!!!) my friends had the apple tart and the floating island. Once again everything was great. Overall, we were really impressed and satisfied with the services, the food, and the atmosphere. Def recommend it. Will have to come back for the brunch special.",1
1500,4,4,11/18/2014,"I don't believe they do cocktails, I saw nothing but wine behind the bar. I did however have a nice glass of dry Chardonnay that was recommended by the waiter. The bread was kind of burnt and hard and the butter was too cold. The endive salad is literally the best thing I've had in awhile; roasted pears, Roquefort cheese, walnut, port vinaigrette... I almost ordered another one.The Escargots with herbs and garlic butter was good as well. I got the atlantic salmon with baby vegetable risotto and saffron sauce upon recommendation over the steak. The salmon was cooked perfectly as was the rice, however the vegetables were overdone and the sauce very nearly ruined the dish. It had this strange thick orange component, I couldn't really taste the saffron at all, I tried to scrap most of it off. Wish I'd gotten a different entree. Los profiteroles for dessert was solid, the chocolate was the right consistency as was the cream to puff ratio. Good experience, pricey though.",1
1501,4,1,11/18/2014,"Saw so many good reviews and was excited to try this place out. Went on a Sunday night around 8 pm and we were greeted by an INCREDIBLY rude host who came over to us and said, ""Yes?"" Errr. WHAT?! Excuse me, but you do NOT greet your customers that way. Then he asked us whether we had a reservation, and we said no. He told us the wait would be 30 minutes and ignored us, before we even said we wanted to wait. My girlfriend was so pissed we immediately walked out. How ridiculously rude. I will never support an establishment like this. No one deserves to be treated like this.",1
1502,4,4,11/17/2014,"Got here right at 12PM when they opened for brunch on Sunday. Thank goodness because by 12:30pm there was a wait Great food for $15.95 AND you get a coffee, OJ, sangria or Mimosa with your meal. Service was fast, prompt, friendly and food was out in a jiffy. Omelette's were simple and scrumptious. Croquette with ham and cheese on brioche was very soft and flavorful. My smoked salmon eggs Benedict was delicious. The best is that they serve you a side salad AND fries because let's face it, everyone wants a little of both! Overall, very positive and successful experience and I'll def. be back.",1
1503,4,4,11/15/2014,"I went in for lunch yesterday while searching for another restaurant in the neighborhood. The staff were very personable and funny, as well as attentive. I will definitely be going back!",1
1504,4,4,11/13/2014,"small intimate lovely place. great food & wine. very kind and knowledgable hotsts. recommend escargots, steak frites and onion soup which was not salty and perfect for a chilly day!",1
1505,4,4,11/13/2014,"One night, my friend and I were stressed at work and decided we needed a ""night in Paris"". So, we stopped by this place after our oh-so-stressful jobs. I was a bit worried because I hadn't made reservations but we were seated immediately, even though the place was full (it was a Monday night). First off, it's situated in a quiet part of the city - accessible by the 6 train. We ordered the mussels and the salmon. The salmon was cooked SO perfectly. I gobbled that fish up. It was on top of this really flavorful risotto with vegetables. That risotto was gone in seconds. The mussels itself were good (but not out of this world) but that sauce was ah-mazing! We kept requesting bread so we could mop that up! Deeelish. The average cost for an entree is about $20 so it is a bit expensive but it is French food after all. The service is a bit slow but they were friendly enough. I wish I had tried their desserts (I'm a huge fan of French desserts) but I was just way too full to do it. I will definitely come back though.",1
1506,4,4,11/12/2014,"One of my favorite spots in the city for a sleepy brunch. They don't open until 11:00, and the place is very small, but the Parisian vibe is really perfect for a homey cafe style with a friend of two.",1
1507,4,5,11/9/2014,"A quaint little restuarant. Â Not too much seating so make sure you get there early. We got there and no one was there by the time we ordered no empty seat left. The food was delicious I had the duck confit with crispy potatoes and wild mushrooms. I ate it all, the duck was so tender the potatoes were cooked perfectly crispy.The desser was aesome as well I tried the Apple Tart and Â Profiterole. I actually ordered the Apple Tart and ended up loving the Profiterole Â so much more.",1
1508,4,5,11/7/2014,"The Pan Roasted Half Chicken and Braised Duck Leg were awesome. Â The chicken was in a brown sauce, while the duck has a salty savory taste. Â Both were crispy on the outside. Â I also recommend getting a side of their fries. For desert, the profiteroles ice cream and chocolate sauce were to die for. Â The ice cream had a vanilla flavor. The cafe americano and creme brulee were good, but did not stand out.",1
1509,4,4,11/7/2014,The artichoke salad is ridiculously good,1
1510,4,2,10/29/2014,"Four of us went for dinner. Â Everything was edible, but not a single appetizer or entree or dessert was better than mediocre. Â The service was neither rude nor gracious, but it was certainly not very professional. Â I think there are many other French bistros in New York where the prices are similar and the cooking far better.",1
1511,4,5,10/28/2014,The first word that comes to mind is authentic. Â Every time I walk into Le Parisien I am reminded of several of my favorite meals in Paris. Â The space is small and the decor is a bit sparse but the service and food are truly outstanding. Â Everything I have tried has been wonderful; from the french onion soup to the trout almondine and to the steak frites which is anything but basic. Â I have been here several times and will absolutely continue to come back.,1
1512,4,4,10/26/2014,Had Calf's liver and Carpaccio. Both were delicious.,1
1513,4,5,10/24/2014,"Close to getting your Paris fix, lovely French dÃ©cor in a cozy place. Very decent wine list and no more than 10 minute wait during a fairly busy dinner time. My escargots were not bad at all. Customer service was good. I enjoyed myself.",1
1514,4,5,10/24/2014,"This is really authentic French food and it tastes better than I remember it in France. It's homey and small, the chairs against the walls are not comfortable, but the food is delicious. Their house bordeux has a sweet finish which i am not accustomed to so i stuck with the malbec. Started with escargot and it tasted so good, it was drenched in butter. The smell from the next table made me order it and subsequently the smell from my order made the next table order it too! Take the bread and dip it in that escargot butter, it is amazing. I ordered the steak frites and the french onion soup. This is by far the best french onion soup i have ever had. the soup was salted and flavorful but not too salty and the onions were stewed to perfection, it wasn't super soggy from sitting on the stove way too long. it was so good, id go back just for the soup. the steak tasted stewed and ab it tough for medium but it was covered in the best wine sauce and the fries to go with it was just amazing. extra crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I arrived 40 minutes earlier than my reservation and the staff was so nice to me, they even let me sit down first and munch on bread til the rest of the party arrived and was patient to explain dishes to me. I will definitely be back!!",1
1515,4,2,10/19/2014,"I came here today for a girl's brunch for the first time. We got there pretty early so we got a table right away. We all ordered from the Prixe Fixe menu which was $15.95 for eggs, salad, french fries and a choice of a drink. Overall, the food was pretty good, and the price was reasonable. However, there were a few problems with the service, which we weren't too pleased about, primarily because this is a small and crowded restaurant: When we ordered, we were told that we couldn't change anything on the menu, even if it was due to an allergy especially because it was so crowded. When we were all done eating except for one girl in our group, Â the staff Â kept coming over to ask if she was done eating and got more aggressive about it over time. By the 6th or so time, one of them even said ""Still not done?"" or something to that effect. Mind you, we have only been there for about an hour to an hour and half. I understand they are busy and want to move people along but people go out to eat to relax and to make us feel rushed is just plain rude. I might come back or recommend this place to someone just as long as they are quick eaters.",1
1516,4,4,10/16/2014,"Great find! What's with brunch places on 33rd and 3rd? So many, so good, so cheap! We came for the brunch deal of $15.95 for entree and drink. I got the Poached Eggs with Salmon Gravlax with Sangria. Definitely recommend getting the Sangria, it's huge! A lot bigger than the mimosa that comes in a tiny champagne glass. The food was phenomenal. There was a lot of salmon. The poached eggs were just the right amount of runny. I really enjoyed my dish. Plus it comes with fries and salad (both average, but average is good!) Very pleased with the entree, and extremely filling. I'll definitely come back again. The only downside is how small the place is. Not good for groups. You will feel squished and you will probably have atleast a short wait.",1
1517,4,5,10/16/2014,"For a location so well located to all attractions and sights in NYC I am blown away by the price. Â This location is very cozy, i would say unless you are a snob, which most people that come here are not you sit so close to the neighboring tables that it is almost impossible not to have a conversation or be engaged with them. Â The bathroom is so close to the back that you almost feel as you walk there that you are working with the staff. Â The staff is extremely friendly and energetic, there are some older staff but there is still a very good young blood hipster feel here. Â This location is very French themed, very intimate small Paris dining, with the tables painted with the number and a need to pull out the table for people to sit. Â I would say if you are looking for really fine dining this is not the location for you. Â With that said if you would like amazingly good food and energetic atmosphere this may infact be the location for you. Â Easily one of my favorite dishes of my life was the Duck Confet that i had here, it had a combination of flavors unlike anything i had ever eaten. Â We did the French Onion soup for desert of course, it was really really sweet but still easily the best soup i have ever had. Â My fiance had the steak, the fries were smaller sweet potato fries, the steak wasn't overwhelmingly delicious but still very good. Â At the prices you can't beat this location, it is almost worth more considerations for most dining location in NYC as being a once in a blue moon for a special occasion and could be considered a place to go 2-3 times a month. Reservations a must as they are small and always busy. Â Wine best deal by the bottle.",1
1518,4,4,10/15/2014,Steak frite is amazing. And def get the crume brulee for desert!!!! It's a real French brÃ»lÃ©e :). Bon appetite!,1
1519,4,5,10/12/2014,"This place is so adorable and its one of the few places I will keep going back to. The food is very French, the wine selection is good and the service is stellar. Note that the place is tiny and there is little elbow room. You will not do well to bring a bunch of shopping bags.",1
1520,4,1,10/6/2014,"This place does NOT deserve 4 stars. The smoked salmon was old and tasted horrible, the English muffins on the eggs florentine were soggy and the omelette was greasy. The website made this restaurant seem upscale but it was cramped and shabby. There was one small toilet next to the kitchen. I trusted Yelp and wanted to bring my friend to a beautiful French restaurant for brunch. She was disgusted by it instead. Under no circumstances does this place rate 4 stars.",1
1521,4,5,10/5/2014,The space was tight but the food was excellent.,1
1522,4,4,10/4/2014,Decent little brunch place. Their $15.95 brunch set is sweet. Loved their sangria (hmm...) Pros: -$15.95 gets you a choice of coffee/OJ/mimosa/sangria plus an entree. Good deal! - they have around 8-10 entree choices to choose from (not bad) - both of our entrees were very large portions (my kind of style) - the food came out in less than 15min so it was perfect since we were in a rush -they have a small clean bathroom in the back -decent service Cons: -it's a small place so there could be a wait. We came at 12pm on Saturday and had no issues for two people -the lighting is a bit dark for my liking (especially if you sit more inside). We sat right by the window so had a lot of sunlight This is a cute place to have a quick brunch or a long brunch with a mighty good sangria.,1
1523,4,5,10/1/2014,"Very good food, reasonable prices, the ambiance of a french bistro.",1
1524,4,3,9/30/2014,Escargot: Average: buttery and garlicky. Country Pate: Lacked flavor Duck Confit: a little on the salty side but great with the mushrooms! Steak frites: YUM! amazing sauce and perfectly cooked.,1
1525,4,4,9/25/2014,"I can't wait to come back for dinner! Dinner for 2 seated promptly at 7:15pm (reservations via OpenTable). Small restaurant (40-50 persons), completely packed. We had a cozy booth next to the bar/cashier. Shared a bottle of Prosecco very reasonably priced at $39 ($12/glass). Overall the wine list is not so pricy. My friend ordered the STEAK FRITES ($24) - well sized portion, including a side of mixed salad as well. Cooked perfectly. I had the SKATE ($20) which was so yummy with the butter lemon sauce. Used a piece of fresh French bread to really taste it. Served over a good portion of perfectly cooked French beans. Entrees are pretty generous and well priced for the quality. If I lived in the neighborhood, I would be a regular. I look forward to returning and trying the entire menu and their specials - Challenge Accepted! (Def want to get the Steak Tartare and Duck Confit) Service was prompt in refilling water, refilling prosecco glasses and food seemed to have been served in under 15 minutes! AMEX accepted.",1
1526,4,4,9/24/2014,"I loved this little neighborhood French restaurant. Great food, wine and service. Really small and quaint. You feel like you are in France.",1
1527,4,4,9/23/2014,"Love this place. My hubby and I had dinner here and the experience was great! Reminded me very much of an traditional Parisian restaurant with ambience and all. We didn't need a reservation, the manager (I believe he was the mgr) seated us right away. He was very friendly and accommodating. Our server was nice and attentive as well. The restaurant is small and quaint, just like a traditional French restaurant in Paris. Atmosphere is warm and homey with classic pictures on white walls and candles lit on tables. It's romantic but you can easily go with friends as well. I had the pan seared half chicken. It was absolutely delicious! A great recommend. I had a glass of silky Bordeaux that paired well with my meal. My hubby had roasted salmon which was devine. It was more on the lighter side which was perfect and was exactly what he was looking for. I definitely will be back to try the steak frites and dessert (we didn't have room) when I visit NYC again. They looked amazing! I absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious French cuisine with great ambiance! Yum yum",1
1528,4,4,9/17/2014,"Went here for dinner with a friend. It's really tiny, but cutely decorated and seating is very tight, so you can hear your neighbors conversation. It was busy for a Tuesday night! Luckily we had reservations. We ordered mussels, duck confit, and skate. Everything was delicious, your basic French fare done well. The skate was especially good! The presentation of the plates was very lovely and thoughtful. Service was a little hectic but there was only one guy manning all the tables. They serve a lot of wine to patrons so it gets really loud. But I would recommend this place if you want to feel like you're eating in a French cafe.",1
1529,4,5,9/16/2014,"OMG what can I say but the food was fantastic. Â I am a French heritage American and love my basic cafe french cuisine. Â Everything here was perfectly served well, clean surroundings and rather friendly french management. Looking forward to eating here again in November on my next trip. Â Milles Mercis!",1
1530,4,4,9/16/2014,Like your sitting in cafÃ© in Paris.,1
1531,4,4,9/15/2014,I will definitely go back in the future. Ordered the steak frites and my friend ordered the duck confit. This petite bistro produce quality food with considerable prices. Suitable for cozy date or group of four. Â The restaurant is pretty petite so make a reservation to secure the spot. Quality french food with reasonable price.,1
1532,4,2,9/14/2014,"We decided to try this place a couple of weeks ago based on the yelp reviews. Needless to say we were pretty excited! I had the eggs benedict and my husband had the wild mushroom omlette. The dishes came out really quickly but it was definitely not what I was expecting. The food was poor quality but I guess that's why the food is so cheap. Furthermore the atmosphere was unpleasant, they really try and squeeze people in here so the tables were way too close to each other and you could hear everyone's conversations. Ok, so it is New York and a bit of a crowd should be expected but there are plenty of great brunch places with more organized seating. Our server seemed very keen to clear our table. Â Twice he almost took my plate, I'm a slow eater but if I'm chewing and holding my fork, that means I'm still eating mister! If you are after good quality breakfast/brunch food, don't bother with this place! There are great places in the village but if in midtown, Friedman's has better food options.",1
1533,4,4,9/14/2014,"Solid brunch food at very good price for NYC. No wonder they got good review and business. The place is small and packed. Even though we came around 2pm, we still waited about 10 minutes before seated. But once sat down, the food is served pretty quick.",1
1534,4,3,9/7/2014,"If I was solely rating the food, I would definitely give this place five stars. Â My three girlfriends and I planned for a last minute Sunday brunch. Â I literally live 10 steps away, therefore I told my friends to call me when they get there so that I would walk down. Â Even though the place was pretty empty with maybe 30% of their tables filled, they refused to seat them until our entire party showed up. Â When I showed up, we were still waiting for our fourth friend who got held up, therefore we told the host it would just be three so that we didn't have to wait standing. Â He actually removed the fourth chair from our table which we then had to ask him to put back when our friend showed up exactly 5 minutes later. I mean come on, was that necessary? The waitress was very nice and the food was yummy, however the ""we are doing you a favor by allowing you to eat here"" attitude needs to go. Oh, and when we payed with four credit cards, instead of splitting the bill evenly, the waitress charged us all different amounts and did not even tell us. I mean, mistakes happen but just a heads up would've been nice. In summary, I can ignore bad attitudes/hospitality when I have delicious food on my plate. Â Will definitely be giving this place another shot.",1
1535,4,4,9/7/2014,"Very reminiscent of the bistros of Paris or your average French town. Charming owners and great, moderately priced menu of bistro favorites. Nothing special in terms of decor (in fact, don't look too closely), but that is part of its charm. Packed to the gills with local characters from the Murray Hill neighborhood. The food was wonderful and the wine list was simple and inexpensive (just like in France).",1
1536,4,5,9/4/2014,"I took my husband here for his birthday and we really can't wait to come back! We don't go out to Murray Hill much as it wasn't really our scene, but I loved, loved everything about this restaurant. I love how authentic it is. I love the cozy, bistro feel, and how everything is so tight you can barely move from one table to another. Intimate, one would say. I love that everything feels authentic. And you know what, they do one freaking mean steak frites! The fries are not greasy and perfectly crisp. The sauce on the steak was perfect. And the cook and temperature of my steak was perfect and consistent. I just have a preference that I like to cut my own steak, and they pre-cut the steak, but that's just a me thing. And absurdly affordable for the quality of the food they serve too! We are definitely coming back!!!",1
1537,4,4,9/2/2014,They gave great affordable french food. Their service isn't the friendliest but their food makes up for it. They weren't too happy when we did not order wine. Their desserts aren't too great. Come here for the food. I had the special of the day and it was great. My partner had the duck confit it was delicious. I'm definitely coming back.,1
1538,4,2,8/30/2014,Local bistro fare is good. But what the two french fellas and the food lack is any joie de vivre. Perfunctory service and no humour or smiles. So may other places where they at least seem glad you are there.,1
1539,4,4,8/30/2014,"This place was close to a friend's apartment and we decided it looked like a promising last-minute brunch spot. We were seated quickly, the service was very good (were attentive without hovering, didn't try to push us out the door like they do at some places), and the food was excellent. I had the goat cheese and pesto frittata, which came served on a bed of fresh greens and french fries, and a mimosa. It was all delicious, and there was so much food that I could only eat half! Total cost: $14.95 (+tax & tip). The space is a little cramped, but if you're a two- or four-person group, it's not an issue. Great, relaxed vibe and quality food. I'll be back!",1
1540,4,5,8/27/2014,"My boyfriend and I decided to have our date night here because we were in the mood for French food. Â We were seated immediately (although we got there around 6 pm) and our waitress was attentive but not overbearing. Â She also helped us decide what to order, which ended up being great choices--pan seared chicken with mashed potatoes and mushrooms, and parisienne mussels. Â I'm usually wary of ordering mussels but we loved them-not too fishy, great texture, and wonderful broth with fresh vegetables. Â The chicken was delicious too-it wasn't dry, was quite savory, and I picked it to the bone. Â Mushrooms complimented perfectly. Â Also, our waitress had us try the ""floating island"" dessert because we inquired about it, which I didn't end up finishing because it was too sweet for me. Â She brought us creme brulee instead and only charged us for one dessert! Â The only negative thing I could possibly say is that the bathroom was kind of icky. Â Otherwise, it's a small, intimate setting that's perfect for a date and the price is ideal. Â We will be returning.",1
1541,4,4,8/24/2014,"Le Parisien is a cute authentic French restaurant in Murray Hill. We went as a party of 5 for Sunday brunch which originally I heard was pretty packed. However when we went, there wasn't a crowd but we needed to all be present before we could be seated. We did the prix fixe brunch with entree and 1 boozy drink for $15. I ordered the Ham and Gruyere Omlette. It was very good but not anything special but it came with greens and french fries. The french fries were perfectly crisp but still had a bite. They definitely were the best part. The ambiance was very cute and the staff was authentically French (they spoke french with eachother). It's not the best with large parties since most of the seating is for 2 or 3 people.",1
1542,4,4,8/20/2014,We were the first at the door on a Sunday morning. Quaint little restaurant. Love the ambience! We had the poached egg with salmon gravlax and eggs benedict. Food came out quickly and was excellent! We stayed to sip our coffee and chat a bit but people kept clearing our table of everything on it and even attempted to take our unfinished coffee mugs. We hadn't been there long buy were asked to leave so that other customers could take our table. Maybe it's a New York thing? Would have been a 5 if it weren't for that ending.,1
1543,4,2,8/19/2014,"Eh. I probably went at the worst time possible: came here for Sunday brunch, waited like 40 minutes, was crammed into a table at a far corner. The place is not big to begin with, but it was so crowded and unbelievably loud, everyone at the table had to yell to hear each other. The food was pretty ordinary too. Not bad of a deal ($15 for a brunch dish) but the taste was was neither fantastic nor memorable. Nothing terrible happened, but the overall experience wasn't positive. There are so many better places in the city for brunch.",1
1544,4,4,8/18/2014,"Yes, I love this place. Â The food is awesome. Â Mussels are the best in the city. Â Steak frites wonderful. Â Salads are awesome. Â Fair prices and great wine. Â Excellent service every day from Anna. Â But, Monday is a different story service from that young French fellow. Â Talk about sounding arrogance, short and unfriendly.",1
1545,4,3,8/18/2014,"Neighborhood spot. Small, cozy, but not expensive. Â Mussels (any of the soup variety) are always good w/ plenty of soup for you to soak up the juice w/ bread. Â Good, crispy fries. Â The soups, tartar, duck - all pretty decent. Friendly people.",1
1546,4,4,8/18/2014,Had a pleasant dinner here recently. Not too crowded on a Friday night. Shared the grilled artichoke salad to start. I had the liver and onions. Everything was well prepared and the service was great. Would definitely eat here again if we are in the neighborhood.,1
1547,4,5,8/18/2014,"My husband and I tried to make the lunch reservation but we couldn't get thru to make a reservation. Left frustrated after several attempts of calling, we gave up and we wrote to Le Parisien via Yelp to express our frustration with the relay call. Later, we got the call from the owner. He was apologetic and explained that he didn't realize that we are deaf customers. Â He went far to get in touch with us by relay service and reserved our lunch time. That tells us that he truly cares about his customers! When we arrived at the place, the owner approached us and apologized to us again and welcomed us then escorted us to the table by the window. The dishes looked beautiful and artistic. We really enjoyed the food tremendously. The place is small but cozy. Our experience is quite positive! We definitely will return again! Thank you, Le Parisien for making our day so special to celebrate our first anniversary of marriage!",1
1548,4,4,8/16/2014,"Went here for dinner. Having lived on French food for years I was craving something French. The steak frites hit the spot! Not like a dry steak but with sauce and caramelised onions. French fries were amazing. And my husband had the moules marinieres (mussels). Which were also really good. The waiter just did not understand/forgot to give the lid of the pot back after he emptied it of all the mussel shells. Service is perhaps for American standards a tad rude, but hey you're in a French bistro:) Tarte tatin could be a bit improved though. I have had better. All in all, forget your juice diet and enjoy their good food! Will definitely return.",1
1549,4,5,8/13/2014,"Great food, really cute atmosphere. Intimate setting, perfect for a date without getting over-the-top fancy.",1
1550,4,5,8/12/2014,"Great food, outstanding service. We came here the night of our engagement and have been back several times since and it never disappoints. Cute, tasty, affordable. Highly recommended!",1
1551,4,4,8/11/2014,"Arrived here a quarter to twelve on a Saturday. There were about 3 tables waiting ahead of us. I had poached eggs with salmon & my husband had the croque Monsieur - they were both fantastic and you can't beat the 14.95 brunch pre-fixe which includes a coffee, OJ, or a b-fast cocktail. Can't wait to come back!",1
1552,4,4,8/11/2014,"Great little restaurant! Â Was thrilled to have made a reservation as at 8pm the place was bustling and it is not very big. Â As others have pointed out - it's cozy but not cramped - relaxed and jovial atmosphere. Â The menu is typical bistro fare with a few special items. I had a the steak tartare which was very good, flavorful but not overkill, and a tarte tatin which was delish! Totally affordable too! Â We ended up paying $120 for 2, 3 courses, and 3 glasses of wine.",1
1553,4,4,8/7/2014,"I had an enjoyable brunch here; it has a nice, cozy, casual French cafe feel. They have a fixed brunch menu that includes an entree + your choice of coffee, sangria, or mimosa. There's a wonderful selection to choose from and I ended up having the Salmon Benedict, while my friend ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich. We both had a sangria each. My Benedict came with a side of seasoned fries, and my friend's sandwich was topped with a bunch of greens.. both dishes were overall very good! I would come back here for another brunch date.",1
1554,4,5,8/4/2014,"Food is awesome with big portions. We ordered mussels, and two main courses. Initially we also wanted to order two appetizers but the waiter has kindly reminded us not to. The mussels are very juicy, with smoked duck and tomato sauce, it's among one of the best I have ever tried! Prices very reasonable!",1
1555,4,5,8/4/2014,"Cutest little french bistro in murray hill (of all the places!). We walked in on a busy Thursday night (after being quoted a 1.5 hour long wait at Cask next door) and were able to score a table immediately. I loved their wine carafes which were moderately priced and much less intimidating than ordering a whole bottle. Food was phenomenal. Literally everything we ordered was delicious to the last bite. But whether you get anything else or not, you must must must order the escargot. Holy moly.. I think I licked every snail shell clean! YUM!",1
1556,4,2,7/23/2014,Had the duck liver pate and was disappointed. It was dry and just was not full of the taste that one would expect. Persons in my party complained about the steak being tough. Had the duck confit which was ok. Don't think the restaurant deserves the 4 star rating it has on Yelp,1
1557,4,4,7/23/2014,"My go to brunch for my neighborhood. Having discovered this magical place after being told of a 2 hour wait at Penelope, Le Parisien seated my friend and I no problem, and even gave us free mimosa refills since it was near the end of brunch hours. They have all the typical standard brunch foods but no place nearby can beat their French fries, these thin sticks of potato is fried to perfection. I'm sad to see the grilled portobello mushroom pesto sandwich off their brunch menu, but I did get to enjoy their amazing smoked salmon eggs Benedict. Hmmmmm yolkporn as my friend likes to call it. It was just what we needed. The place is small and quaint, so I'd advise to come early for brunches. I can't wait to go and try their dinner menu, everything just sounds so delicious.",1
1558,4,4,7/23/2014,"BRUNCH! Scrumptious, heavenly, all that is right in world with this new amazing spot I have just discovered! I have nothing but amazing things to say about this quaint gem! No reservations taken, but my brunch date and I walked in around 12:15 to find only 4 tables taken, but by the time we had gotten our drinks, and ordered, the place was packed. Things to Note As Pertaining to Ambiance: 1. Place is small, so if you want a table, come with a small party, 2-4 people, no bigger. If you are looking to bring a bigger party, pick another place, ideally speaking, or get there at 12 SHARP! 2. Even if you are a party of 2, still get there before 12:30 if you want to secure a table (they open at 12 for brunch). 3. Very intimate setting, you will hear the conversation next to you and a few other conversations in the area, and if you are claustrophobic I would avoid it as well. 4. The place itself, as I said, earlier is a quaint little spot in midtown, but secluded enough to miss the busy rush of the city feel. A little getaway, if you will. OKAY ON TO THE FOOD - Free brunch drink if you order an entree. We ordered the Sangria, which was good, although it was hard to eat the fruit because the oranges still had peels on them, which would be my only complaint. I would love this place EVEN more if they had a boozy brunch.... ALAS! I ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict with Ham and Hollandaise sauce and my brunch date ordered the Poached Eggs with Salmon Gravlax on English Muffins with Hollandaise sauce. We both, MULTIPLE TIMES, commented on how the eggs benedict, and salmon poached eggs just melted in our mouths, and dare I say it, THE BEST EGGS BENEDICT WE HAD EVER HAD! YES YES YES YES YES! IT WAS HEAVENLY and neither of us wanted it to end. And of course because we are both fat asses in our own right, we ordered the Fluffy French Toast with warm vanilla maple syrup with apple compote (which also ended up having bananas) - WHICH WAS FABULOUS, but as it was slightly burnt on one of the sides, and could have been slightly fluffier, but still really really delicious, I'm gonna -1/2 star for that. The service was great throughout the meal, helpful, yet unobtrusive, but I just thought the tables were a little tight and hard to maneuver around, even to get out of the booth, the whole table needed to be moved -1/2 star for little to no room, just felt cramped, esp after they seated someone basically so close to us that I could almost touch shoulders to the person on my left and right. Overall though great experience, and definitely come for the EGGS BENEDICT! Such a fan of this place, that I am putting it on my list to try for lunch and dinner sometime soon! TOTAL WIN!",1
1559,4,3,7/23/2014,"Really cute and intimate spot. A friend and I had dinner early here (6pm) and were lucky to get the table by the front window so we weren't crammed in tight next to other tables. It got packed around 7or so and though the wait staff was friendly, I felt rushed. It's really small so the volume gets pretty loud and not really a place where you can sit for awhile to catch up with friends. We split the artichoke salad as an appetizer which was really nice - greens with warm roasted artichoke, cherry tomatoes in a lemony vinaigrette. Nice and refreshing. I had the special of the day - cod with cauliflower emulsion sauce and a side salad of roasted cauliflower. The cod was cooked very well but the sauce was a bit too thick and rich for me. The side salad was also salty. I tried a piece of my friend's skate and it was tasty. We split the apple tart with ice cream for dessert and it was just OK. Good that it was not too sweet but I was expecting more of a crust and it looked like it was just baked apples with some glaze on top.",1
1560,4,4,7/21/2014,food is pretty good. very hole in the wall place. my friend got the mussels and says it was amazing and he got double the amount of mussels he usually gets. so it was a lot of mussels. I got the chicken and it was delicious too though I was still hungry afterward. but I do eat a lot...,1
1561,4,5,7/18/2014,"My girlfriend and I were saying overnight in the Murray Hill area and we were looking for a place to celebrate some good work news. Although I found it a bit strange that she wanted to eat French food in NYC (as she is French and lives in Paris), we stopped by this cozy dinner place. We had a wonderful meal of moules mariniÃ¨re, steak frites, and tarte tatin. Very intimate setting with great decor and all the atmosphere of Paris on East 33rd. The only downside is that you can't eat outside and people watch.",1
1562,4,2,7/15/2014,"Went here for the second time and it wasn't as good as I remembered. Ordered the pasta, steak frites, mussel appetizer and two drinks. Overall just underwhelming. Total bill including tip came out to lil over 100$. Maybe people go because it's the only bistro in the area.",1
1563,4,5,7/13/2014,"Ahhhh.... Paris... city of light... and love. Wonderful anniversary dinner with the hubby. We have made our marriage stronger by coming to places like Le Parisien. It's not fancy, or pretentious... but it's obvious that this is where people come to indulge in fine French cuisine and libation. We shared a 1/2 carafe of 2012 red from Cotes du Rhone. Dry and delish. The ambiance is very low key and relaxed. (Just what you want when you've been married to someone for 7 years!) The menu was spectacular. Escargot cooked in parsley, garlic... and butter... if I could only order one thing from this place, it would be that and the crusty bread that accompanies it. For our main courses, we had the pan roasted chicken and the duck confit. The mushrooms and sauce on both these dishes were so good and flavorful! We had to be tacky and try the fries... I mean it's internationally known as the ""French"" fry... and they were so light and crispy and salty and downright tasty! Then we had to compromise on the dessert... Profiteroles with ice cream or the ""Floating Island"" (Meringue sitting afloat on vanilla bean custard.) My hubs wanted the Profiteroles and I wanted the Floating Island... but being our anniversary and my husband usually letting me have the dessert I want every other time we go out to eat during the year... I... ahem... I mean, ""we"" agreed on the Profiteroles... :) Surprisingly the waitress came out with both! She said, ""The Floating Island is on the house, Happy Anniversary."" Her name was, Ana, and she was such a sweet waitress throughout the entire meal... we were honored to be served by her... and I was personally happy that she eavesdropped on our lil dessert debacle. :) Both desserts were good, but I was partial to the Floating Island because of the textures and full vanilla bean flavor that they seemed to just ""pop"" in your mouth... it was also a little sweeter since it was an anniversary gift from them. ;)",1
1564,4,4,7/10/2014,"I haven't had much French food, but their escargot was deliciously garlicy with a strong pesto flavor and my duck confit was juicy and fall-off-the-bone good. Â I basically had to restrain myself from gobbling everything down in a matter of minutes. Â However, the price to portion ration was a bit high for me, but I didn't mind quite as much since the food was good. Â  As a side note, the service was a bit spotty despite the restaurant being so tiny.",1
1565,4,3,7/7/2014,All I can say is that they must have offered decent food and service Â - because one day later I couldn't remember what I ate or how the service was...,1

1568,4,5,6/22/2014,"Best meal I had in New York. We order multiple dished including the chicken and the mussels. Everything was perfect. The best creme brulee that I have every had. The service was very good and it was packed. I highly recommend that if you are in New York, you must dine here.",1
1569,4,4,6/21/2014,"This is an adorable little restaurant in the Murray Hill area. We came here for brunch and really liked the ambiance and food. The interior is adorable, but it does get very cozy. There's not a lot of room here, and it would be difficult to get more than a group of 4 in here. It gets reasonably busy on the weekend, but not so much that there's a long line. The interior is decorated with vintage French posters and ceiling fans that give off a nice vibe. On nice days they open up the front so it's almost like dining in a patio, but be warned there is no air conditioning. They have a really nice brunch menu - most of the options are fixed price, and come with a entree and your choice of mimosa, OJ, sangria, or coffee (if I remember correctly additional glasses were 5$). The eggs benedict I had was delicious, and everyone else's dishes looked delicious too - the omelettes were plump but the salmon benedict really stole the show. Service is a little slow since it seems like they only have one waitress and one cook, but it makes for a nice leisurely brunch. Great, cozy restaurant with a very nice vibe!",1
1570,4,4,6/16/2014,This is a great neighborhood staple. I've been coming here for a long time and everytime it's good. It dos get very crowded so I do recommend making a reservation.,1
1571,4,5,6/15/2014,Went there for brunch ! Salmon eggs Benedict is yummi ! It is a great quality and quantity for the price. They had good sangria and coffee ! Service is good and the place has an old European retro look ! The only thing I didn't like was the fact that they don't serve dessert on brunch.,1
1572,4,5,6/14/2014,"Went for dinner on Saturday night. The place is small and wasn't full,so I thought I might have made a mistake. The place looks like a Parisien bistro in Paris. We were promptly greeted and seated. The hostess/waitress/owner? was cheerful and knowledgeable and made us feel at home. We picked a wine which was a delicious rose. For my appetizer I had the potato roasted garlic soup which was delish. Â My wife had the mussels which were simple and delicious. For entrees we opted for the liver (with an excellent wine reduction) that was cooked just right and juicy. My wife had the chicken which was also great. We both also had desserts. The deserts were simple good and expensive. All in all, simple delicious food. Reasonably priced except the desserts. Friendly and hospitable staff. I'd go back but get a dessert someplace. Still - 5 stats in my book.",1
1573,4,4,6/3/2014,"Excellent steak & frites!!! Very small place, about 6 tables in all and the food was delish!!! :) Will come again",1
1574,4,4,6/1/2014,"Its really hard to find a good place to eat around the midtown/murray hill, so this to me is a great find. Its a cute, humble lil' bistro, so groups of more than 4 will find it difficult to find seating, however they do take reservations. Â I had the french onion soup, and grilled chicken sandwich, while my friend had the croque monsieur (pretty big portion). The grilled sandwich was ok, but i was very pleased with the soup, came out very hot, and it turned out to be very hearty- highly recommended. The only negative thing i have to say is that the staffing is basically one waitress who is also the hostess. Â They could use some help. Â I'll be back though!",1
1575,4,1,5/30/2014,"I was looking for a spot on short notice and was happy to find an open reservation at Le Parisien. I showed up on time a short while later and was told it would be a 30 minute wait with no apology or explanation. My guess is this was a failure to coordinate Open Table with conditions at the restaurant, but sorry, that's not my problem. If you can't properly hold a reservation, you shouldn't waste the time of your customers by taking them.",1
1576,4,4,5/26/2014,"Le Parisien is one of my favorite spots in the neighborhood for brunch. It's only $14.95 for your choice of a brunch entree along with a beverage (mimosa, sangria, coffee, or oj). The fluffy french toast is my go to. It's topped with apple compote and bananas with warm vanilla maple syrup on the side. I'm also a fan of the scrambled eggs with cured salmon and chopped scallions. It comes with a small salad and fries. Their fries are thin and crispy and so good that I am always tempted to order another side of them.",1

1578,4,4,5/25/2014,"This place is tiny and the food is delicious. I had the thai mussels which were very good, several people in my group had other varieties of mussels and seemed to enjoy them. The mussels come with fries which I thought were too salty. The service was very good. My group really appreciated the free cocktails they let us sip outside since we had to wait a while because there was some mix up with our reservation",1

1580,4,4,5/24/2014,"This is a quaint little place in the Murray Hill-ish area. It was a nice surprise, with Parisian decor and little Eiffel Towers decorating the space. The quite strange thing, was that my friend and I were about the youngest people there...strange indeed. Let's move on to the food... escargot - deliciously pesto and buttery, and large! worth it, not over cooked in the least mussels espagnole - (with chorizo and tomato confit) delicious mussel pot served with frites, perfectly sized mussels and just the right amount of frites steak tartare - quite the portion size in the best way, the meat was fresh and the flavors were great...can taste the garlic, but not overwhelming, also served with frites creme brulee - the sugar crack topping could've been a little ""crispier"". it was good though. i only say this because i didn't hear the ""crack"" when my spoon broke through the sugar layer, great use of vanilla bean TLDR - great french restaurant with decent prices and good food.",1
1581,4,4,5/24/2014,"Best casual French restaurant in the city that I've had. Good for brunch, staff is relatively friendly, and the steak is done quite well. Does have that Parisian air and yet doesn't overdo it.",1
1582,4,5,5/21/2014,"I totally agree with all the other yelpers, indeed this one is a great find!! Every year around this time, my wife and I have this craving for typical french bistro food from our honeymoon. We have been looking for a whole in the wall, straight to the point, no frill french bistro food. Food was excellent!! It was as good as the one that we had during our honeymoon. So here's what we order: Escargot-on point, and excellent. I just wish for more french bread to soak up all the buttery, garlicky deliciousness...hahahahh (sorry...i'm a fatty who appreciates food!) Beef tartare- was amazing!! Seasoned on point! Steak frites-was so awesome, sauce was good. I asked for rare and guess what..i recieve my rare steak... Duck confit-was super crispy, a bit salty but thats okay you have the salad that counters it. After all the food that We ordered plus a bottle of 2011 bordeaux, the damage was less than $150 (tax&tip included).. Overall, when you're in NYC...give this place a try...my recommendation go during weekday and make reservation, like a said they're small... Bon appÃ©tit!",1
1583,4,1,5/20/2014,"I ordered french onion soup, escargots and pork special of the day. The french onion soup was lukewarm.. Soups are supposed to be burning hot, especially french onion soup that is covered with cheese. Because it was lukewarm, the cheese was nowhere near gooey. Escargots were too small... They were legit the size of my pinky nail. The pork special was too thin and too sour because they put too much lemon and capers... I was really excited cause i thought i found a nice french restaurant, but this one was really really disappointing.",1
1584,4,4,5/19/2014,Small and cozy Parisian restaurant - a bit too small for my taste but it was still manageable. The mussels are a definitely must-try! They tasted fresh and flavorful with the garlic and white wine. It's a simple and classic touch that compliments well with the fishy-ness of the mussels. We also got the steak frites and an extra star for extra fries. Tip: make reservations! The place is small and it was packed on a weeknight!,1
1585,4,4,5/19/2014,"You definitely have to make a reservation at this place. A group of four showed up right in front of us and were turned away, luckily we had thought ahead. I like that you can make the reservations over Yelp. The restaurant itself is pretty tiny, yet they manage to fit a lot of people in it. This leads to some of the areas being very crowded, we originally were seated elbow to elbow with another couple, but the hostess asked us to move to make room for another party. While this was a tad annoying, it put us in a more spacious corner table. The decor is a lot of posters and pictures framed, once again the walls look crowded, I'm sure they could make the room look bigger with different paint, but they have tried with some huge mirrors that I liked. The vibe it gives off is more traditional than trendy. The dining room was a little bit loud, but not roaring or anything. We chose this place because the food was a bit cheaper, but still a nice restaraunt. I had the duck, and my fiance had the steak. I loved my duck, it was flavorful, tender, and the mushrooms and potatoes that came with it were delicious too. I hated the salad though. I only wish the piece of duck was bigger, like most places serve it. The steak seemed to be more about the marinade/sauce as opposed to a really nice steak. It was still tender, and it definitely was flavorful. Overall that was nothing amazing. The fries were nice and thin and crispy though. I wish that the dessert menu was more extensive, it had four things on it. We had to google the names of all of them. We ended up having something that was like a cream puff but with icecream. We loved it with the warm fudge. There was two puffs so enough for both of us. The reason it gets four stars instead of five is because of the small space, decor, mediocre steak, and the fact that our server rarely came back. There was only three people on staff, so I get it. But we felt like nobody was paying attention to us. :(",1
1586,4,4,5/17/2014,You cannot get a better deal that Â brunch during weekends. $14.95 for great eggs Benedict with mimosa/sangria or coffee. Â The service was really good. The place is small and a little bit outdated but good food!,1

Â So immediately I go to opentable.com and I was able to find a table for 7:30pm and made reservations. Â After going back inside I told the owner that I was able to get a reservation, and he immediately instructs his staff to cancel the reservations because they were full. Since we had a kid who was with us (well mannered, I might add) the owner did not want to seat us. Â  If you were full why did you have a few open tables, and no one outside your door?

The food there was just so blend! The taste is just close to average. Calf liver was disappointing because the sauce completely covered up the natural taste of the calf. Mussel is ok, not impressive at all. With the food quality, it certainly did not deserve the high $20 price range. Most important of all, it doesn't really taste like friend cuisine, but more like American-want-to-be-French...",1

We started with the escargot, which was just as good as I remember it from Paris, and the garlic herb butter was perfect for bread dipping afterwards. For entrees, my friend had the duck confit, while I had the bistro steak frites. I liked the salad that the duck confit was served with. I loved everything about my steak! It was juicy and super tender, and even the french fries were perfect. To top it off, we had the profiteroles, which was a perfect way to end the meal with something small and sweet.

Â They are always such a treat to get at a restaurant when they are prepared well, and the ones from Le Parisien are ones I would order again. Â Both the texture and the seasoning were perfect. Â The only problem I had was that there weren't enough in the order . . . I could have eaten twice as many as they served. Â Next time I'll just get two orders. Â  Our entree was bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin. Â Some restaurants over-cook pork, leaving me wishing I had ordered the other white meat. Â The pork tenderloin at Le Parisien was cooked perfectly, and brought out of the kitchen piping hot. Â I savored every juicy bite of it during my meal. Â The portion size was also perfect for splitting, but please take into account my date and I are not huge portion eaters. Â You may just want to enjoy this whole dish on your own if you order it. Â  I'll look forward to my next opportunity to visit Le Parisien. Â @ bientot!",1
1598,4,3,4/3/2014,"Le Parisien is a good standby restaurant. Â Not bad, but not too good. Â Very good service, and a small, but good wine list. I had a pear & endive salad and a roast chicken entry. Â Both were real and good, but again, not great. Â  The main flavor I tasted on the chicken was chlorine, which is surprising because of the excellent quality of New York City water. Â  The restaurant is small and crowded by French and US standards (though normal by Italian standards) and a little loud, but still quaint. Â The cloth serviettes are actually kitchen drying towels... Kind of interesting. I won't return, not because the food is bad, but because there are so many other better and excellent restaurants in NY City.",1
1599,4,4,3/30/2014,"Not the most beautiful restaurant you'll find but definitely a neighborhood gem. Le Parisien resembles a cute rustic French cafe. And for brunch, only $14.95?! Oh yes, please!!! Your brunch entree comes with either a glass of mimosa, sangria or a cup of joe. And them fries though... Crisped perfectly. Ahhhh, heaven! Worth the exploration if you're in Midtown East!",1
1600,4,4,3/30/2014,The food was very good. I had the Thai mussels with fries and my husband had the steak and frites. Both were very good! We also shared the filet mignon carpaccio and I would DEFINITELY get that again! The actual restaurant was very small and very crammed but it didn't really matter once you got situated into your seat. The service wasn't really that friendly but I would go back for the food!,1
1601,4,5,3/28/2014,"What a wonderful experience! Made a reservation for 8.30 on Thursday night, we walked into a packed restaurant but they had a table open for us. The place is very small(most likely an old apartment) nothing fancy, but don't let that fool you. The food coming out of that kitchen is fantastic! We tried, filet mignon appetizer which comes with a little arugula salad, it was great. My fiance got steak and fries. I tried his meat and it melted in my mouth, it was also marinated(i think) so it was flavorful as well. I got duck confit - also very good but I would get the steak next time since it was divine! Desert was the most decadent creme brulee! to die for. Don't know about you but I am coming back to this place!",1
1602,4,4,3/26/2014,"Cozy French restaurant - make a reservation and you'll get seated almost straight away. We got escargot, duck confit, and mussels. Good portions, didn't taste Americanized. Waiters/waitresses were attentive. Just that it could get a little cramped in there because the place is so small.",1
1603,4,4,3/25/2014,"Attentive owners ensured our glasses were never low and our bellies were perfectly full. Â Just lovely. Â Cozy environment, beautiful dishes (try the filet mignon carpaccio) and great crowd. Â Will be back! Â :)",1
1604,4,5,3/23/2014,"We had a great diner, nice wine, amazing duck breast, and mussels Parisienne. Cute little cozy place, got full by 7 pm. Would recommend.",1
1605,4,5,3/17/2014,"A little on the pricey side, but the food at Le Parisien makes it worth it. I ordered the pan-seared half chicken and it was one of the most delicious decisions I've made recently. The portions were decently sized, especially compared to like restaurants. The ambiance was lovely and the restaurant was neither too loud nor too dark. Overall, great experience and even better food.",1
1606,4,3,3/15/2014,Very cute spot and good for a date. It is extremely small which makes it a date move. The food was pretty good. Definitely will go back eventually.,1
1607,4,4,3/10/2014,"Comfy & cozy, despite the tight quarters and crowd. Went for NYE 2014 prix fixe dinner. Food was better than expected.",1
1608,4,4,3/7/2014,The food was fantastic! The service was great and friendly bit with a rush. The place is realy small so it is a bit noisy when it's crowded.,1
1609,4,3,3/5/2014,"TL;DR: Skip brunch and come for dinner instead. Went for brunch at the behest of my girlfriend, but we came out slightly disappointed. Not that anything was wrong, but it was just really basic standard brunch fare with barely any French items (we got the Croque Monsieur and Egg White Omelette). Really wanted to like this place since its not too far from my apartment, but it was just nothing special! +1: With any brunch entree, get a choice of complimentary coffee (unlimited refills) / mimosa / OJ / sangria! It may have felt a little like Paris, but the food was just c'est OK!",1
1610,4,3,3/5/2014,"Came here for my dad's birthday yesterday and left a little underwhelmed. We came here at 12 pm on a Tuesday and the owner didn't want us putting our bags on any other chairs. I mean there's no one in the restaurant. Is that necessary? We asked for bread and he would take it out of a big bag with his bare hands - some gloves would have been nice. To start, I had the broccoli soup which was a seasonal special and it came with truffle oil and wild mushrooms. Aside from the truffle flavor which I liked, the rest of the soup was really bland. I tried my brother's roasted beet salad and thought it was very tasty. For my entrÃ©e, I had the skate which was decent but the butter lemon sauce was super heavy and creamy. My dad ordered the steak frites and he really wanted it grilled like how they do it in France. However, this was more of like a stew the way it was cooked. My brother enjoyed his grilled portobello sandwich. Overall, I would say while the food was decent, I don't think I would return since it's extremely cramped and nothing spectacular.",1
1611,4,3,3/5/2014,"Finally made it here for dinner and I left disappointed. It's one thing to be in a cramped loud place for brunch, but it's a whole other story for dinner. My boyfriend and I were thisclose to the two tables next to us and it was loud and just kind of disjointed. I didn't feel relaxed during the meal and didn't feel like we really had the chance to catch up. Bummer! The food itself was just okay. I got the grilled artichoke salad and the steak tartar and my boyfriend got the French onion soup and the duck. The artichoke salad had a weird taste to it that I can't place and definitely didn't like. The artichokes themselves were yummy though. The steak tartar was eh. Maybe I just don't like steak tartar? I haven't ordered it in awhile. I tried the duck and that was really good. Should have gotten that. The wine was also good. All in all, I definitely won't be coming back here for dinner. Possibly brunch again, but only if its convenient. Sounds like they raised their prices on that too!",1
1612,4,4,2/25/2014,"Lovely French restaurant with a great brunch menu. We came and were delighted to see the prefix menu~ brunch for $14.95. Done! We wanted to try something new. Live on 55th and Lex, hopped on and off the subway and wandered until we found this little treasure. He got poached eggs with salmon. I got the eggs Florentine. Both came with a spinach salad and french (ha) fries. The fries were perfect. The rest was pleasant. The mimosa was short and sweet. We came right at noon when we were the only people there. Within minutes the entire place was bustling with folks. Friendly staff. Clean bathroom. Food came quickly.",1
1613,4,4,2/25/2014,"One of the best kinds of neighborhood bistros you can find no matter where you live. One only wishes that their own version Le Parisien is across the street from them as a go-to dining spot that epitomizes reliability in quality and enjoyment. Not to mention extremely affordable. Excellent brunch options for under $15 is unheard of in Manhattan, and while other brunch destinations may leave you disappointed for their overhyped offerings, you know what you are getting here. Excellent egg dishes (florentine, omelette) and croque monsieur. Â Dinner is your standard bistro fare done well. French onion soup, mussels, steak frites, duck confit are all quiet winners that leave you happy. Feel free to complement that with an extensive wine list which is also very reasonably priced. It is hard to call a restaurant with 4-star, 384 reviews underrated, but it certainly feels that way here.",1
1614,4,4,2/24/2014,"You know a place has solid food when there's a French 90-pound little old (money) granny in a massive fur coat gobbling down monkfish like it's the last meal she'll enjoy on this earth. Cozy French ambiance, excellent service, and if the food is good enough for French granny, you're damn well going to enjoy it.",1
1615,4,3,2/23/2014,"Overall, we had a nice time. The restaurant is very small, but the food and service were good. The beet salad is excellent. And the waitress was able to suggest a delicious bottle of wine. The steak tartare is decent.",1
1616,4,4,2/23/2014,Great poached eggs w salmon; nice ambiance; small but with lots of character. space is really cramped but that's not a big deal in manhattan.,1
1617,4,4,2/22/2014,Great food great ambiance. We couldn't get a table the first time because it's always packed. Make sure you make reservation ahead of time!,1
1618,4,4,2/20/2014,Great for brunch. Nice environment. Somewhat small for a big group of people. But the food is great. No complaint there.,1
1619,4,4,2/20/2014,Went with my college age daughter to celebrate her studying next year in Paris. Good move. This is a neighborhood bistro that serves very good authentic French cuisine. Attentive and friendly staff. It's pretty cozy so don't expect privacy. On the other hand our fellow patrons were friendly and contributed to the ambiance. Not pretentious at all. We'll be back.,1
1620,4,3,2/20/2014,Great little french bistro in Murray hill. Prices are very reasonable and food was pretty good. I ordered the moules for my family to share and for entrees we had the steak and Duck confit. Both were pretty good but not exceptional. The duck was a little dry and the steak was not very tender but both entrees were dressed well with a delicious sauce to compliment the meats. It was a good meal and had a cute french bistro vibe. I would definitely come again for a casual date but not for a special occasion.,1
1621,4,4,2/16/2014,"Cute and petite. I took my girlfriend there for Valentines Day and the place was decorated with red balloons and lit by candles creating a cozy and intimate atmosphere. They had a special 3-course prie fix Valentines Day menu for $49 per person from which I ordered a celery soup, a pan seared salmon, and a banana tart. Everything was wonderful, nothing too fancy, simply well cooked french food. We also ordered a carafe of bordeaux which was excellent. As my girlfriend and I sipped our wines, surrounded by walls plastered with vintage french posters, and listened to the waiters and waitresses speaking french in the background, it almost felt like we were spending our Valentine's day in Paris... if it weren't for some members of the staff asking ""FINISHED? FINISHED? FINISHED?"" every five minutes. I understand that it was Valentine's Day and they are very busy, but that is why I made a reservation. Please let us enjoy our meal in peace next time.",1
1622,4,4,2/13/2014,"Le Parisien Bistrot is a cute little French bistro, it reminds me of the Paris cafes in France. The restaurant is very small, but filled with a lot character. We went there for brunch with a group of people. The wait wasn't too long, and service is good. The eggs benefit was really yummy, the egg was perfectly cooked; the egg was running down the Â ham and bread...so good. The french toast with vanilla maple syrup and bananas is esquisite! Loads of flavors and great pairing with the vanilla syrup and bananas. The Wild Mushroom omelete was alright, nothing spectacular. The steak sandwich is actually really good. This meal far exceeded my expectation.",1
1623,4,3,2/11/2014,Food was delicious here. Escargot is a must! Duck dish was pretty tasty too.,1
1624,4,5,2/10/2014,Delicious! We had the mussels (marniere and Parisienne). Much to my surprise they were very sizable portions. It might be easy to miss the door but once you're inside you'll feel warm and cozy.,1
1625,4,5,2/9/2014,"Food was great - ordered mussels, steak frites, and a bottle of wine for dinner. Ambiance - small restaurant, could get a bit loud. Service - very good.",1
1626,4,5,1/29/2014,"Le Parisien is the perfect little French cafe in a very American city. The place was small and quaint, with dim romantic lighting. The staff was very authentic in their French-ness, without exhibiting any of that infamous French attitude. I wouldn't even be able to blame them if they did, since my friend hadn't shown up till 20 minutes past our reservation. Now, when I say small, I mean you have to be prepared to share very intimate seating. The cramped space might have even added to the authenticity of the place. I like to think that perhaps the seating was designed with consideration of the slender and poised figures of the French, and not so much of the husky-bodied American. Regardless, you might have to shift your table around to get in and out, so it might be a good idea to use the restroom prior to getting situated. As for the food, it was DELICIOUS. My friend ordered the French Onion Soup and said it was a little bland, but that was her only complaint. She ordered the classic roasted chicken while i ordered the mussels with chorizo. Both were very delicious. I ended up forcing myself to physically consume the entirety of my dish even though it was huge. My body ached as i continued to eat past my limit, but i had no choice... my mouth overpowered my instinct, demanding i continue. I even went as far as soaking a few pieces of crusty brad into the broth of my mussels. Overall, my experience was fantastic. Will definitely be coming back for more.",1
1627,4,4,1/28/2014,I went last night for dinner. It's a tiny place with lots of character. You have to be okay with tight spaces - there's only a few inches between tables. The Skate fish was fantastic! I will be back again,1
1628,4,5,1/26/2014,"Stopped by for a quick bite to eat. I was in a rush, and only had a few minutes. Granted, the restaurant wasn't busy, but the food arrived super quick. The Sancerre as well as the food was excellent. Great portions; highly recommended.",1
1629,4,4,1/25/2014,"The deal for the brunch menu was awesome. $15 for drink (mimosa, coffee, etc) and a brunch item which comes with fries and salad. I thought the egg white omlette with salmon was pretty good. I am not really into fish, but the omlet itself was well cooked and seasoned. I loved loved the fries. Salad was pretty good too. The waiter seemed to be in a rush to get us out though. So I wish there was more time for the brunch.",1
1630,4,5,1/22/2014,"It's fantastic, nice atmosphere, Â great service. Â The mussels and the stack are amazing. Â Tried the brunch , it's great and they have a good deal for it",1
1631,4,4,1/17/2014,"Excellent. I can add little to positive comments that have been said before. The nonchalant server approach is pure French and should not be misread. This is Bistro style French cuisine at its best. With about 12 tables reservations are recommended. Try mussels, duck confit, salads and Floating Island desert. Short wine list but well selected...try the Sancerre!",1
1632,4,4,1/12/2014,"What a charming French bistro! We stopped by on a week day after failing to get a table at another place nearby. We saw a full house and a decent wall of wine so we had to step in. This bistro has a charming quality to it: quaint enough to let it be a date night without giving the impression of ""trying too hard."" The seating area is pretty small, especially since one end of it is wall-to-wall glass. You may rub elbows with the party next to you. We tried the Bistrot Steak Frites with Red Wine Thyme Sauce with Shallots and the Duck Confit with Crispy Potatoes, Wild Mushrooms and Frisee Salad. Both dishes were delicious and components fresh. Steak was cooked perfectly and the duck confit was tender and flavorful. Overall, a pleasant surprise in terms of food and ambiance.",1
1633,4,4,1/10/2014,"Great place but small. Really good food. Had the duck, beet salad, mussels. Came here after the movies at kips bay. Pleasantly surprised.",1
1634,4,3,1/9/2014,"The food and wine was all delicious. We enjoyed two fantastic entrees and a delicious profiterole dessert. My only criticism is that the waitstaff was a bit off-handed. My friend and I are in our early twenties, and it seemed like we were being talked down to for asking about wine recommendations, favorite desserts, etc. All in all, we would definitely go back, but not for the service.",1
1635,4,4,1/4/2014,"Truly good french food, for a (for new york) reasonable price. This is the kind of place you bring that special family member you want to impress :D",1
1636,4,5,12/27/2013,We picked this restaurant based on yelp. The escargot was as good as what I remember from France. My husband ordered the mussels and received a HUGE pot of mussels. They were really good and he filled up because there were so many. He said he never expected to fill up from an order of mussels - it happened. I ordered one of the nights specials - coq au vin - it was superb! Also a big plate; I ate until I just couldn't anymore. A very quaint restaurant. Get a reservation as there are not a lot of seats. We will definitely be going back here!,1
1637,4,3,12/27/2013,"Great neighborhood French bistro, with friendly service and a cozy atmosphere. Â We shared the endive appetizer (loved that they cut up the pieces very well), the duck confit and the mussels (can't recall the name, but first item on the mussel menu). Â  The duck was a bit overdone ... I like it when the confit is a bit tough to chew, but it was very flavorful. Â The mussels were very fresh, but perhaps needed to cook longer, as the onions were still a bit raw. Overall, yummy food and a nice pleasant dining experience!",1
1638,4,5,12/26/2013,We had our xmas eve dinner there. It's such a cozy place to hang out with friends and family. Nice food and affordable. Recommend.,1
1639,4,4,12/24/2013,"I loved this place. Great food, nice ambience. The owner seemed to have much pride in the quality of the food they provide. Recommend!",1
1640,4,5,12/22/2013,"Le Parisien is not posh, but is absolutely perfect for what it is - really great food and very friendly and helpful service. The menu contains basic French bistro food, and it was all very well executed. Fantastic duck confit. While in NYC we went to fancier places, but none less memorable. We'll be back.",1
1641,4,4,12/13/2013,"Went to Le Parisien for a date last night and this restaurant definitely lived up to it's reviews! Â Everything we had was delicious. Â The escargot was very tasty and presented very well. Â The pot of muscles (garlic and white wine) was an extremely generous portion. Â The steak frites were cooked exactly as we had ordered and had a delicious, rich red wine flavor. Â Even the wine was surprisingly better than expected. The restaurant itself is very small and has a cozy atmosphere. Â We had a reservation for 8:30 and were seated right away. Â The only negative on the night was that our table was within two feet of the door, so each time anyone came or left, we felt a huge gust of wind. Â Besides this (which was tolerable as the restaurant was packed and we did not have to wait) the meal was essentially flawless. Will definitely be back to Le Parisien!",1
1642,4,4,12/12/2013,Pretty good food. Â Great ambience. Â Good service. Â This is a fun neighborhood spot that is definitely worth a try.,1
1643,4,3,12/10/2013,"i would say its more like 3 1/2 stars. Â really difficult to rate this place. I'm mixed with rating the service. Â the waitress was really confident with the food and will not recommend anything because everything is "" great"". Â oooookay. Â she was really nice about me sitting there for a while waiting for my friend who was late without making a big deal out of it. thank goodness it was a horrible snowy night. Â the waitress was efficient and checked in on us regularly which was nice. Â I can see how this place can get too overwhelming because of its tiny space and the many patrons. Â we ordered the escargot, pate, bistrot and frittes, fish special in a bouillabaisse and duck confit.. Â as expected : tasty escargot. my friend loved the pate. Â i enjoyed the duck confit though really tiny portion. Â just a small piece of the leg but great flavor. i don't mind it being a little dry but some people may have issue with this. i happen to enjoy the crispiness of the skin when I go to duck. Â the fish special was fine but did not blow my mind though. Â though the steak had a great authentic flavor but would have preferred a better cut of steak since I was chewing it longer than I would like. should have ordered the steak tartar looking back. Â the atmosphere was really nice and I can see how people say it reminds them of Paris. just go when you know it won't be too crowded.",1
1644,4,2,12/9/2013,"I came for lunch and had an omelette and coffee. Â Neither was good. Â This place came highly recommended from a good friend whose taste I trust so I would give it a second chance if the opportunity presented itself, but I'm in no rush to make a second reservation.",1
1645,4,2,12/8/2013,it was my birthday and they did absolutely nothing to make me feel happy/special. they were fine aside from running about 20 minutes late. they're french in attitude and service. the food is good. this place is certainly overrated.,1
1646,4,4,12/8/2013,"So much better than expected. And, dare I say it: so much better than current state of bistro fare in Paris itself. The bread was terrific -crusty on the outside, moist and chewy on the inside. We both had the soup of the day which was an excellent squash soup laced with dark green streaks of extra virgin olive oil. I thought it was a little under-salted but my husband didn't (and we are usually on the opposite sides on this.). I had the mussels in white wine and garlic which came with plump fresh mussels in a terrific broth (the bread came in handy once the mussels were gone -mmmm) and good skinny fries. My husband, who'd just come back from Paris, had ""pan roasted"" chicken with string beans and potato puree. He loved it. He said he'd tried four different times to find this meal in Paris but, unlike years past, had not succeeded in finding it. We will definitely go back. The restaurant was small (and the tables quite close together) so reservations would be smart. They apparently have a prix fixe brunch on both Saturday and Sunday we know nothing about but seems like it might be a good deal. (advt price was $14.95)",1
1647,4,5,12/7/2013,"I made a reservation for 2 at 5:45pm on a Wednesday night, since all the previous reviews recommended I do so. We were the first in the restaurant but it quickly filled up moments later. It's a small place, but not stuffy and quite affordable. There aren't many restaurants I would return to, but this is one of them. There is a giant chalkboard at the front with a selection of wines by the glass, 1/2 liter, and bottle. Steak tartare came with a raw egg in a half shell and french fries. Duck confit came with crisp, out-of-this-world potato slices. You get your greens here too. Food was amazing. I was in the zone until he said, ""Bebe... you ate all the duck..."" I looked up, mortified, and could only respond pathetically, ""...but I gave you the last potato..."" There will be more duck. I guarantee it.",1

1651,4,5,12/2/2013,"Definitely surpassed my expectations! The food was good the service was great. My favorite us the soup and calves liver. Of course, calves liver is an acquired taste. The waiter came back occasionally to make sure everything is alright and made sure they didn't disrupt our conversation. The place is really small though, so make sure you make a reservation!",1
1652,4,5,11/30/2013,"My wife and 2 kids went here on a Monday. As most others mentioned, we needed reservations. There are maybe 4 tables for 4 in the entire place. The decor really does put you in mind of Paris. A little cramped, but fairly quiet, just enough sound to give the feeling of energy. Â The waiter was patient in explaining some of the menu and wine selections. Service was quick, appetizers were out within about 5-10 minutes of our order. I imagine that they Â need to be efficient to turn tables in such a small place. I had the filet mignon carpaccio, really was tremendous, cut paper thin but packed with flavor. My wife was pleased with the French onion soup. Â  Entrees again pleased everyone, I had the duck confit, definitely 5/5, perfect seasoning and tender/crispy texture. My wife and son went with bistros steak frites both were happy, I thought it was 4/5 , just a little of burnt flavor on the outside., but very tender and the frites with red wine sauce were wonderful. Â I tried my daughter's pork tenderloin, also outstanding flavor (wrapped in bacon) and very tender. Â Desserts stole the show. The creme brule was 'the best I ever had' according to my wife, who has quite a number Â in her life. Â The shallow ramekins helped to balance the crunchy/creamy elements. Â My daughter wolfed down the profiteroles in no time flat, I didn't even get to sample it. My son was really into the apple tatin, and he's not even a big sweet eater - the apples were caramelized to perfection, with flavors from other fruits developing from the apple. Â  Â Just as pleasant an experience one could expect to have in Midtown Manhattan.",1
1653,4,5,11/27/2013,"Thanks to a Yelp reviewer I found a gem in the Murray Hill area.. Actually Leslie D.s review was the key! Thx you Leslie we loved it. We began w/ a nice Cote Du Rhone.....Chapelle St. Arnoux. A nice red not too dry wine recommended over a drier Bordeaux....you can find that wine at a number of online store....excellent ! Â I had the country patÃ¨....and we split that along w/ a rare filet from the appetizers. We also shared the white wine/ garlic pot of mussels ....very traditional. As an entree that we could have split either, I had the Duck Confit over potatoes and mushrooms and Lynne had the grilled trout over risotto w/ lime......OK, we kinda sampled the menu....LOL...this restaurant only seats a bit over 30. We loved it! That was Mon. night the 25 of Nov. our food was delis .......a crusty duck outside and perfectly moist and flavorful inside. I did taste the trout...I liked it as did Lynne. So, what was fab...the pate....mussels...oh well everything....and esp the mussels and wine....paid the bill, grabbed a cab and on to see Van Morrison at Madison Sq. Garden in the theater .....yay!",1
1654,4,4,11/25/2013,"First time for French food was a great experience! Had dinner here the other day, and have to say their half chicken with wild mushrooms and mashed potatoes is one of the most delicious dish I ever had. Escargot was a new taste too. Wine Steak and frites were decent though. I like the ambiance and coziness of the little restaurant, and prices were reasonable for French cuisine.",1
1655,4,4,11/25/2013,"Went here last night for dinner for the first time and it was pretty fantastic! I live in the neighborhood and was looking for a new place to get dinner before a movie Â I'm so glad I found this spot. It's quite small Â tucked away on 33rd St btwn 3rd Ave and Lex, but the ambience is part of its charm. You feel like you've walked into a true Parisienne cafe, it's very romantic, small dining room. Our table ordered a bottle of wine which and French onion soup (traditional and delicious), the beet salad and artichoke salad, both beautifully presented and fresh and very tasty. For dinner we had the roasted chicken (with the most crispy skin on the outside and juicy meat on the inside, yum!). The only thing we ordered that was not a perfect 10 were the Parisienne mussels, surprisingly. Not much flavor, very little broth to dip our bread and perfect French fries in. Everything else was fantastic! We will definitely be back for the brunch special they have on Sat. And Sun!!!",1
1656,4,4,11/20/2013,"Magnifique. ! The salads we had, roasted artichoke and endive with pear, were perfectly dressed. Â Mussels were delectable and the rarely found as such, skate, was sublime. Â So many restaurant s in NYC, but this one is worthy of numerous return trips. Â Did I mention the creme brulee? Perfect.",1
1657,4,5,11/18/2013,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday... What a treat! I live in the area, and have always had trouble finding something that is in Midtown, not packed with tourists, reasonably priced and charming. Is it really too much to ask? The store itself is quite small, seating is limited. However, I was seated immediately at 12:15pm on a Saturday. The lighting was just right, and the just the right amount of staff presence for a lovely girl (or romantic!) date. I ordered the egg white omelette with gravlax and herbs from the brunch prix fixe menu ($15.95 if I remember correctly?), which includes one drink of choice (coffee, OJ or sangria). Best egg white omelettes! Unlike the huge pillow of mushy bland tasting egg white that I usually get (at Jane, for example), this egg white was first flavored with herbs and then made into a ""pancake"" form before being wrapped around a very flavorful piece of salmon. I wish I could make these at home for breakfast.. and lunch.. and dinner... There was no whole-egg-envy :) Would definitely go back, especially with such reasonable price and convenient location. One of my new favorite brunch places... Midtown, or not!",1
1658,4,5,11/18/2013,What a great little date spot! This tiny little French bistro is hard to get into without a reservation but once you're in you'll enjoy authentic French fare in a cozy atmosphere. I had the steak frites and my husband had the lamb ragu special--both were excellent and perfectly portioned.,1
1659,4,5,11/16/2013,"LOVED this place! It is such a cute authentic fancy cafe looking french restaurant. The mussels (thai style) were just ok. I think I like my regular italian style mussels better. The frites were crispy and salty (just the way I like). The duck confit was AMAZING, with the tender duck meat and crispy skin, I could have eaten 10 servings, had a heart attack and died happy. WORTH IT. The Bistrot Steak Frites were TO DIE FOR. Well, I skipped the frites since I had it with the mussels. Instead, I had it with a mixed green salad (which was standard spring mix with whatever dressing they use.... But for some reason it was also really really good). It must have been the sauce. Not only was the steak ""melt in you mouth"" tender, the sauce was so good that, even though I ate everything on my plate, I wanted to ask for a container to bring the sauce home! I was considering trying to cook steak that weekend and pouring the sauce on it..... Or just drinking it for dessert. I LOVE THIS PLACE.",1
1660,4,4,11/13/2013,"Fantastic dinner! Highly recommend this restaurant! Great food, great ambiance, and great time!",1
1661,4,4,11/9/2013,"Unequivocally French. Very well curated wine list, laid-back atmosphere. There were so many mussels in the pot, I am shocked I finished them. Frites were fresh cut and delicious. Great little French go-to!",1
1662,4,4,11/6/2013,"Within walking distance of Pod 39, I tried Le Parisien and was not disappointed. Authentic and intimate, the food and service were first rate. Â Shared a salad and totally enjoyed Steak/Frites with a terrific sauce - cooked perfectly and the prices were quite reasonable by NY standards. I'll go back next time in NYC. Bravo! Vive Le Parisien!",1
1663,4,4,11/6/2013,"This is not some gourmet Michelin star restaurant, but in terms of authentic Parisian cafÃ©s, it's probably as close as you're going to get in manhattan. Highly recommended if that's what you're going for. Staff was very nice and food was great. Atmosphere is the best thing, which is what you should be coming here for.",1
1664,4,5,11/4/2013,Great dinner for a great price! Can't wait to come back again.,1
1665,4,4,11/1/2013,"Brunch: Delicious! Egg was perfectly cooked in my eggs Benedict, and the Hollandaise sauce was so tasty! Each of my individual French fries were perfectly crispy. How is that possible? French toast was amazing too. And very friendly people.",1
1666,4,5,10/31/2013,"Wonderful service, amazingly convenient location, lively atmosphere and reasonably priced. That being said, the food is the star! Â Appetizers, entrees and dessert... all were sublime. Â This place is a new fave.",1
1667,4,3,10/31/2013,"Soup, escargot and mussels were a 3.5 but the sancerre wine and ambience made up for the so-so food.",1
1668,4,4,10/30/2013,"Very cozy, good food at a reasonable price",1
1669,4,4,10/30/2013,"Excellent food. I can't tell you how authentic the food is, since I'm not sure what makes steak tartare and french fries more or less french....suffice, it was good. The meat and salad veer towards the sweet side but not overwhelmingly so...the french fries were...french fries. Cute, small, comfortable place. I think it's reflected well by the reviews.",1
1670,4,5,10/29/2013,I met my old boss for lunch yesterday. Â The steak frites was excellent -- the pommes frites especially. Â Nice selection of wines by the glass as well. Â A worthy successor in Murray Hill to the old Bienvenue on 36th between Madison and 5th.,1
1671,4,2,10/27/2013,I do not recommend this place. Far too many French bistros to settle here. The mussels Parisienne were very dry and the French fries too salty. The duck dry as well although the potatoes and mushrooms had a nice zing with the spices used. Ordered artichoke salad for entree artichokes lovely seasoned although a tad over cooked. Did not pair well with the dressing and arugula. This place was recommended by a friend since. Was in the Murray hill area. Thank you but no thank you. Too pricey for the quality of food.,1
1672,4,4,10/24/2013,"Le Parisien is a quaint bistro reminiscent of a small Paris cafÃ©. Â Start with the escargot and mop up the delicious green garlic sauce with plenty of bread that they bring to the table. Â I usually never order salads at restaurants because too many are uninspired and boring, but the endive salad was creative both in taste as well as presentation. Can't go wrong with mussels here-- I have tried the Parisienne and Espagnole and both are delicious and LARGE portions. The frites that come with the mussels are crispy and perfect for dipping in the sauce. The duck confit entrÃ©e was good but not great and quite a small portion, especially in comparison to the mussels.",1
1673,4,4,10/22/2013,"Le Parisien certainly lives up to its name; it does remind me of the casual Parisian food that I consumed while in Paris. My companion and I had the pate, steak frites, and salmon entrees. The steak was properly cooked to order with American-style doneness (i.e., a medium will not get you a French-style medium cooked steak, which is actually more of a medium-rare here in the states). The pate and salmon were as one would expect. Service is fairly snappy. Prices here are not bad at all considering the area of Manhattan that this establishment is located in. Seating is fairly cramped to the point where it is close to being a fire hazard in the legal sense, haha. Despite the lack of space between tables, we were able to hear each other just fine. Â  Reservations are an absolute must. I made one the night before for a Friday without a problem, but the restaurant was filled to its seams when we got there.",1
1674,4,5,10/21/2013,"I love this place! Â It is small and quaint and so authentic. Â I spent years living in France and am always looking for places that have that je ne sais quoi (ugh, I know...) and Le Parisien has it. Â We went there for dinner on a Friday and got a table by the window before the place filled up (and it fills up quickly!). Â Service was great, everyone working there was so friendly and attentive - you can tell they really care about what they are doing and have incredible pride in their food and service. Â Even the owner was waiting tables and clearing dishes. Â  The food is amazing and the menu is really decently priced. Â This is the real deal. Â I had the steak tartare and my boyfriend had the duck - both were out of this world. Â It is a place where you can have a great meal and a few drinks without breaking the bank. Â I have recommended this place to everyone I know!",1
1675,4,4,10/21/2013,"Have been here many times and the food is usually wonderful. Artichoke salad was wonderful. Â Carpaccio lacked the meat. Â it was hard to find under the salad, however what was there was tasty. Â Roasted chicken was a tad overdone. Creme Brulee divine.",1
1676,4,4,10/17/2013,"Been here twice and absolutely love it! I came here for the mussels and boy, they are no joke! So good! I literally craved their mussels after coming here the first time. I had the Parisinne first time and the Thai second time. While both were excellent, the Thai is by far the much tastier one. It had so much more flavor and the Thai spices really complimented the mussels. I know I know, it's a French restaurant, but trust me on this one, the Thai mussels are better than the Parissinne! The portion is quite big and it is served with a side of french fries...or should I say pomme frites? hahaha. The fries are alright, nothing too special. Atmosphere is great too. It's a cute little restaurant with about 10 tables. Quite cozy with cute French themed posters. I highly recommend this place! By far the best place I've been so far in the City for mussels!",1
1677,4,4,10/16/2013,"Husband and I yelped whatever French was nearby and Le Parisien came up and since it was one if the closer locations, we decided on this place. Great choice! We had no reservation but was seated right away (we got lucky!) the place is tiny. Ordered the duck pate for appetizers and we scarfed it down. Husband is not too fond of pate, but he liked this one. He ordered the bistrot steak frites, EXCELLENT!! We were both thoroughly pleased with his dish. I had the duck confit. It was delicious. But if I could choose, I'd order the steak frites. And for dessert, ordered the creme brÃ»lÃ©e. So amazing! Loved everything about this restaurant except the tiny space.",1
1678,4,5,10/15/2013,"We really enjoyed our dinner here. Great food, my arugula salad was especially good. We will be back.",1
1679,4,4,10/14/2013,"We arrived a few minutes early for our 8PM reservation; a very pleasant lady said there would be a short wait for our table. Â We waited outside as it was a pleasant evening and there is no space to wait inside. Â The beet salad and the pear salad were amazing and another guest with our party raved about the wild mushroom soup selection they offered that evening. Â The salmon and skate were deliciously prepared and perfectly done. Â The steak was tender and delicious, the sauce not overpowering. We will be back.",1
1680,4,4,10/14/2013,"Stayed in the Murray Hill neighborhood this weekend. My wife and I dined here on Friday night. We showed up a bit after 9:00 pm and were seated by 9:15. Definitely comparable to a Paris bistro based on how close together the tables are! I don't say this as a negative; I think it brings a charm to a place. It definitely invokes memories of our trip to Paris. Somehow Chez Denise at lunchtime was quieter, though. This place was quite loud. I ordered the soup du jour which was cream of wild mushroom. My wife didn't order a starter, but my soup was served with two spoons, without having to ask. Very nice -- and not unnoticed. I thought the soup was very nice, supple and velvety. My wife thought it was too thin. I saw it more as a dish for the working class, staying well shy of thick and cloying, rather than rich with butter and cream -- the kind of soup that puts sweaters on your teeth. These are expensive ingredients, and not always what you find in Parisian bistros. It was perfectly seasoned. For mains, my wife ordered the bistro steak frites (onglet, aka hangar steak), and I ordered steak tartare. I was a bit taken aback when the server asked if I knew what that was, like I was a rube. Maybe I look the part, I don't know. I guess there are folks that have ordered it and freaked out when raw beef showed up. Whatever. Anyway, it was a very good steak tartare. My only complaint would be the egg yolk. It was a very pale yellow, indicating to me the ""good eggs"" weren't used. The steak had that nice briny undertone you want, and was very fresh. It too was perfectly seasoned. And I think the portion was just right. My wife's dish was yet again, perfectly executed Paris bistro. We both had frites. I felt like they might have been slightly overcooked, but the flavor was just awesome. It's not too often I experience the sweetness that potatoes can exhibit. The flavor on these was just great. While I wish the wine list was a bit more broad, it offered some great selections, in particular some nice options from the RhÃ´ne. We went with the CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne, which was everything I expected. There was a lovely looking ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape on the menu I would have loved to try, but it was a bit rich for my budget that evening. Overall we had a great experience. Would definitely recommend.",1
1681,4,4,10/9/2013,"Legit French fare for a non-French price. Bona fide waiter, tasty but characteristically small portions. The duck confit was perfectly done. Delicious latte to cap off the night. I highly highly recommend!",1
1682,4,2,10/7/2013,Below average food and ambiance.,1
1683,4,2,10/6/2013,"The waiter was rushing us in and did not even care if we made a reservation or not. He seemed very uninterested in serving us when we decided not to drink. Mussels Marinieres was okay. A bit too salty, so I tried to eat with bread (a lot of bread). The french fries were super hard and juiced with smelly oil.",1
1684,4,5,10/5/2013,"We had a lovely meal in a very relaxed and comfortable environment. Â  The food was delicious, the service friendly and low key. Â All in all, I felt as though I was in Paris. Â I loved it, and look forward to going again. Â Thanks, Emil,for the recommendation!",1
1685,4,4,9/30/2013,"Intimate, romantic, authentic, small tables, brusque service ... felt like I was in Paris.",1
1686,4,5,9/29/2013,"really delicious-- we ordered escargot and the mussels espangole to start. heavenly. for our main courses my boyfriend ordered the duck confit and i got the poached salmon. loved every bite!! they don't make changes to the order, but when i mentioned my gluten sensitivity the server knew what i could eat and what i couldn't. they also serve wine in carafes if you aren't up for a full bottle of wine. highly recommend.... but you definitely need a reservation-- we did it online the day before and our two reasonable choices were 6 and 830... took the 6 and the restaurant was already packed.",1
1687,4,4,9/26/2013,"Thanks Yelp- I was meeting a dear old high school friend, and she was coming into the City via train, and asked if we could meet near Grand Central. Â I did a quick search on places near Grand Central, and came up with Le Parisien. Â  The short version of this place is don't judge a book by its cover- the restaurant is tiny, and frankly, it's a bit shabby (as is the bathroom, which is all of three steps from the dining room), and the service is authentically brusque (take the following exchange: ""I'll have coffee."" Â Delivered to the table: iced coffee. Â Dining companion ""I actually wanted hot coffee."" Waiter: Shrug. Â ""We don't HAVE coffee."" Â Dining companion: ""You're kidding!"" Waiter: ""Kidding! Hmph. Espresso only!"") Â  But the reasonably priced and very tasty food -- and the reasonably priced wine list -- here is what draws the crowds (do yourself a favor- make a reservation!). Â The perfectly juicy pan roasted chicken ($19) is served with wild mushrooms, and a heavenly potato puree. Â And though I never order pasta at French restaurants, I was craving some serious carbs, so I had the pappardelle with cherry tomatoes, basil, and asiago - this tasted like summer, pure and simple, but with a serious kick of crushed red pepper. It's nice to know that if you have a friend coming in from Grand Central, the only option isn't Chipotle.",1
1688,4,1,9/25/2013,"The 14.95 fixe priced brunch brought me and my friends in Saturday morning. The meal started off great with a round of mimosas and great conversation. I unfortunately ordered the Croque Monsieur and was excited for it. But when I got my food, it was cold, the cheese was congealed and tasted like rubber. The ham tasted like package deli meat... The kind with the slime and the ""brioche"" was the ends of a bread loaf. I felt like puking after two bites. It was literally inedible and super dissappointing. Ugh never again!",1
1689,4,4,9/22/2013,"Went for dinner at 7:30 on a Saturday night, with a reservation. Tips: I would definitely go with a reservation--seating is very limited, and the space is small, so without a reservation on a Friday or Saturday night, getting a seat would take a while. Food: Ordered the steak tartare--friends ordered the french onion soup, endive salad, steak frites. The steak tartare was very yummy (although I've never had any before, so I have nothing to which I can compare it). A little too garlic-y, but nonetheless quite tasty for a patty of ground raw meat. It was served with fries, but it was annoying that the fries they gave me were clearly the end bits (barely 1 inch long fries) while my friends got the long, normal fries.... Steak frites were also very good, if a little too salty. Wine selection is fair as well, with good prices ($29 for a bottle of sauvignon blanc, $8 for the glass). We also tried the creme brulee and it was a great choice--I don't usually like creme brulee, but it wasn't too sweet, and the textures were indicative of a well-made brulee. Service: The two French owners (I presumed) are friendly and prompt with their service and communication. Very accommodating. However, the server who gave us our food was too brusque, a little unfriendly, and didn't have very good service manners (i.e. just grabbing things from in front of us in a brusque manner/shoving things aside kind of carelessly). Will definitely come back again, and it's definitely a good place for a date.",1
1690,4,4,9/20/2013,"Tasty, freshly prepared French dishes at a good price. Â Place is a little on the smaller side, but not bad.",1
1691,4,4,9/19/2013,"I'm really fond of this place. Â It does have a more Parisian feel than a lot of other bistros in the city. Â It's small and gets pretty loud--a better place for friends than an intimate date. Â Steak frites are solid, wine was good, and I left very happy. Â I'll definitely be back.",1
1692,4,5,9/18/2013,Great find in Murray Hill. The food was Â delicious and very reasonably priced for the area. Service was warm and attentive. Very convivial despite the small room.,1
1693,4,4,9/13/2013,"French onion soup, one of the best I've had. Not too salty yet flavorful. The evenly baked cheese on top does not overwhelm the onion soup at all. The beef tartar was very refreshing, didn't think I would finish it but I devoured it in less than 5 minutes. Loved it. Got the mussels as well, they were really fresh and meaty not dry. However the tomato base I choose for it was really light, wish I went with the garlic one instead Waiters were nice, kept asking if we needed anything and made sure our water is always filled. I would definitely go back to try other dishes :)",1
1694,4,5,9/10/2013,"Excellent all around -- great food, truly outstanding service, and amazingly reasonable prices. Â We're going back ...",1
1695,4,5,9/9/2013,"Took a girl here for brunch, place was absolutely delicious. The eggs Benedict gave my mouth the best food orgasm it ever had. Real talk stop reading this and go eat here.",1
1696,4,5,9/9/2013,Gem... nothing fancy just fantastic food. Â Wish the beer/wine options were a little more extensive. Â All in all just a true French Bistro experience!,1
1697,4,4,9/1/2013,Went there for the brunch on a week-end. This is definitely a French place as everybody is French out there. Nice decor although not fancy. Food and service were good. Will go back.,1
1698,4,4,8/31/2013,Great brunch. Loved the atmosphere and our eggs florentine were cooked perfectly. Service was fast and my water glass was never left empty. The place is on the smaller side so plan accordingly if you have a big party!,1
1699,4,4,8/25/2013,The French toast is very fluffy! Apple compote and banana are fresh! Good meal!,1
1700,4,4,8/23/2013,pleasant surprise,1
1701,4,4,8/21/2013,"I came here with my friend for a belated birthday celebration (for me). Â This is another hole in the wall spot but adorable nonetheless. Â Not too fancy, not too dark, but it's just right. Â The staff was extremely courteous and helpful; Â We were assisted with wine selection, meal of the day, as well as dessert. Â Our waiter saw that she gave me a birthday card and served my dessert with a candle! I thought that was super cool and thoughtful. Best for couples, dates, or besties to relax, chill, and eat pretty authentic french food. Would I go back, most definitely.",1
1702,4,4,8/19/2013,"Small and quiet. Great service, and a small but unique menu with both French classics and unique dishes. Great wine selection with a wait staff that is more than willing to help you choose the perfect bottle. Nice portion size.",1
1703,4,4,8/12/2013,"Stopped in here randomly for brunch and really enjoyed it. My boyfriend loved his eggs benedict, I was crazy about the frittata. Free sangria didn't hurt!",1
1704,4,4,8/10/2013,"A friend from Cali and I had brunch here this afternoon. She had a spinach omlette and specified she only wanted egg whites. Â I had a Croque Monsiuer, which came with a salad. Â The food was delivered fast, correct and delicious. Â The service was prompt and our waters were refilled promptly. Â For brunch, $13.95 gets you a tasty, satisfying entrÃ©e and a mimosa, san gria, coffee or OJ. Â I opted for the fruity wine and I was very pleased. Â I will definitely be back.",1

1706,4,4,8/7/2013,"Good, unpretentious food. I had dinner there, late one Saturday, with my wife. The food was excellent, the wine was good. My wife had the special that night, striped bass, with ratatouille and olive tapenade. She loved it. I had a steak frites, and we shared a creme brulee. Service was quick and attentive, ambiance was not too noisy. We enjoyed ourselves. We will definitely return.",1
1707,4,4,8/5/2013,"Tiny place which plays into its 'boutique' feel which wasn't bad. Â Nothing on the menu honestly looked authentic French aside from the traditional escargo but the service was a bid spacey with no urgency of accelerating the dining experience; so appropriate if you're looking for the 'authentic' french experience. Â I will say however the Filet Mignon Carpaccio was quite elegant and tasty. Â The Duck confit was equally presented and delightful. Â I also recommend the dessert menus in which you can't seem to go wrong. Â All in all, pretty good experience with cheap wine and affordable cuisine. Â So more like 3 1/2 stars.",1
1708,4,4,8/4/2013,"Delicious, authentic and very cute. Ate brunch there and definitely want to go back for dinner.",1
1709,4,4,8/2/2013,"Great french dinner! From the outside, I was expecting it to be a little fancier than it was inside. Â Decor was not as charming as I expected, but then the food and service began and all worries of pretentiousness were thrown out the window. Just finished up a delicious dinner there with the gf. Â They squeezed us in (squoze us in?) for a friday dinner at 7pm. Â Staff very courteous to us and all patrons - even as they had to turn away most walk-ins. Â My spinach and goat cheese salad was really delicious, with just the right amount of dressing. Â Her french onion soup was great, with just the right amount of salty and sweet - though it needed a little fresh pepper. My skate was excellent, her half chicken was good. Â She replaced the mashed potatos with the frites - excellent choice. Â The dessert - get the creme brulee - as others have said, it was outstanding. A bit pricey when the final bill came, but was a great meal overall. Â Will definitely return, and would like to try brunch some time.",1
1710,4,4,8/2/2013,"Made an early - 6:30 is early by NY standards - reservation here for myself and my parents. It was the perfect atmosphere for us to catch up and eat well. The hostess/waitress/owner? Seated us immediately and was lovely despite Â the demands of running the entire front of house. My parents go to France often, the atmosphere and in my father's words this place 'truly transports you to France and the only difference is there is a working air con'. Â To start we had Â escargot, country pÃ¢tÃ©, and tomato soup/goat cheese special. For mains the chicken, mussels, and calves liver. I would say the chicken was the star, crispy skin and full flavored. Escargot was delicious and calves liver was cooked perfect, deliciously slightly pink on the inside. The mussels fell a little short, this did not stop me from devouring any my mother didn't find in the creamy white wine broth. Profiteroles and Island capped the night with a ruby port. I love a place that serves ruby though this one was really mild. Will dream of the profiteroles and pass on the Island next time.",1
1711,4,4,7/31/2013,"This is a great find in the Murray Hill neighborhood. The place is small but cozy. I ordered the saffron and mustard cream mussels and was very satisfied by the taste. Lots of food for a great price. Service was adequate. Overall, no major complaints.",1

1713,4,5,7/22/2013,This is the real deal. Â If you are looking for true French food Le Parisien is the place to go. Â  My wife had the duck confit and said it tasted just like it is prepared in France. Â She is a French teacher and travels to France often. Â  I had the bistro steak and it was great. Â It was more like chateaubriand then anything else!,1
1714,4,4,7/22/2013,"I found Le Parisien as I was searching online for affordable brunch in NYC. I'm a visual learner, so the pics of the food looked amazing. We decided to give it a go. When we arrived we were greeted immediately and seated. I had the salmon benedict and it was really really good. The eggs were poached perfectly. I will definitely go back and try their dinner menu.",1
1715,4,3,7/21/2013,"We would rate Le Parisien a 3.5 if we could. Our party of four liked the casual setting and friendly staff. The steak frites was fantastic, poached salmon was good. Spinach salad was very good, but could have done with more goat cheese on it. Mussels did the job, frites were best. One person loved the roast squash soup with apple, though I thought it was too sweet. Would go again for an easy neighborhood dinner.",1

We shared the Marseilles mussels, steak tartar, and duck confit, along with a great bottle of white wine. The restaurant is a little in the small side (~10-15 tables) so be sure to make a reservation ahead of time!",1
1718,4,4,7/16/2013,I really enjoyed this place. The atmosphere was quaint and they had a nice selection of wine and food to choose from. I had the salmon which was amazing and some pomme frittes. We also enjoyed the wine list and the staff was very helpful in making selections. Â This was a good experience all around. Thanks for reading and enjoy.,1
1719,4,4,7/13/2013,"This is a great brunch restaurant. Their weekend menu has a prix fix deal that includes a mimosa, a coffee, or Bellini with your meal. I ordered the croque monsieur. It was very tasty and I enjoyed it a lot. It also came with a salad on the side. The bread was awesome, the service was great, and the mimosa was pretty legit. It can get a little crowded during lunch so go around 12:30 or earlier if you want to be seated quickly. Also, the place can get a little loud. Small place. Lots of people trying to have a conversation. So if one table starts getting loud, everyone just ends up screaming at their friends while they talk. Therefore, if you eat here. Keep your voice down for the rest of us. Don't scream at your friends. Love them, softly... Thank you!",1

1721,4,3,7/10/2013,"This place can be easily missed because it's a very unassuming, and also off of a main avenue. The inside is small so make reservations when you can. I needed a last minute place for dinner and they luckily had space. I had the duck confit - it was very well made, not overly oily, as I've had in some places, and well-seasoned. I didn't have a dessert but my friends had profiteroles, which they loved. The service was great and the staff didn't rush you out like many other restaurants in the city.",1
1722,4,4,7/7/2013,"I haven't been to France in almost 8 years (a little piece of me just died just having said that), but Le Parisien came pretty close to bringing me back without the use of teleporting. Don't know why but I was expecting more of a romantic high end atmosphere... and I'm glad that it wasn't. The mood was casual yet intimate and had a certain je ne sais quoi with its vintage posters, cafÃ© furniture and candles. It reminded me of all those little bistros I would pop into for a meal while running around gay Paris (pronounced ""PAH-ree"" of course). The owners are French so when it comes to generating that French bistro feel, they know what they're doing. One look at the menu and I was hooked. Steak? Duck? Mussels? Tartare? Check, check and double check. Heck, they even have escargot. I don't eat snails though; I had too many of them as pets as a child. Still, they got 'em. Appetizers -Duck Prosciutto with Melon and Fennel Salad: To start, I had this special. Although the duck was tasty and the melon ripe and juicy, I just wish there had been more of le quack. Oh well. -French Onion Soup: My friend ordered this for his appetizer. I was able to steal a hearty spoonful of the broth/cheese/bread combo and thought it was superb. Just how I remembered it. Entrees -Duck Confit with Crispy Potatoes, Mushrooms and FrisÃ©e Salad: The potatoes weren't particularly crispy but the duck skin sure was! Crispy on the outside and juice dark meat on the inside on top of a fresh bed of frisÃ©e and thinly sliced mushrooms. My only qualm was that portion was on the small side as well. I guess they guard their duck very closely here. -Steak Tartare with Salad and French Fries: Definitely my favorite of the night and the LARGEST of all the entrees. They present you with a giant slab of perfectly seasoned raw beef with a raw egg yolk on top in it's shell alongside a bed of fresh greens. Oh and they give you a hearty serving of delicious, crispy fries. If you love steak tartare this entree is your best bet! It satisfies all of your cravings. Ok my cravings. After all of this food, I had to forgo the dessert menu even though the items looked delicious. Other diners around me kept ordering the crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e which I kept hearing was fantastic. Service throughout by our lovely French waiters was attentive but not overly so. I also loved the selection of wines by the glass which were posted on the giant chalk board near the front. Love that they have wines from Cote du Rhone. La Parisien has definitely become my go to French restaurant that won't cost me my first born. They have a $13.95 brunch special that I really want to check out but let's be honest, unless they decide to serve steak tartar at that time, I'm coming back for dinner first.",1
1723,4,4,6/26/2013,"This is my new favorite. Its a cheap competitor to Balthazar with a limited menu. Food quality is as good and flavors are authentic french brassiere. Calves livers, steak, moules, pomme frit were all great. Escargot were overcooked and i suspect they are canned, but that's ok i'm not paying 20 bucks. Three ppl with a bottle of wine $150. Service is typical take it or leave it French",1
1724,4,3,6/25/2013,"I am not a huge fan of American brunch...and this place does not meet the standards of the best brunch places I have been to in NYC...So, in terms of food, this place is average. However, I would like to say it is a very quaint place, the setting is a bit traditional. The manager (maybe?) appears to be French. The service is definitely nice, they are very attentive -- I did not try any sangria myself, but my dining buddy definitely enjoyed it. For $13.95 including brunch + sangria/mimosa/coffee, it's not a bad deal in NYC.",1
1725,4,5,6/24/2013,Really great gem of a place. Â I felt like I was back in Paris while I was eating there. Â I'd definitely go back again!,1
1726,4,5,6/19/2013,"Overall, it's an excellent, casual, French, neighborhood bistro. The food is tasty and recipes are authentic. The service, from my numerous experiences there, has always been consistent and solid. The owner and the staff are very friendly, but not too intrusive. The decor I find very cozy and alludes to a old Parisian atmosphere. I would recommend this place any time of the week. However, beware they can be very busy for brunch or dinner on weekend so you might want to plan ahead! Among my go-to dishes are the steak-frites, endive salad, and the goat cheese salad. Although I don't eat them, I heard the mussels were great!",1
1727,4,3,6/18/2013,"After suffering a withdrawal from the brasserie-life of Paris, my wife and I were delighted to discover this little spot. Service was prompt, decor was nice (a little over the top) and most importantly, the food was exactly what I was looking for. Escargot - 6 on a classic serving tray. Quite large. Very tasty & Mussles (moules mariniÃ¨res) is the quintessential French holiday dish. Prices seem reasonable, though I really dislike this neighborhood. Had the location been in LES (or downtown in general), I'd bump it up to 4 stars.",1
1728,4,4,6/17/2013,"Very neat and authentic little french place owned by a french couple. It made me feel as if I am in Paris. Would recommend the escargot, the mussels, daily fishes, and also the duck...none of them are the best in the city, but all are above average at very resonable prices. Also has a very friendly wine list that offers 10-15 different selections, not great, but pairs fine with its family setting and atmosphere. Their desserts were great too, I have had the apple tart and the cream brulee thus far and would return and order them again and again!",1
1729,4,1,6/17/2013,Can i have a little skate with my ammonia? Skate was so ammoniated the fumes shot through my nose and singed my brain. Saw someone else send back escargots. Whhyyyy is this place so popular? +1 star for prompt service and the authentic ambience. But ammoniated skate is unforgivable.,1
1730,4,4,6/8/2013,"We Â read some good reviews and made a reservation for a half hour later. Our table was ready upon arrival. This is a charming little restaurant in the Murray Hill neighborhood. We ordered a variety of foods, pea and mint soup was very fresh, warm lentil salad was delicious with a mild flavorful dressing and very fresh watercress. I had a grilled baby artichoke arugula salad with a few roasted to tomatoes. The vinegarette was so sublime,just perfectly balanced. All the greens were very fresh. The steak and frittes were good and one of the specials was great: duck breast with roasted white peaches. We were very pleased with everything .",1
1731,4,5,6/4/2013,Came here for dinner last week. The atmosphere was cozy and charming. And the food was FANTASTIC. I ordered the pappardelle pasta and my friend ordered the pork. Both were excellent. Will definitely be returning.,1
1732,4,3,5/29/2013,Wanted to like it. Â The steak frites were not terribly good. It was cooked right but onion glaze was a tad strange and meat a was a little sinewy. Â The fries were over cooked just a bit. Service was unattentive. No baguettes not any cheese to be found. Parisien? I'm afraid not...,1
1733,4,5,5/28/2013,"Went there with a couple of girlfriends for brunch and then again with a friend for dinner. Â They don't take reservations for brunch but there was no wait since we arrived shortly after they opened. Everything was delicious. For brunch: Â We had the poached eggs with salmon, ham and gruyÃ¨re sandwich, and eggs florentine with spinach. Each dish comes with a drink (we had mimosas and sangria) for $13.95. For dinner: Â We shared the filet mignon carpaccio to start. Â Then we ordered the Marinieres mussels - the serving size was decent and the broth was delicious, and the duck confit which was excellently done with a nice crispy skin. Â For dessert we shared the upside down apple pie with ice cream which.. didn't amaze me. Note: Â The tables are extremely close together so if it's crowded don't expect to have a private conversation.",1
1734,4,4,5/27/2013,"My overall experience here was very Â enjoyable. With a reservation at 7pm on a Friday night, I was happily seated 10 mins earlier while waiting for my friends to arrive. The wine here is really inexpensive. A not-so-fancy bottle of wine starts at $35, which is almost unheard of in the area. I would highly recommend the mussels. Great portion to share and is accompanied by a side of fries. All entrees we had were pleasant. The steak frites and duck confit were very well executed. The desserts were not as impressive.",1
1735,4,4,5/24/2013,"Have actually gone twice. Â The first time for dinner and then for brunch. Â Both times a great experience. Â Wife had the liver, that was very good, I had the steak and frits, which despite being marinated which I normally dont like, was very good. Â Service was excellent. Â Best point, you can order a 1/2 litre of wine, like in Europe or Canada. The Brunch was also very good!",1
1736,4,4,5/23/2013,"being from Canada and noticing how inexpensive the wine was it was a no brainer ordering up a nice Grand Cru bottle at $49. I really enjoyed the food here: buttery escargot, tender juicy steak and the roasted artichoke shrimp. every dish was very flavorful and prepared flawlessly. the service was equally exceptional. Overall great value resto in nyc be sure to book reservations as seating is limited in this paris style dÃ©cor resto.",1
1737,4,4,5/22/2013,Delicious brunch. I've been here four times for brunch. It is consistently great. Highlights include the goat cheese frittata and the French toast. Minus one star for the price increase and the cramped quarters.,1
1738,4,4,5/22/2013,"Lovely place, perfect for a casual, well-prepared meal. Â Small, intimate, maybe a little noisy but for just two people not a problem. Â Excellent service, very friendly and accommodating, we felt right at home. Â Appetizers (beef carpaccio and duck pate) were terrific, first rate; mussels and steak frites main courses were good to very good, especially the frites, fabulous. Â Apple tarte tatin with vanilla ice cream a satisfying dessert, the espresso was full and rich, no bitterness. Â Wine list modest, but well priced and no problem finding something very potable for our meal. Â The price was very fair. Â If we lived in NYC, it would be the perfect place to go, especially impromptu during the week, for a casual, relaxed dinner. Â We are out of towners, but will definitely go again on our next New York trip. Â Richard K. Scher",1

1741,4,5,5/15/2013,"Paris in NYC! Really reminded me of a Parisian restaurant - cozy space, open windows, cute decor, I can go on. We were seated immediately despite not having reservations. I had the steak & fries and my company ordered the salmon. Both dishes were EXCELLENT and the portions were just right.",1
1742,4,3,5/13/2013,"Cute little cafe with a great $13.95 brunch option that comes with one drink. Â This price is on the menu, so not sure why this is also their yelp check-in offer--no need for that! Food came out pretty quickly... the eggs benedict is better than the garden omelet which was bland. Â Fries are good and salad is fresh.",1
1743,4,5,5/13/2013,Le Parisien is a small and cozy French bistro. Â Reminds me of France! I ordered the Pouched Eggs with Salmon Gravlax on English Muffins with Hollandaise Sauce with a glass of Sangria for $15. Â The Grilled Steak Sandwich on Ciabatta and the Mussels with Garlic and White Wine Sauce were yummy. Â Great brunch spot and I will definitely be coming back.,1
1744,4,4,5/5/2013,"We had a very good meal at Le Perisien. There were three of us and all of our food was good. My husband said his tomato soup was some of the best he's ever had. The atmosphere is simple, but nice. The service was excellent. Fair prices, especially for the city. Would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a reliably good meal at a reasonable price.",1
1745,4,4,4/23/2013,"Cute little spot for brunch, felt tiny with lots French flair (...literally there's a ton of French iconography adorning the walls). Reasonable brunch deal for $14 that comes with one drink, coffee or cocktail or juice. I had to order a croque monsieur which was outstanding but sadly didn't come with fries (fries are only served with the egg meals). Â I paid extra to get coffee and fries; the fries were a little disappointing. The service was good and the croque monsieur will ensure my return.",1
1746,4,3,4/16/2013,"Having had dined here twice before, I realized the place is either a hit or miss - the food was completely different the first and second time around. First, the atmosphere is definitely very genuine and akin to a bistro in Paris. Slow service where you really gotta sip on some wine and chat. For the first visit I had the Espagnole, chorizo mussels which were delicious..i literally wanted to slurp the soup! My friend had the French onion soup and pork tenderloin which I was able to taste and enjoyed both very much. Overall, that was a hit experience. However the second time my party and I shared the Thai mussels as an appetizer portion. Though it was still flavorful, the Espagnole was definitely better. I decided to go a bit more adventurous and had their special for the night - monkfish with a potato purÃ©e, scallions, mushrooms. That was a mistake! It could've been 5 bites and for $25?! My friend's steak frites, the most highlighted menu item, was really good. Juicy, savory, appetizing but then again how can you go wrong with steak frites! If I had to come back again this is the only thing I feel really worth getting. After trying La Sirene, I couldn't help being biased since they have many more creative items. I would recommend La Sirene more for the food.",1
1747,4,5,4/16/2013,"Excellent, real bistro-style French restaurant, with steak-frites as good as what you could get in Paris. Fantastic desserts (especially the profiteroles). Good atmosphere, good wine choice and great service. Wish I lived a LOT closer to this place. If I'm in New York again, I'll definitely be back.",1
1748,4,4,4/16/2013,"Came here with a couple of friends for some delicious french food. Â  Great selection of wine. Mussels --awesome flavor, huge bowl (great for sharing) Steak fritz --the winner of the table!!! yum yum yum, perfectly cooked, huge slab of fries. Envy of the table. Fresh fish -some time of cod, good flavor, medium portion *Make reservations* or you will be waiting a bit, very small inside (~15 tables)",1
1749,4,4,4/11/2013,"This is a cute little restaurant we found. Very small but the food was fantastic. I had the special for the day which was the skate fish, which was flavored nicely with the mushroom. Mussels marineres were good with the white wine and garlic broth even though it was a bit over cooked, the mussels came to be quite small. Overall I would recommend this place we've tried a couple other appetizers that was delicious as well. Service was good. Price was very reasonable for a French restaurant.",1
1750,4,3,4/8/2013,"Nothing special, it might be because I have eaten in Paris or maybe because it was bland and flavorless but I am totally not impressed nor would I need to go back. The atmosphere is nice... you do feel like you in Paris but the food doesn't match the atmosphere. We had escargot, potato and garlic soup, the mussels and the duck confit and none of those dishes were impressive. They weren't bad but they weren't good either. just ok.",1
1751,4,4,4/7/2013,"I went here for my small birthday brunch with a group of 5 women. Previously, on the phone, I was told the space is small and not conducive for big groups but was advised that I should arrive later for a better chance of getting a table (since they don't take reservations). I arrived at 1PM and as soon as my full party arrived they accommodated 5 of us in a very packed bistro! Fantastic and reliable dishes across the board including highlights like a croque monsieur with ham and poached eggs with lox & hollandaise sauce including a large variety of healthier options. I even dropped my phone behind the tall couches and the waitress was kind enough to try her luck and inch her way in and get it out of the crevice. Wonderful service and lovely people. I would give 5 stars if it weren't for the dirty and cramped bathroom and lack of attention to our water glasses.",1
1752,4,5,4/4/2013,"The food here is great, been eating here every time I come to NYC. This is an example of what makes a good restaurant - excellent food, reasonable pricing (have not raised prices in 3 years). The decor is simple, yet unusual, makes you feel like you are dining in a small bistro in Paris :-)",1
1753,4,5,4/1/2013,"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place for lunch while we were visiting the city and it was so good we came back for the Sunday brunch! Â For lunch we split an onion soup and then the portobello sandwich for me and a chicken sandwich for him. Â Both were amazing- all of the ingredients were fresh, flavorful, and well presented on the sandwich (I hate when you get served a sandwich that is humanely impossible to eat as a sandwich). Â My boyfriend said it might be his favorite sandwich he's ever eaten. We came back for the Sunday brunch and it was just as amazing as we expected it to be! Â I loved that my salmon gravlox came with both greens and fries. Â The restaurant itself is small but charmingly decorated with French posters and a very comfortable environment. Â Staff is great. Â We were so happy to have found this place and will definitely return when we are back!",1
1754,4,4,4/1/2013,"This is such a nice little find, in the heart of midtown east. Â I would never have though to go out to this area for food, but we happened to be in the area. Â I poked my eyes through the window and saw that it was full, and there was one table left. Â Surely it was a sign - and at $13.95 for brunch with a drink, you can't beat the price. Two of us had the Eggs with Salmon Gravlax and one a mushroom omelette with asiago cheese. Â The Eggs with Salmon was beautiful when it arrived. Â The eggs were slightly running but cooked enough so it's not like I'm eating a raw egg. Â The frites were thin and crispy. Â It came with Ketchup already in a little steel cup. Â It annoys me, when they know you will ask for ketchup and they still don't take any preventative measures to place it on your plate or keep a bottle on the table. The Bellini and Sangria were good. Â Of course, if you order your drink on the side, you get a much larger glass, but it was enough to satisfy my thirst. A tight little space once you get inside, not much room for maneuvering around. Â A couple sat next to us towards the end of our meal and the girl was very annoyed at how small the space is. Â For those that have never been to France, many bistros in Paris are actually very small and you will be very comfortable with your neighbors practically at your elbows.",1
1755,4,4,3/29/2013,"Good bistro fare in a cozy, friendly atmosphere on the left bank of Murray Hill. Bon appetit!",1
1756,4,4,3/29/2013,"Came here about a week ago for an early-ish (6:30) dinner on a Thursday. The space is small and cozy, but the place wasn't crowded enough for my date and I to not feel squished. And there were candles on the table. Lovely. They had a great wine selection, and the service was quick (without being over-bearing) and friendly. The bread and butter they brought us while we waited for the food was nice - super crunchy and ""French"" like. We shared the addictive escargot (my first time trying them - seriously, don't be afraid: just go for it). They were served in a heavenly pesto-like sauce that we soaked up with bread after the escargot were gone. For entrees, I got a white fish, which was good, but his dish rocked the whole meal: bacon wrapped pork tenderloin. I was able to try a bite, and had serious food envy. The crispy bacon contrasted the melt-in-your-mouth tenderloin perfectly. I wanted to trade entrees, it was so good. We split the creme brulee for dessert. It tasted like marshmallows, which I enjoyed. An overall great experience.",1
1757,4,5,3/26/2013,"This is the best french place I've ever been to; impressed by their food. Â Most of the French restaurants are very salty but this place is just right.

1758,4,4,3/25/2013,"We stopped by Le Parisien for Sunday dinner and had an amazing experience. My brother, who was dining with me, said he had never felt more ""transported"" in a restaurant. It did feel like Paris. The food was exceptional. We got the country pate to start which was rich and subtle and delicious. Then I had the skate wing with orange sauce and my brother had the steak tartare with fries. My fish was well cooked and refreshing. His beef was a tremendous portion of really good tartare and the fries were amazing. It was a great deal--the whole meal was about 45 dollars before tip. Definitely check this place out!",1
1759,4,4,3/25/2013,"A neighborhood French spot that takes you out of the neighborhood. My little sister took me here for my birthday dinner. We had reservations for the tiny (maybe 15 table) spot, but I got the impression that the people sitting at the other tables were regulars. The space itself has been made to look like a small Left Bank bistro complete with fading French posters and newspapers about World Cup victories and stuff. The service isn't too stiff and it isn't too loose. Our waitress had no idea what the specials were and she wasn't afraid to say so, but we never felt neglected or forgotten while we ate. The salmon entre was quite good and the pino grigio we had with it was also enjoyable. We would have stayed for more wine but we had other places to be. Most of the other patrons who were there before us were still there after we left and I wouldn't be surprised if they stayed there for hours. In a part of town where the dinner experience can be less than relaxing, Le Parisien is a welcomed change of pace.",1
1760,4,5,3/20/2013,"Good quality and cheap unique price. Authentic French. I got awesome eggs, chips and mimosa.",1
1761,4,4,3/16/2013,"Had a lovely lunch here. It has an authentic French menu and my favorites were the escargot and dessert - ÃŽles flottantes. The latter is very hard to find and if you ever see it, order it! It's a vanilla crÃ¨me anglaise with meringue 'island' atop. Perfection! The only downside is the place is quite small and cramped... but it's not uncomfortable and the service was very good.",1
1762,4,4,3/15/2013,"Purpose of visit: Thursday night dinner with another couple. Our friends suggested we go to this local neighborhood restaurant. It is a cozy place with about 15 tables. Definitely a nice intimate warm casual atmosphere. We ordere a nice bottle of cabernet which was pleasantly priced. Appetizers came out quickly, my classic french onion soup was nice and hot and not too cheesy or overwhelmed with onions. We ordered the mussells with chorizo in red sauce. Excellent hoice. Mussells were nicely steamed and the sauce adde a bit o kick to the dish. Main course was pork mendallions wrapped with bacon. Normally anything wrapped with bacon is a thumbs up for me but unfortunately the pork was a little dry for me. The wife's steak dish was a much better choice. For dessert we had the merengue floating in custard pudding. Excellent. The service was attentive and unobstrusive. The atmopshere had a nice busy vibe but not overly crowded. Perfect place for a relaxing dinner at a reasonable price.",1
1763,4,5,3/14/2013,"Unbelievable value for the dollar. Â Both for the food and the wine list. Â If you are seeking great Steak Frittes for a super price, this is your place. Â  A terrific neighborhood find!",1
1317,4,4,3/14/2013,"Came here for brunch Saturday noon and were pleased to find no line unlike Penelope's. We ordered the frittata and French toast, both were great! Frittata was fluffy and filling and came with fries. The place is quite cramped and the brown curtain hanging on the inside of the front door (to keep cold air out) was a little bit weird. But since the food was good and we didn't have to wait to be seated at noon, I am quite happy.",1
1764,4,4,3/12/2013,"Tasty and great neighborhood French bistro. Been twice and would go back again. I recommend the duck confit, steak and tarte tatin.",1
1765,4,4,3/8/2013,Took an early dinner there. Â Very accomodating when I asked to re-charge my laptop. Â Soup of the day was parsnip and leek which is very authentic French country fare. Â Entree was skate served on a tasty mound of spinach and broccoli. Â Accompanied by a pleasant Sancerre from the by-the-glass menu. Â Nice experience!,1
1766,4,3,3/4/2013,"This place is adorable!!! And an amazing deal for brunch! We had a couple things go wrong, but all in all, a nice time. For only $14 bucks, you get a mimosa/sangria or coffee + entree. With everything included, it's still less than $20, which is amazing. Place is SO CUTE. It's French and all the people who work there are French and all the decorations on the walls are French. Love it. It's pretty small and can seem kind of romantic, but I'd say it's the perfect vibe for brunch. I got the Eggs Florentine and my friend got the Poached Eggs with smoked salmon. Both were very good! Comes with a small salad and french fries and the eggs on English muffins. Definitely enough food! I wouldn't say it's the best poached eggs or brunch meal, but def good enough. Mimosa was also pretty tasty (though small). My friend ordered a cup of coffee and when the guy delivered it he ended up spilling the coffee everywhere, which was kind of a mess. But it ended up being on the house (we didn't even ask) so that was really nice. Coffee also has free refills. Also, halfway through the meal, I realized my water glass had a gross bumpy dirt residue on the outside. I was kind of disgusted. So it wasn't completely perfect! But I'd come back again and definitely give this place another chance. Plus, the staff were so so nice!",1
1767,4,3,2/27/2013,"Let me first say that I'm not a fan of French cuisine. Â I'm a bit clueless as to what to order, which explains why I ordered the pasta instead of something more frenchy. The restaurant ambiance is very cozy with a tables along both walls in an open layout. Â Not a bad place for a date night, although I did come here earlier in the evening so the place wasn't packed at that time. Â Service was very cordial and friendly. Â The gentleman who greeted me offered me any open table. So as mentioned, I ordered the pappardelle pasta. Â Probably not the best choice at a French restaurant. Â It was a bit average - the pasta itself was good, but the sauce was a bit bland. Â Portion size was reasonable, but being more of a meat and potatoes person, I was missing the meat. Â My dining partner ordered the duck con fit and said it was very good. Â I don't eat duck so I can't really comment as to how good it was. Overall, it was a good place for a good meal. Â I'm not a fan of French cuisine so I can't say I'll return. Â If I was a fan, this may be my regular place because of the kindness of the staff, the non-pretentiousness of the restaurant, and the reasonable prices of the menu items. Â If you're a fan, give this place a try.",1

1769,4,5,2/24/2013,"I thought this place was just fabulous! Lovely place but not super posh or pretentious. Very authentically French. This was one of very few places that every single plate I tried was outstanding. My boyfriend and I each got an app, main course and dessert. All parts were so so tasty and enjoyable ( I sampled every plate). We also each got one drink and the bill came out to about $100 including tip. Overall, for the quality of the food, the atmosphere/service, and price, this place is a steal. Can't wait to come back. Simply charming. You wont be disappointed with this great place!",1
1770,4,4,2/21/2013,"After poring over the brunch menu, I decided on the eggs florentine with a mimosa (of course!) and both were quite tasty. Yum yum spinach! This was my first time having Â eggs florentine and I am definitely going to get it again. Also, the fries are addicting so if you know you won't be able to finish, bring someone who you know will help you eat them! Also, I'm not sure if it was a glitch in the system, but last time I came, my credit card got charged for $30 instead of the $16 that was on my receipt. I brought up the issue with Chase who refunded me the difference so it wasn't a big deal. However, it might be good to just keep that in mind.",1

1775,4,5,2/10/2013,"This place is as good as it gets. It's a hidden gem in Murray Hill of all places. Â I'm almost afraid to write about it, as it's been my secret go-to place. Â  It's honest real French bistro food prepared by a French chef, served by French ex-pats. Â It ain't fancy, and it ain't trying to be trendy. It's perfect. Â It's small and it's crowded. The food is always skillfully and deliciously prepared. Â Everything seasoned just right. No matter what I have ordered, it's been great. Start with their roasted artichoke salad. Â OMG!!! It's a must. Â Entrees offer their known-for mussel preparations served with a side of crispy frites. Â  The real-deal duck confit is served with crispy potatoes and wild mushrooms over a frisee salad.. Â You'll feel as if you're sitting in a bistro in the Marais. Â The roast chicken with pomme puree, or the sautÃ©ed cafe's liver topped with caramelized onions are perfect for a cold winter's night. Â Oh my. Â The pan-roasted skate is to die for. Â Or try one of the best steak frites in the city. Â It's served with their take on a red wine thyme sauce with glazed shallots. Â And of course those can't-stop-eating frites. Â The specials are always fantastic. Â Last week I had the coq au vin. Â It was melt-in-your-mouth wonderful. Â Seriously I've never been disappointed. Desserts are traditional too. Â Try the profiteroles or the tarte tartan. Â Yum. Order a bottle of the Cote de Rhone to go with. Â Be happy.",1
1776,4,4,2/9/2013,"This place is very small and the decor seems depressing for a place that otherwise seems so French. The man waiting on us and seating us was great, he was very helpful. A lot of the patrons that came in were speaking French. Let's start with the bad. The coffee. Very bad. It was bitter and watered down. I accidentally put way too much creamer in it, but even the excess couldn't give it any flavor. Now the good. The food was decent. Everyone seemed to require salt or pepper or some other spice or condiment to get the food to a truly taste place, but all the ingredients were there.",1
1777,4,4,2/6/2013,Wonderful meal at a good price point for NYC! We loved the Grilled Artichoke salad and the Thai Pei Mussels. Â Atmosphere reminds me of small cafes in Paris.... :D,1
1778,4,2,2/2/2013,"Average for brunch. Prix fixe is reasonable for NYC standards BUT there is nothing remarkable about the food. Decor and wait staff aside, it's not French by any stretch of the imagination. My food was bland and shapeless--and who serves French fries at brunch? Hash browns would be better. Not to mention my ""wild mushroom"" omelette was placed on top of the side salad, wilting all the lettuce and destroying its flavor. (Come to think of it, neither the mushrooms nor supposed cheese could be tasted.) Your average diner will give you a tastier breakfast.",1
1779,4,5,2/2/2013,"Other reviews are correct this is indeed a little gem! Made a reservation but still waited 20 minutes or so. It was ok as you see that people come to converse over fantastic french faire. Very much Â bistro style, simple solid menu and a attentive staff. Wine list is a bit lacking but I liked the '09 Gigondas(good vintage and great subregion) with my calf liver and it paired well with the duck special. Prices are very reasonable, dinner for two with a bottle was $91.... Definitely worth trying for yourself... Just don't go the same night as me!",1
1780,4,3,2/2/2013,"This place is pretty OK for brunch with groups of less than 4. The wait is usually short, especially compared with Penelope's (this was 20 minutes for us). However, the food is pretty average in my experience. I've had the grilled chicken sandwich and croque monsieur before and both were pretty bland tasting. However, they do serve a pretty mean french fry.",1

1782,4,5,2/1/2013,Love this place! The restaurant was on a street not on an avenue. The target customers are not tourists but mostly ppl in the neighborhood(like me) or ppl who learn about the restaurants through word of mouth. It was snowing on the day we went to this place for dinner and the place was packed. I ordered the Steak frites and the steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare as requested. The frites were amazing. My friend ordered the pork tenderloin with this herb butter sauce. The pork was perfectly cooked and it was very juicy. Food was good for the price.,1
1783,4,5,1/28/2013,Found this place by accident on a trip into NYC on a Saturday morning. Brunch was being served and is a good price for the city and comes with a mimosa. Additional is only $5 more and in New York that is not bad. Food was really good and quick service. Would def come back.,1
1784,4,4,1/28/2013,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in the city. It is located in Murray Hill in an unassuming neighborhood that is devoid of swarming tourists and whatever else walks the streets at 10am in the morning. When you walk in, you are immersed in a culture of clinking glasses, indistinct conversations about what happened last night, and the smell of good food. Atmosphere is casual, rustic French. The brunch special is a great deal, and for the quality of the food, is basically a steal. You mean I get a mimosa too with 12.95 of scrumptious goodness? Vous etes fous! I love anything French, and so I may be possibly biased. But good French food, like anything else, is hard to find under the many shams of a Croque-Monsieur that restaurants will often attempt to throw at your plate and expect you to devour it without complaints. In this case, I did order a Croque-Monsieur, which was toasted with just the right amount of butter, ham, and gruyere cheese. I also inhaled the side of potatoes and salad greens, leaving a glossy, shiny white plate. You know how your dog will finish all the kibble in his dish in about 23 seconds and then spends the next seconds voraciously licking his empty bowl? Yep. We did not make a reservation, and waited approximately 15 minutes for a seat to open up. Â  C'est magnifique. Looking forward to trying dinner here.",1
1785,4,4,1/27/2013,"My boyfriend loves mussels so I took him here back in 2012. We had the endive salad to start and it was so delicious, we ordered a 2nd salad. We also had the escargot, which was yummy and wished there were more, but we opted to forgo another one as we still had the mussels coming. For our entrees, he had the thai mussels and I had the espagnole mussels. He enjoyed his, as I did mine, but I did think his were better than mine. The mussels came with bread, but not enough of it to soak up that yummy broth. We requested more, and it still wasn't enough. The mussels came with fries and they were delicious, though a few too many were fried too dry. The atmosphere was very lovely and the service was wonderful as well. If it weren't so far in the city, we would go back. I remember spending about $70 before tax.",1
1786,4,5,1/26/2013,"Great traditional French food, such as moules-frites combined with a nice ambiance and reasonable wine prices. Really enjoyed my meal here and the owners were really friendly as well.",1
1787,4,2,1/25/2013,"food: onion soup - bland, lacks rich caramelized onion flavor, beet salad - decent but nothing to rave about, steak sandwich & frites - best thing out of the whole meal. Â  service: okay probably won't go back",1
1788,4,3,1/24/2013,"Really delicious brunch, and right around the corner from my apartment! How did I just find this place a few weeks ago?! For $14, you get your meal, coffee or tea, and a cocktail.

Had an Onion Soup and Steak & Frites. Absolutely loved them! Also, the staff and the owner/manager were very friendly and warm, made us feel welcome. Will definitely go back when we visit NYC again!",1
1792,4,1,1/5/2013,"I've lived in the neighborhood for 9 years and my go to French bistro has always been Les Halles. Looking to try something else my husband and I decided to go to Le Parisien. One Friday night a few weeks ago my husband and I walked in to Le Parisien after our movie at Kips Bay let out. The maÃ®tre d' greeted us at the door and we said ""table for two,"" and he said, ""ok, but you have to order right away because we close in 5 minutes."" Since it's a very small restaurant most of the patrons heard this and looked at us. What he should've said was, ""I'm sorry but we are closing in 5 minutes"" or something else along those lines. We would've understood. Embarrassed, my husband and I walked out and went to Les Halles. We'll never try Le Parisien again. What a terrible way to treat customers.",1
1793,4,5,1/4/2013,"Honestly loved this place. Â I think it's great for taking fans of french cuisine to (even if they have actual experience from visiting France) or would make a perfect date night for that someone special. I have to admit that more often than not I order the SautÃ©ed Calf's Liver as my entree, but that is just because it is soooo delicious and has never disappointed me. Â It's extremely rich and requires a taste for liver, but if that sounds like your thing I promise you will be in heaven. We've sampled several of the apps and my wife always tries different entrees. Â They've all been a hit with us, and our guests. Â Roasted beet salad, French Onion Soup, and the Escargot all come to mind as recommended appetizers. Â My wife has let me sample her Bistro Steak (great frites!) and her Duck Confit and they also come easily recommended. It's not just the food. Â The service has been exemplary and the ambience feels like it's just a slice of Provence in NYC. Â And the reasonability of the prices far exceed anything I have ever seen in NYC, with appetizers averaging $9-10 and the most delicious entrees starting at $16, but never exceeding $24 which in my opinion is a steal for the best French cuisine I have tasted in Manhattan so far. To the team at Le Parisien, I tip my beret to you!",1
1794,4,4,1/3/2013,"Still loving this place. Â Cute no pretentious bistro in the middle of Murray Hill. Â They don't get super packed during the week and they let you linger but when you need fast service, they can accommodate that too. Super good French onion soup.",1
1795,4,5,12/30/2012,"Lunch with colleagues became a nearly two-hour gastronomic affair. This place takes their food French-seriously good: the roasted chicken was good-to-the-bone delicious and the starter onion soup brought back Paris memories to all. Creme brulee (whoa), profiteroles and the floating island with cappu ended our meal well.",1
1796,4,4,12/23/2012,Great value for the money! French toast was excellent and the eggs benedict were very good. Mimosa was great! Service was very good and the atmosphere was just like Paris. Would come again!,1
1797,4,3,12/18/2012,Wish I could give this place 3 1/2 stars.... Definitely one of the best options for brunch in Murray Hill. The eggs benedict is delish and you really cant beat the price of brunch. However on my last visit both myself and my friend commented on how dirty we thought the place was! The table next to us had a water glass that had white dust (or mold) all over it...pretty gross! Plus I found a bug in my water. The food was good but we both were turned off by the lack of cleanliness.,1
1798,4,4,12/18/2012,"Le Parisien is a comfy little Euro style bistro in Manhattan. Â When I came here for brunch with friends, this place was packed. Â I could soon see why. Â The food was fantastic. Â I really enjoyed the eggs benedict as it came out both fast and fresh. Â Service was solid. Â Pricing is all relative, but the quantity of food makes the pricing fair, but certainly not a steal. Â Would nonetheless recommend this place to others. Â Just have some patience when it comes to being seated for brunch.",1

1801,4,5,12/15/2012,"This place is awesome. The tight quarters, which I imagine may be disliked by some, really helps transport you to a nice Parisian bistro, which is, of course, this place's goal. I think it completely accomplishes this goal. The posters lining the walls, the dimly lit decor, and the European-accent-bearing staff all contribute to bringing me back to Paris. I started with the soup du jour - the cream of turnip soup. It was incredible. Sure, it was a bit heavy on the cream side, but I really couldn't complain because the turnip flavor wasn't masked. I thought I was taking a risk by ordering it, but it came through. I got the chicken as my entree. Some of the best chicken I've ever had. The mushrooms and gravy sauce complemented it perfectly. I highly recommend the chicken. We also split a bottle of the $31 Cotes du Rhone. It was definitely a quality wine. Maybe not the best Cotes out there, but for $31 in the city, definitely a good buy. I tried the ""floating island"" and the profiterole desserts, along with the two dessert wines. All of them were delicious. I especially recommend the ""floating island"" - airy but satisfying. Best part is that it's just a few avenues away from Penn Station, and it's quite cheap! Definitely worth checking out!",1
1802,4,4,12/15/2012,"Parisienne mussels were amazing! Â My friend ordered the Thai and was equally impressed. Â We had the ice cream puffs with warm chocolate sauce and muscat wine for dessert. Â The ice cream was a nice change from the usual cream filling. Â The bistro was cozy and really felt like you were no longer in nyc, let alone Murray Hill... =P Â We plan to return for brunch.",1
1803,4,4,12/12/2012,"A new neighborhood favorite. Â Enjoyed a dinner for 2 on a weeknight. Â I had mussels, my wife had chicken. Â Service was polite, although a bit slow (the main criticism). Â I'm generally critical of mussels, since I can prepare them well (and cheaply) at home. Â These were definitely the best mussels, to memory, I've enjoyed at a restaurant. Â My wife's chicken was well seasoned and perfectly cooked. Â You can easily pay twice as much and eat half as well for French fare in Manhattan. Â 9/10 for Murray Hill, 7/10 otherwise.",1
1804,4,4,12/9/2012,"I addition to yummy brunch...the dinner here is also really good. Last Thursday a friend and I dined here. Â We each had French Onion soup, then we split the roasted artichoke salad and salmon over lentils. Â For dessert we shared profiteroles. Â Everything we ate was really, really yummy. Â The soup was an awesome rendition of the classic recipe. Â The salmon was cooked perfectly and the salad was unique and flavorful - very different than typical starter salads. Â  Everyone here is super nice!! Â And I will definitely be going back soon.",1
1805,4,5,12/7/2012,"People keep giving negative service reviews, but the service here is awesome. I have had the same guy (manager or owner?) serve me every time I come here. Orders come quickly, they are attentive without being int eruptive to my conversation. Coffee gets filled. Turn around and nod for the check, I never once felt like I was waiting for something, and this is when the place was completely full and had two people at most working the tables. One of my favorite spots in this neighborhood. I have had dinner and brunch here.",1
1806,4,4,12/1/2012,"The entree-and-beverage-of-your-choice brunch special is now $13.95 (wampwamp) and it's worth it. Egg white and salmon gavlax omelette with herbs and french fries on the side? In. Dinner is great too. Regarding their service... come on guys. You get what you come for. You came to a very small, casual, Euro-style bistro. Not Applebee's. The owners aren't going to be at your table constantly poking you to ask if you're okay- they leave you alone to your conversation. Your coffee and water are refilled, food comes fast, they notice when you want your check. They might want to hire another waiter soon, but for now they're attentive enough for the bistro environment.",1
1807,4,1,11/29/2012,"Omg. The food is good here. The serivice, seriously, is the worst ever I've encountered in Manhattan. We made a reservation at 8, and when we were there perfectly on time, they said that the table wasn't ready. They told us to wait for 10-15 minutes. But in the end we waited for 30 minutes, without even being apologized AT ALL. So I started to ask the restaurant owner: "" do we get any discount or compensation for waiting so long?"" The owner said:"" no, This is Manhattan, and you don't give me this attitude. The door is right there, if you don't want to eat here, you can!"" Â This is ridiculous. We made the reservation because its my friend's 22nd birthday. Their bad service totally ruined our celebrative atmosphere. They might be popular, but that doesn't give them any reason to be rude. Such a shame for French restaurants. They are too rude to be rated anything more than 1 star. I am at the table now, and I am giving them zero tips.",1

1809,4,3,11/25/2012,"I live in the area and have been wanting to try this place for ages - I am a sucker for a French bistro. Â I finally had the opportunity today when a friend asked if I was available for brunch. Although the place does not take reservations (as far as I know), we got lucky and had to wait less than 5 minutes. The service was pretty decent and our drink orders were taken immediately. The price fix included one drink and in an unusual turn of events, I skipped the booze and asked for just coffee. Â My friend asked for decaf and I thought it was odd that they didn't have a regular decaf coffee but the waitress suggested my friend drink a decaf Americano instead. Â I ordered the Poached Eggs with salmon and my friend ordered the chicken sandwich. Â My eggs were extremely tasty although slightly cold but the French fries were fantastic - completely crispy without being greasy. Â The spicy mustard sauce on the side was YUM. Â My friend said her sandwich was superb. At first I felt a bit rushed - the waiter kept trying to remove my plate while I was still eating. Â Granted, my plate was empty but I was nibbling on my friend's fries. Â The price fix was a good deal, although all dishes were supposed to come with fries but for some reason, my friend's sandwich did not and she had to order them on the side. Â I also did not like that they charged my friend for her Americano since the price fix was supposed to come with either a mimosa, bloody mary or a cup of coffee/tea. Â Since decaf coffee was not available, I think her Americano should have been free but we didn't bother complaining. All in all, I thought the meal was good and the staff friendly. Â The value was pretty decent and I would probably go back.",1
1810,4,4,11/20/2012,"Oooh la la. Tres magnifique! Love this tiny spot (which is actually not all that tiny upon entry.) It's really got a great French vibe, authentic French cuisine (go for the salmon et quinoa, mes amis!) Love the crowd, the ambiance, and the not too tight spacing of the tables (which will frequently occur in small restaurants.) Very sweet and friendly hostess / waitress. I'm only giving it 4 stars though because the bathroom was pretty gnarly. I watched a program the other day which interviewed a famous restauranteur who stated that a restaurant's bathroom tidiness is entirely indicative of the restaurant's kitchen cleanliness... Just saying. But not over-thinking it because I'll go back for another visit to Le Parisien. I'll just be sure to use my home WC beforehand!",1
1811,4,5,11/18/2012,Went for dinner and it was amazing! Little french cafe with amazing food hidden in Murray hill. The chicken is to die for and so is the pork. We tried the apple tartin na dthat is the only thing that could be better...Would def come again!,1

1814,4,3,11/10/2012,"This small eatery reminds of the small bistros in France all the way down to the French speaking waiters and customers. BTW, when people of a certain ethnicity dine at a place that serve said ethnicity's food, that's always a good thing. We had a reservation, but were given a slight wait which was not a problem. The Mrs. speaks French, and they responded right back. It's always great when non-American places can speak the language of the the food they claim to serve. For dinner, we split the baby spinach salad (ok) salad, she had the mussels; mariners and parissine (she enjoyed), and Steak Frites. They give you a lot of food for the low price. Everything was tasty. The Mrs. is a wine gal, and she wasn't very impressed with a wine list. A french place with a disappointing wine list automatically gets one star taken off. Overall, it is a nice quaint spot. It's great for a date night, on the first date or after six years (like me)",1

1816,4,5,10/24/2012,"Le Parisien - Cheap brunch special in Murray Hill! (cheap in price, not value) Bottom line: Â Unbeatable $12.95 brunch special in a quaint French bistro. Tips: Â  Â The French toast is incredible! Â  Â $12.95 brunch special includes one drink Â  Â The restaurant is small and gets packed so make a reservation if you can About: Â Le Parisien is a neighborhood gem in the heart of Murray Hill. Â A small, quaint bistro with delicious food and rustic French decor, you feel like you're no longer in Manhattan as you take advantage of the unbeatable brunch special. Â For just $12.95 you will get an entree and a drink (mimosa, OJ, coffee, or sangria)! Â Chef Johnathan Masse, who comes from the Waverly Inn, does a great job bringing a comfort-food flare to this French bistro. Food/Drink: Â While everyone loved their brunch, the French toast was the clear winner! Â The food came out in a timely manner, and our coffees were refilled almost before we knew we were out. Â  Â French toast - With warm vanilla maple syrup, thinly sliced bananas and apple compote. Â This was sooo yummy! Â The apple compote tasted like apricot to me, and it was such a unique taste that went perfectly with the dish. Â Loved how the bananas were sliced very thin so that they don't overpower when you take a bite. Â This leads to the question... do the French really make the best French toast?... Â  Â Omelets - Both the herbs & roasted veggies omelet and the ham & cheese omelet were bit hits. Â The spinach was particularly tasty in the herbs & roasted veggies omelet, but the egg wasn't cooked evenly throughout the omelet. Â The ham & cheese omelet came with gruyere which added a flavor you don't normally get in this basic type of omelet. Â  Â Poached eggs with salmon - On an English muffin with hollandaise sauce. Â We loved the crisp muffins and the eggs that tasted farm-fresh. Â The eggs were cooked to perfection and the hollandaise sauce was well-balanced. Â Also enjoyed the crispy French fries and salad that came with the dish. Â  Â Eggs benedict - With Canadian bacon and hollandaise sauce - gets two thumbs up. Atmosphere: Â Except for the unsightly, tiny restroom that is basically in the kitchen, I can't say anything negative about the atmosphere here. Â It was a bit loud and only as people cleared out did we notice music playing in the background. Â While the restaurant itself is small, it doesn't seem cramped. Â Instead, it actually has an intimate, romantic feel, and would be great for a day date.",1

We came around two and there was a short wait, but after that, we were quickly seated and excited. Service was quick and the whole French cafe ambience was fantastic. All of us ordered the brunch special. I had the Poached Eggs with Salmon Gravlax on English Muffins with Hollandaise Sauce with the sangria. The sangria was delicious and after just half of a glass, the warmth began spreading over my cheeks. I love poached eggs and salmon and thoroughly enjoyed my dish.

1821,4,3,10/14/2012,I went to Le Parisien for brunch today and it was ok but nothing special. The decor could use some updating and the place seemed dirty to me. It was your standard brunch fare but nothing to write home about. There are better brunch options in Murray Hill.,1
1822,4,4,10/8/2012,Very traditional French menu. Food was fantastic!,1
1823,4,4,10/7/2012,"As i was walking in the neighborhood, I decided to got for brunch at le parisien today. Not only it is a great $ deal but food is awesome, and we love the cozy athmosphere, which always reminds me of my trips to Paris. Great food, fast service and a pleasant team. Will recommend to anyone ""Parfait"" as i believe says the French :-)",1
1824,4,5,10/2/2012,"I've only been there for Brunch, and it was awesome! The egg dishes are delicious, so are the salad and fries that come with. The bottomless coffee they serve with the brunch is fresh and tasty. My friend ordered a sandwich, that was delicious as well. I can't wait to go back there for a proper French meal. This is a great neighborhood restaurant ran by real French people. The ambiance inside reminds me of restaurants in France.",1
1825,4,3,9/28/2012,"A charming spot, a welcoming staff, low noise level, good wine at a reasonable price...if only the food was better! The mussels were not very tasty (fresh?), the onion soup bland, the soup de jour very good, the bread so-so. The duck confit: very nicely served on frisee which overlaid thinly sliced potatoes. But, the duck was overcooked --tasty but dry and tough, the potatoes were not hot (chilled by the salad perhaps); the salad Â with wonderful mushrooms was delicious. Coffees great, apple tart poor, not fresh.",1
1826,4,2,9/23/2012,"I was excited to come here when I saw it got 93% on Urban Spoon and when reviews described it as a nice departure to Paris in the confines of Murray Hill. However, this was NOT at all my experience. The French Toast was mediocre to say the least - I could have made better at home. The bread looked flattened and carelessly served. It was topped with little pieces of apple compote and maple syrup on the side. Don't get me wrong, it tasted fine but the presentation totally turned me off as I was expecting some fresh fruit or something remotely exciting to compliment it! I guess for $12.95 I can't be too picky about what I'm getting but in comparison to most brunch spots I've been to in the City the French Toast here was really embarrassing. To be fair, I haven't tried their other dishes but let's just say I'm not excited to go back.",1
1827,4,2,9/17/2012,"Me and my friend had brunch at Le Parisien. Food: We ordered classic egg benedict and french toast. The classic egg benedict was way too salty and the only good part was the fries that came with it. As for the french toast, it was a small portion and only served with maple syrup. The toast was overcooked and I can make a better toast at home. Service: Terrible! The waiter asked my friend at least 5 times if he could take his plate away (with an unpleasant tone) while there were still a lot of food left and we were just having a conversation. I could understand if there were people waiting to get into the restaurant but there weren't any people outside. It was very rude. Bottom line: Will not go back again.",1
1828,4,4,9/16/2012,"Cute little French restaurant in Murray Hill. The prices are very reasonable for the area and the food is consistently solid. Also, you can't beat their brunch deal - $12.95 for an entree plus mimosa, coffee, sangria, or oj. The eggs florentine come with a lightly dressed salad and skinny fries that are cooked to crunchy perfection. The french toast is fluffy and pairs well with the apple compote's sourness. The owner is French so you can guarantee the authenticity of the food. The space is quite small but not stuffy. We came here with about 8 ppl for dinner and were easily seated. The wait has never been more than 5-10 minutes which is a plus. This is definitely a needle in a haystack. For those with cars, there's parking right in front and it's free on one side M-F after 6 PM and all day Sat-Sun. The other side is free pretty much all day sans street cleaning however there's rarely a spot open. Bon appetit!",1
1829,4,5,9/10/2012,"Full disclosure: I didn't really eat here. Â I met some friends for a Sunday Brunch, and coincidentally 2 out of the 3 of them I joined for Sunday Brunch a week earlier in their hometown of San Diego. Â And my biggest complaint at that place was that my coffee kept going empty, and when I get a coffee (or a water for that matter) at a restaurant, I want it constantly filled. Â Le Parisien did not disappoint, as the staff kept filling my cup. Â It was heaven. The brunch deal is not bad, either. Â $13 includes a choice of meals plus a coffee or mimosa. Â It was very tempting, but I wasn't hungry, yet. Â I did try a few bites of my friend's croque monsieur and it was pretty amazing. Â It actually left me bummed that I didn't order a proprer meal. Â Next time.",1
1830,4,3,8/27/2012,"For someone who typically doesn't eat omlettes, this was a pleasant surprise. Â Since most of the brunch options were omlettes, we tried the wild mushroom omlette and the spinach omlette (both with cheese). Â Both were excellent, and we were happy with the overall deal. Â We didn't understand the Yelp ""Deal"" since the ""special"" price we got from Yelp was the regular price, but they succeeded in getting us in the door. Â And we're happy we found it, because it was a nice place. Â My friend and I had just been to Paris a few months before, and this place did give us a feeling that we were back in one of those cute French cafes. Â They accepted Amex too, which was nice. Â Overall, I was happy, and will probably be back there for brunch. Â I liked this place more than Penelope, which typically has a longer wait, and seems more expensive.",1
1831,4,5,8/22/2012,"A nice piece of Paris, a walk away from home in NYC. Excellent dinner here with my boyfriend for our anniversary. Made reservations and we were seated right away. Waiter was very attentive and very french. We ordered a bottle of Chardonnay, suggested to us by the server. We had the duck pate and french onion soup to start. Both were delicious! Pate was flavorful and well presented, and the soup was piping hot and yummy. For our main, we ordered the Parisienne PEI mussels and the duck confit. The duck was perfection! A perfectly cooked thigh and leg with super crispy skin served on a bed of frisse. The mussels were very largely portioned and the saffron mustard sauce was great for dipping the bread in. We ended the meal with creme brulee and apple tart a la mode. Great laid back dinner with fine fine food. Will definitely be back very soon to try their brunch menu and many meals to come!",1
1832,4,4,8/20/2012,"So glad I finally tried this spot out. Kind of a strange location (feels like it belongs more in the west village than murray hill) and doesn't look like much from the exterior, but once inside, this restaurant is a little slice of paris and perfect for a quiet dinner for two. I ordered the steak frites: the steak was tender and flavorful, and the fries were a bit overcooked but still good. My friend had the moules frites which was also pretty decent. Service was good and we didn't feel rushed even though we lingered awhile. Will definitely be back for brunch.",1
1833,4,5,8/19/2012,"~ $13.00 for one brunch meal + coffee (or mimosa). Â Oh if only the mimosa were included, I'd be 200 % satisfied, but coffee plus free refills does it for me anyway :-) I love my crazy amounts of protein when it comes to brunch, and eggs just seem to be my NYC brunch craving. Â  We were a party of 6, and didn't make a reservation. Â Brunch service starts at ~ NOON, and we all arrived at 12:15-ish and were still able to be seated right away (phew!). Â  Did I feel like I was warped into a Parisian bistro across the ocean? Â Hmm...but I will dream anyway :-)",1
1834,4,4,8/19/2012,Mussels with frites were incredible. Infused with fresh thyme celery onion and garlic. Cream broth light and very flavorful. Highly recommend. Nice and casual no pretense,1
1835,4,4,8/16/2012,"Came here specifically for the steak frites and was not disappointed! While the restaurant is very small (cozy?), our severs were great and very knowledgable. Â Our waitress was a little unsure about the 2010 Bordeaux (apparently it wasn't a very good year) we were thinking of and instead suggested a comprable bottle to taste. Â It was delicious and exactly what we were looking for in flavor. The bread was a little chewy, the type that sticks to your teeth but would be great with mussels. Â The steak frites was very good; tender even though it is a tough cut of meat and the fries absorbed the sauce giving them a great flavor. Â  Looking forward to trying their brunch.",1
1836,4,4,8/12/2012,Love this place for brunch. Great service and good food for a reasonable price. What more could you ask for?,1
1837,4,4,8/11/2012,"I can't believe I've never stumbled across this tiny, unassuming Parisian bistro in my neighborhood! The prices are fantastic (ally low) - $12.95 for a ton of different brunch options that includes a mimosa, OJ, sangria, or coffee. My boyfriend and I opted for the brunch special of salmon gravlax over English muffins topped with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. The fries and greens that it came with were divine. Crispy and not greasy, I downed my entire plate! The service was friendly. I really enjoyed it! What a great neighborhood gem.",1
1838,4,4,8/1/2012,"I can't believe I've lived here for so long and not stumbled upon this place for brunch. It's small, like a neighborhood cafÃ©, but also has great service and a solid brunch menu. I got the poached eggs with salmon gravlax on English muffins (hollandaise sauce on the side) and it was so delicious and the perfect portion. It also came with some greens and really fried fries. The fries were okay and crunchy and oily enough on a day you are just so hungry you cannot have enough. I love the casualness of this place and the no-crazy-wait for a seat, plus it is great to come with a friend and have a good time without feeling hurried. The Kips Bay movie theater is literally a block away.",1
1839,4,5,7/31/2012,Highly recommend!! Visited on a Thursday night while in the city. We were greeted by the owner upon entering and seated immediately. The walls are covered in French decor - one poster looked to be of the owner - and the restaurant is small but intimate. The frittes and fries were amazing. Frittes was tender and the fries were the best we had ever had - hands down! Also ordered the pork in lime sauce which was very good and different then anything else I've ever had. Lots of dishes seem intriguing and different. By the time we left the restaurant was filled. Definitely suggest making a reservation if possible.,1
1840,4,5,7/30/2012,"Great atmosphere, delicious food. Usually come for their pre fixe brunch and it's a great menu with very tasty drinks included. The eggs benedict is a winner, as well as the french toast. My friends have given terrific reviews for the steak frits and chicken dish from the dinner menu also. The french fries are delicious and the French Onion Soup is some of the best I've had. Our waiter has been this charismatic French guy almost every time we've been here and is part of what makes dining her such a great experience. We come at least twice a month for brunch and occasionally dinner. Will definitely keep coming.",1
1841,4,4,7/20/2012,"had brunch here a while ago, good service, good food at a great price. I think it was $12.5 for a drink and an entree. But it was very small and it was very hot inside on a summer day, which was annoying.",1
1842,4,3,7/18/2012,Great local spot.,1
1843,4,3,7/18/2012,"We came in on a Tuesday night after being told there was an hour and a half wait at neighboring Cask. The restaurant was fairly empty and seemed well-priced, so we settled in for a relaxed dinner at this small, charming French restaurant. A friend and I ordered the special they were having - the pappardelle with mushrooms and spinach in a cream sauce... overall, I thought the dish was good (but not great). I was ready to eat after walking around all day, but the cream sauce was rich enough that the plate felt overly indulgent. Another friend at our table ordered the mussels, which came as a heaping portion in its own pot - very cute! The service was great - the manager kept stopping by to check on us, and let us finish our conversation well after the meal had ended, despite a growing crowd at the restaurant.",1
1844,4,4,7/16/2012,"Having visited Paris shortly before I ate here for the first time, I can tell you that this place is very authentically Paris. I have since eaten here again and again and not once has the food or wine disappointed. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is very intimate. Even my parents, who are old school Chinese and eat only Asian food, loved this place. The prices are reasonable for the kind of dining experience they provide. Will definitely come back on a weekend to try their brunch. A Croque Madame sounds pretty good right now.",1
1845,4,4,7/12/2012,"I visited this small hidden gem last week. What a delightful surprise. From the outside, it looks like a very small outdated restaurant. But as soon as you step foot inside, you feel the french style start to take over. We ordered the escargot and duck pate as appetizers, both were delicious and authentic. Escargot was light with only a little bit of herb and garlic oil and the pate was delicious with the cornichons (small pickles). Only suggestion for the pate is to ask for more bread, it wasn't enough to enjoy the pate fully. Since I wanted to try something new, I order the Thai mussel pot and my friend ordered pork tenderloin. My mussel pot came with fries which a little disappointing. The tenderloin was absolutely delicious. I would recommend it to everyone. The best of my entire dinner was the dessert...We had profiteroles. It's ice cream puff with warm chocolate sauce pour over it. DELICIOUS! MUST GET! It was so delicious my friend and I didn't say anything until the dish was finish. We were there on a Tuesday around 5:30pm. No wait. But it did get quite busy by the time we left which was around 7...The tables are close to each other so I would assume it would be quite nosy when it gets busy.",1
1846,4,4,6/28/2012,"BRUNCH REVIEW: I've never been to Paris, but Le Parisien paints the picture in my mind of what it might look like. Â My friend & I managed to get the humongous open air window seat on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Â It's $12.95 for a dish + mimosa, mary, oj, or caffee. Â Eggs benedict & croque monsieur, both REALLY tasty. Â The Sangria was a little weak for my liking, but I SUPPOSE my liver can use a break. Â Service was very friendly and casual, definitely my style. Â I'm coming back for dinner, be on your game Le Parisien (that's when the Yelp claws come out).",1
1847,4,4,6/27/2012,"I really like the food here and the restaurant's ambiance lives up to its name - very quaint. The brunch here is pretty good. I would say, try the spinach omelet with goat cheese...sooo good.",1
1848,4,4,6/21/2012,"Love the brunch here. Â French people know food. Â My boyfriend and I come here almost every other week. Â We have tried almost every item on the brunch menu and nothing has disappointed us so far. Â Also love the fact that they have wifi here. Â :-) Â Not giving them 5-star is because of the single dinner experience. Â We ordered a few appetizers, which were good but not impressive. Â My boyfriend ordered the steak and he enjoyed it. Â I ordered the special, monkfish wrapped by bacon slices. Â It does sound yummy (and that's why three people in the group ordered it), but didn't taste as good. Â We love the people working there. Â Will come back to try stuff on the regular dinner menu and if something surprises me, I will review again. Â :-)",1
1849,4,4,6/17/2012,This is truly a hidden gem in the neighborhood. Went there for a special occasion based on the good reviews on Yelp and was glad I picked this place. The decor is nothing fancy. The wait staff (a French lady) was very helpful and refilled our water very promptly (always important). We had a bottle of bordeaux; the onion soup and salad which was on special for starters. The onion soup was okay & the salad was fantastic. I had the steak & frites as entree and it was very delicious. Steak was very tender- cooked to perfection. Frites were shoestring fries - very French. We also had mussels at the table and it was very good. I forgot the name of the dessert we shared but it was their recommendation and it was also quite good. Price very reasonable - everything came to about 110$ plus gratuity. We'd definitely come back again maybe to try their brunch!,1
1850,4,4,6/17/2012,"BF and I went for Saturday brunch after finding out a nearby spot was 45min-1hr wait. Firstly, there was NO wait here = +1. Very cozy spot and brunch prix fixe is $12.95 = +1. We got the grilled porto-mushroom sandwich w/ pesto sauce and the eggs benedict w/ smoked salmon. Both were very tasty = +1. Â Waiters were just attentive and friendly enough without being too lurky = +1. Â My only 2 suggestions for improvement are: Â OJ was not fresh. BF said it tasted like Minute Maid and I agreed after sipping. A quaint, French spot like this should have freshly squeezed OJ, IMHO. Also, when I yelped, there was an advertised Yelp check-in special of ""$12.95 brunch "". When we got there, we found out it's not a check-in special. It's just their weekend brunch special for everyone. Maybe that should be revised. Â Otherwise, we had a fantastic time dining here and will definitely be back, to try their other menu items.",1
1851,4,5,6/17/2012,"This was my first real French restaurant. I have to agree with others, it's like stepping into Paris for a moment. The moment you walk in, the owner greets you with french and sit me right away (it was Sunday night at seven, not really busy). We ordered: -French onion soup: authentic, so if you are used to chain restaurants like TGIF, then you will feel it has less taste and more bland. -Le Parisien salad with Vinaigrette dressing: delicious. I always love european salads! -2 of their daily special fish: my favorite was the spinach pea puree with special house made lemon sauce! DELICIOUS! I read many reviews and they suggested their mussels was something to order, but I mean mussels will always be mussels. If you are going to try French, do their special of the day, you can never go wrong with that! It is definitely a place to have dinner with a few friends, its not a place where I would like to go on a date. More homey than romantic. My first real French cuisine and I love it!",1
1852,4,3,6/17/2012,"Cozy environment, OK food, fair wine. Make sure you get a reservation, the seating is rather limited.",1
1853,4,3,6/8/2012,def would come back here. nice little quaint restaurant. Duck country pate was crazy delish Couscous was goood but be ready for a curry flavored dish. Duck confit was da bombz but just one duck drum stick??? Really????!,1
1854,4,4,6/4/2012,"Absolutely yummy. Really excellent food in a very cute and relaxing atmosphere. The restaurant is quite small, but it doesn't feel cramped.They really know how to maximize the space. I was craving Moules Frites and my friend was craving Steak Frites. He was very satisfied, and so was I. I recommend the Parissienne flavor - saffron and mustard cream, a bit rich, very flavorful. Not shy at all on the Saffron. The Mussels were plentiful and perfectly cooked. The Frites, as other reviewers have mentioned, are deee-vine. Seriously. I was very full from the mussels, but I HAD TO FINISH my frites. They were so delicious. I usually use those little friend potatoes to pick up the leftover juices of the mussels, but no no, I didn't want to mess with the crispy goodness. They were perfect. Note: I've been before for their brunch special (~$13 for a beverage and entree). Not too shabby.",1
1855,4,4,6/4/2012,"I came here for brunch and had a great experience. Â We got there right as the restaurant opened at noon and there was already a group of 5 - 6 people waiting to be seated. Â We were quickly seated at a table by the large window, next to the entrance. Â The weather couldn't have been better so it was the perfect spot to enjoy partial al fresco dining. Â We ordered from the prix fixe brunch menu and had the eggs benedict and poached eggs with salmon. Â Both were delicious and came with a bunch of fresh greens and crispy fries. Â The restaurant itself is cute and cozy and the atmosphere is laid back and relaxed. Â I will have to come back and try dinner.",1
1856,4,4,5/31/2012,"sssh!! Â  Â It's such a small place. Â A piece of Paris. Â You want ambiance? Â You want wonderful food? Â Great wine? Â All at a reasonable price? Â We love the mussels and frites as well as the chicken. Â The bread soooo good. Â ssssh, don't tell anyone else.",1
1857,4,4,5/30/2012,"This was definitely an unexpected surprise in the neighborhood. Very much trying to emulate a more realistic french setting without the pretentiousness, and providing more authentic and flavorful food, Le Parisien succeeds on both accounts. We had the raw beef plate as an appetizer...DELICIOUS! If some friends in your party are reluctant to try it but you're all for it, convince your friends it will make them a better person - it's worth trying! We had two types of mussel pots: one was thai and the other I can't remember...that just goes to show how memorable the latter was. I would say the thai flavor they offer is worth trying if only for the reason that it doesn't seem to be offered in many other places. And of course, the frites were solid too. Lastly, the service was great; the waitress was very willing to help us figure out what on the menu we might like best without being pushy or biased - can't ask for more than that!",1
1858,4,5,5/30/2012,"I took my parents here for dinner and even though we were running late, the hostess told me to take our time and we were seated right away. It was quite charming and with the door and window open, the breezes took us away to a mini getaway. We shared a bottle of wine, multiple appetizers and all had the Steak Frites. It was tender and cooked perfectly for medium (rarely do I ever find a steak cooked the way I like it). I would love to go back to try their brunch. Overall, it was a very nice experience and I will definitely be back.",1
1859,4,3,5/25/2012,"I was on the hunt for good french onion soup and chose this restaurant because of the reviews. Â I was disappointed. Â The soup broth was slightly sweet but not rich and meaty as I was hoping. Â The garlic was in large chunks and not finely chopped, which I interpreted as sloppy cooking. Â The steak tartar was subpar and had too much dill and garlic. Â The accompanying fries were ok - they had a slightly nutty flavor (from peanut oil?). Â The chicken dish somewhat redeemed the restaurant. Â It was moist and perfectly seared so that the skin was slightly crisp. Â It came with a subtle but tasty sauce. Â The restaurant itself was small but cute; what you imagine it would be like inside a Paris bistro.",1
1860,4,2,5/22/2012,The food is always delicious-wine choices nice. Ambience is like being in Paris BUT as I was taking a last piece of butter out of the round metal container I noticed there was ketchup in the bottom. Not the best. Made me wonder what else wasn't clean. It could have been worse and we got a free glass of wine. I will still go back. It's a gem.,1
1861,4,4,5/20/2012,We had a reservation and were seated right away. The place is nicely decorated. The lighting and ambience makes you feel like you're at a quaint little place in Paris. The owner who helped us herself is a French lady so that explains a lot of things. Huge wine selection. We decided to be a little adventurous and tried a bottle of South African red. It was tart but good. We had the pate appetizer and it was very good. They mix in pistachio and serve it with this thick dark sauce around the plate and bread. I had the mussels. It came in a huge bowl! I opted for the white wind sauce option and I was in heaven! I ate every single piece and dipped countless piece of bread in that amazing sauce. If I ever go back there I would have to go just to eat the mussels again. My sister had the fish. It was just okay in comparison to the mussels. The price was actually very reasonable for th area. Our bill for 2 came to about $90 after tax and tip.,1
1862,4,5,5/14/2012,"My wife daughter and I put in Google ""French"" for near her apartment , and this came up. We went, and thought it had mistakenly sent us to Paris. Like time travel, it was superb, manager/proprietor made us welcome (last ones in @ lunch closing), and kept kitchen open til we ordered. OMG, everything we got was wonderful, and my wife and daughter complimented me on my find. (Which they very rarely do-snooty women). So, my daughter is graduating next week, and that is the first place we will meet upon our arrival in NYC! Can't wait.",1

But they are so much better then all of us in one thing Â - hedonism. Forget about austerity - live here, now...and take all the pleasure you can get from life. Was always curious to check this place out. So on monday night I decided to go there for a glass of nice french rose wine and fois gras, to celebrate life!) The place is pretty tiny, but the atmosphere looks authentic. Reminds of all those french bistros with art deco style posters on the walls. Nice music. The wine was chilled and tasted great pairing with tender fois gras, served with crunchy cornichons, toasted baguette, mixed greens sprinkled with balsamic vinaigrette. I also tried their mussels in white wine with garlic, served with pomme frittes. Delicious. My friend tried their duck confit. I stole a piece, so believe me it's divine! The service was nice, very attentive and polite. Definitely will come back! Their brunch special looks good, so maybe thats what I'll try next. Merci, Le Parisien",1
1864,4,4,5/8/2012,"I came here for a birthday brunch with a friend. Be warned that they don't take reservations for Sunday brunch but the wait wasn't too long. This is a tiny place so the turnover is quite fast. That said, if you're looking for a place to nurse a few mimosas for two hours, this isn't the place for you. The brunch menu is pretty basic, but for 12.95, you get a decent amount of choices. We had the Eggs Florentine and the Poached Eggs with Salmon Gravlax. Their hollandaise sauce is... in a word...delicious. The side of crispy fries was a yummy bonus. Also, every brunch order comes with a complimentary sangria, coffee, or mimosa too! What could be better! I would come back again, and would definitely like to try their dinner menu.",1
1865,4,5,5/8/2012,"From beginning to end, this restaurant is simply delightful. I came here on a double date with my S.O. and his out of town friends. Some highlights: --When calling to make reservations, the owner (an awesome French lady who doesn't seem to age) answers with an enthusiastic ""Bonjour!!"" and is super helpful and friendly. Just based on this encounter, I would dispel all my assumptions about ""rude French people"" --The ambiance: I've never been to France, but our friend has...she said it reminded her of a classic French cafe. It's tiny, and you're sitting super close to everyone. The walls are decorated with posters of French movies and such. Very, very, cute and chic. --In true European style, they let you linger. There is ample time between appetizer and entree, and of course you have to wait forever for the check. It's awesome not to feel rushed in a Manhattan restaurant. Now, the amazing French food: --The French onion soup comes piping hot out of the oven. It's extremely flavorful, down to all the elements: it has a sweet onion-y broth, a soggy but crusty crouton, and gooey cheese. --I tried steak tartare for the first time. It was quite an experience. It came with an egg yolk in a half shell, salad and a big heap of fries on the side. The ""steak"" was interesting...I have nothing to compare it to, but I think I liked it. The fries are out of this world..very potato-y and fancy. --We also got a dessert ""profit""something...it was everything you'd want in a French pastry The bill for 4, with 2 bottles of wine, was $200. That seems ok given the quality of food. Definitely come here for a special occasion when you have a few hours to linger and enjoy!",1
1866,4,4,5/3/2012,This is a cute little French place with friendly service and good food. Â It's a nice place for a quiet lunch.,1
1867,4,1,5/1/2012,"The waiter was sarcastic and dismissive of us and repeatedly suggested we get a bottle of wine instead of two glasses. He was pushy to the point of being forceful. My onion soup was good, but our table was rickety and uneven and tipped back and forth every time someone put their elbows down so a lot of the soup spilled onto the table and the floor. In addition, we were very concerned about the B cleanliness rating considering that even an A rating allows for a lot of less than desirable findings in the kitchen. Overall this was a very bad dining experience, which was particularly disappointing since I live around the corner and was hoping to go back!",1
1868,4,4,4/29/2012,"Right off the bat, I just have to say that this place is adorable. Â As a male, that's not a word I use often, so I mean it when I say it. Â The restaurant is a quaint and cozy, with only a few tables inside and lots of vintage art and posters. Â To make the experience all the better, there always seems to be at least one customer in there speaking French. Â It could be a gimmick, it could be the owner, I don't know and I don't care because it just makes my dining experience that much better (although it also makes me sad that I do not speak French). Â  In terms of food, the brunch menu is reasonably priced at $12.95 with a choice of OJ, mimosa (for which they don't skimp on the champagne), sangria, or coffee. Â The menu has all the classics--eggs florentine, frittatas, salmon benedict, and croque monsieur to name but a few--most of which are served with fries and mixed greens. Â And they don't screw up most of your eggs like a lot of places. Â The poached eggs neither instantly explode at the touch of a fork nor do they resemble a nearly hardboiled egg staring back at you (which is the worst). Â I only wish the had a wider selection on their price-fixed menu, but I suppose it's better to do a few things well that a bunch of things mediocre. Not the best place for a large group, but a wonderfully charming, affordable brunch stop for a party of 2-4, with great service to boot. Â I hope to visit for dinner one day soon!",1

1870,4,5,4/19/2012,Very quaint and amazing food. Able to provide a little taste of Paris in NYC.,1
1871,4,4,4/17/2012,"I love this quaint, cozy Parisian restaurant! The menu offers great classics at reasonable prices. The escargot was the best I've ever had. The chicken was tender and juicy. The mussels were cooked well but the white wine sauce wasn't what I'd expected though it could be because I'm used to the less creamy version usually served at other restaurants. The service is warm and friendly. My only complaint was that the open air space turned the food cold quick!",1
1872,4,4,4/9/2012,On the first night of a two-night stay I and 2 co-workers found this place. As we left after our wonderful meal we decided we'd come back again for our second night. This is unusual for me since I like to try as many restaurants as I can. But the cusine was very good and the staff was welcoming.,1
1873,4,4,4/2/2012,"Very good brunch deal. Â No reservations for brunch, but the wait wasn't too bad for a group of 4 around 1230 Saturday morning. Â There are always like 1-2 groups waiting but if you are a group of 2 it looked like you could get a seat right away. Â Your full group must be there to get seated. Â They were very strict on this. $12.95 for a meal + drink (sangria, mimosa, coffee, OJ). Â The options all looked quite tasty and came with fries and a salad. Â  +My sister got the eggwhite with salmon- She said it was good, can't screw up a basic thing like that. +My mom got the french toast which was actually pretty good (I ate basically half of hers). Â The only downside is that one of the french toasts wasn't fully cooked and raw inside...but overall the dish was yummy and comes with an apple compote on top. Â It's no Exra Virgin french toast though. +I had the gruyere and ham omellete. Â Very buttery but we are at a french place so what do I expect. Â I would opt more for the Croque next time but I was trying to be healthy with the egg...drat! Â  +My friend had the egg florentine...she gobbled that up and said it was pretty good. Â  Additional comments: We all liked the fries...We saw many people getting the Frittata and it looked REALLY GOOD. Â The mimosas were proportioned well. Â The OJ is not fresh squeezed. Â All 4 of us finished everything off of our plates..if you are a guy you may still be hungry. OVERALL: Â Price wise, a very good deal and decent to good food. Â  The ambiance is cute..very Parisian bistro-ish. Â The service was okay. Â I like that we didn't have to wait too long.",1
1874,4,4,3/30/2012,"I love this spot for brunch. It is a truly quaint and peaceful spot for Murray Hill. The crowd ranged from elderly women who are clearly regulars, young couples and small groups of friends. The service was attentive and accommodating, the atmosphere was warm and authentic. Definitely didn't feel like I was right off of 3rd avenue. The prefixe brunch deal ($12.95 Â for a meal + Mimosa/Bloody Mary/Coffee or Tea) is great.",1
1875,4,4,3/24/2012,"Oh my! This place is teeny tiny. Be sure to get here before 12:30 because it fills up pretty quickly. I wanted to pretend Paul H. and I were in another city so I made a lunch reservation here. :) This place was surprisingly delicious. The bistrot steak was better than I could ever have imagined and the endive salad was bitter, sweet, and refreshing. This is definitely not a cheap and quick lunch but we managed to leave unscathed in under an hour. I noticed other patrons were nibbling on bread- we were not offered any so if you're famished (we weren't) you should definitely ask for some. :)",1

FOOD: 4.5/5 -ENDIVE SALAD with roasted pears, roquefort cheese, walnuts and port vinaigrette: the walnuts were sweet which helped balance out the vinaigrette. The pears weren't sweet but juicy. The endive added the extra crunch. -BISTROT STEAK FRITES with red wine thyme sauce and carmelized shallots: I had this medium rare and it was cooked right. The meat was tender and easy to chew. The frites were cooked perfectly. No excess grease/oil and when mixed with the red wine thyme sauce, perfecto! -Get both dishes to balance each other out.",1
1877,4,5,3/22/2012,"My hubby and I love this charming bistro and are becoming regulars! Â (It's so exciting to become a Regular somewhere, you know?) Â Pretty much always packed, it's a true neighborhood gem. Â There are often people waiting outside for a table on frosty winter weekend evenings. Â They take reservations in advance (but none the day-of, I don't think.) Â Would definitely recommend making a rese! Â Otherwise the wait can be a little bit of torture, as you sit there smelling all the delicious food. Â Weekend brunch is a great deal - the grilled chicken sandwich with tomato, arugula, asiago cheese, and tomato vinaigrette is my favorite! Â (Thinking of it right now makes my stomach growl.) Â For dinner, I recommend the beet salad (very fresh!) and classic French onion soup for appetizers and my hubby always gets the escargot. Â My entire family loves the filet of sole for the entree (especially my dad, who doesn't like French food in general). Â The specials tend to be quite good. Â We haven't had a chance to try the mussels yet - all the other dishes are that yummy! Â  Love the French service - they leave you alone to talk. Â Refills of water are fairly frequent, though they may need a hint, depending on how chaotic it is in there. Â We have some favorite wines on their wine list. Â  One of our favorite tables is the one by the window! Â Also note, the bathroom is quite small in the back right corner. Â  Overall, very cozy and great for many occasions (date spot, dinner with parents, brunch with friends, etc.).",1
1878,4,5,3/20/2012,"My friends and I split the escargot, and I had the roast chicken and apple tart. Â One friend had the sole, and she absolutely loved it.

1879,4,4,3/3/2012,"Unassuming little place in an unexpected location. I'd probably walked by it million times without taking note, but all the positive reviews on Yelp caught my eye. I came here with 2 friends for dinner midweek. The space is small and the tables are close together, so it's better for small parties (or dates!). I wasn't very hungry that night, but I tried a little bit of everything on the table and thought it was all delicious. I lived in France for a few years and while that doesn't make me an authority by any means, I definitely know what I like. And I reallyyyyy liked Le Parisien. The restaurant seems to be run by a very friendly, very French husband and wife team who do all of the serving. Highly recommended!",1
1880,4,2,3/2/2012,"I have to say, I was disappointed by my visit to Le Parisien. After walking past and wanting to try this cute French place for years, I finally suggested that two girlfriends and I come here for a late brunch last Saturday. While the friendly buzz and cozy decor were perfectly charming, the authentically-French service left something to be desired. I'm a pretty undemanding diner, but have to admit that I found the lack of attention from the waiter/host pretty annoying. After all, the tiny cafe was not full, and it still took 20 minutes for him to acknowledge us after we sat down. The poached eggs and salmon with hollandaise was certainly tasty, but the accompanying fries were cold, so I didn't eat much of them. And, weird as it may be to complain about this, the tap water tasted gross.",1
1881,4,5,2/26/2012,"I break from my vegetarian diet for French food, so I am always happy to find a place that has such well-executed classics. Le Parisien features deliciously prepared escargots, poulet rÃ´ti, and moules mariniÃ¨res. The moules Parisiennes were also quite good (with mustard and saffron cream sauce), but there is something so wonderful about the classic mariniÃ¨res. These were accompanied by herb seasoned frites, which is a style of French fries that I'm seeing in many restaurants these days, and enjoying very much. The first time I tried to eat at Le Parisien was a Saturday around 7, and there was absolutely no room for me and my friends. My recommendation is to arrive for an early dinner before a show or a movie. When my friends and I showed up at 5:30 on Thursday, we were the only ones there for the first 20-30 minutes, and it was packed by the time we left.",1
1882,4,4,2/24/2012,"I was craving something different this week and for the first time ever I decided to try French cuisine. Â I must say that after spending an evening at Le Parisien I later told my boyfriend ""After eating in this place, I am going to move to France"". Â Please note I have never been to France, nor do I know french. This cozy little French bistro has the kindest wait staff ever. Â My friend and I ordered a bottle of red wine, which the waitress let me taste to see if it was to my liking. Â I ordered filet of sole in a lemon and butter sauce with green beans and almonds. Â My friend ordered frittes and steak. Â She said her food was excellent. Â I practically inhaled my plate. Â The only critique I truly have is for the price, my fish was really small portioned. Â I was hungry later. Â Honestly though, I was having such a great time I did not care. For dessert, we split a merengue thing the waitress describes as ""heaven"". Â And I tell you, it was nothing less. I will most certainly be back here to take advantage of their prix fixe brunch for $12.95 for sure!",1
1883,4,4,2/20/2012,"Very cute place. Scratch that. Quaint place! Frequented by REAL French people, run by REAL French people (but also exceptionally friendly, attentive and fast), and real french food. Only the baguette wasn't as real, or at least it was pretty old. I had the carpaccio, which was super thin and delicious, and topped with arugula, cheese, and - surprise - thinly sliced green beans with mushrooms. I've never had it like that, and I liked it! Then I had the mussels with garlic and white wine sauce, which was succulent and satisfying. No room left for dessert, especially after I read on Foursquare that the cream of the cream brulee is served cold, which is not how I personally prefer it. In short, what I loved most about Le Parisien is that is does feel like a REAL transplant from Paris. Go try it out!",1
1884,4,5,2/18/2012,"The place is small so it wouldn't be good for big groups but I like it quaint and cozy. Everything I ate here was absolutely perfect and I finished EVERY SINGLE PLATE. I started with the le parisien salad with vinaigrette dressing and got the pappardelle pasta with roasted cherry tomatoes, basil, and asiago cheese. For dessert, we got some warm cream puffs with vanilla ice cream on the inside, drenched in chocolate (don't know the name because they didn't give us a dessert menu and the waiter just told us what they had). Waiters were nice and friendly. It's a bit pricey, but worth the experience. Can't wait to go again :D",1

Â I have had the beet salad, onion soup and other apps: all good. Â I come back for a reason; it's close to my apt., it's good food that's easy and it's a relaxing restaurant. Â Easy in, easy out. Â Not for 50th wedding anniversaries (take her to Jean Georges) but on every other day of the week, I'd say here's a good spot.",1
1886,4,3,2/12/2012,"I love French food. I absolutely love it. In fact, I consider myself somewhat of a Francophile. It was last minute and my friends and I wanted to go out to in the city, on a Friday night, without reservations. This really limited the amount of places we could go to. After a while, after looking through opentable, I settled on Le Parisien. The decor is quite lovely, and the restaurant has a nice, cozy French bistro feeling. Now onto the food. My first dish was a special, it was a dish of fried oysters with risotto, all fried together. The dish wasn't anything special, as it just tasted fried, but I couldn't tell that I was eating oyster because it was so deep fried and it was almost like eating the skin of a deep fried chicken, with a bit of a seafood aftertaste. My next dish was their chicken. The chicken was quite good and the mashed potatoes on the side were very delicious. It was pretty good, but again, nothing memorable. I had dessert too, the Apple pie, or more like Tart Tatin. That was good. This place was good, but not great. I will probably not come back here for a while because there's too many other French restaurants I have to eat at and this place didn't produce too memorable of a dining experience for me. But maybe someday I'll be back...",1

(and which reminded me of being in paris) we had a reservation for 7.30 on a saturday evening and it was completely full. i would definitely advise making a reservation rather than taking your chances on this tiny, exquisite place! we can't wait to go back. bon appetit!",1

For my entree, I had the pan roasted chicken, and everything on the plate was perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious. For dessert, I had the lightest creme brÃ»lÃ©e that I have ever eaten in my entire life. The service was absolutely outstanding - I couldn't have asked for better. They were quick, attentive and very knowledgeable. More than willing to answer any questions. The woman who was there (I should have gotten her name) was so sweet and a wonderful hostess. I will be going back!",1
1889,4,3,2/1/2012,"For a meal as competitive as brunch in NYC, I was hoping for better from Le Parisian. The tables are very close together- they actually needed to pull out the entire table for my (skinny) friend to squeeze into her seat- and the restaurant itself is pretty teeny, making it a noisy dining experience. The meal itself was fine. The menu is typical brunch, and we both had smoked salmon eggs benedict. It was good, not memorable. For a french place, I was just expecting more character. Even in Murray Hill, there are other brunch options that I'd prefer.",1

I had super high expectations for my sandwich because I've them in France and they were the bomb.com! Sad to sad that I was disappointed w/ the huge glob of congealed gruyere on my sammie...everything just tasted so mediocre. My friends omelette looked pretty lackluster as well.

We ordered the escargot, the mussels, and only one entree, the duck, all to split. It was the perfect amount of food, and it was all absolutely delicious! The mussels were really great because we chose the Spanish version with tomatoes and Chorizo, which was a nice spin on the traditional white wine and garlic option (which they also offer). We would definitely come back to just get wine and mussels some time. So tasty. All in all, I would definitely recommend this place (but only for parties or 2 or 4, tops). Bon appetite!",1

1911,4,4,11/28/2011,"Blocks away from the madness and chaos of Penn Station lies a quaint French restaurant. Le Parisien keeps tradition with staples such as French onion soup, steak with fries and escargot. For less than fifty dollars (split two ways), I enjoyed a bottle of wine, an appetizer, an entree and a dessert. For a low key meal with extraordinary taste and ambiance, Le Parisien is it (skip the trendy Pastis in the MPD and come here). PS: Come back for the unlimited brunch for 12.95 on the weekend.",1
1912,4,4,11/25/2011,Love this place for brunch! Â Totally french but that's why everything there is so good.,1
1913,4,4,11/24/2011,"A little gem in the giant crappy irish bar that is Murray Hil. Â Small but cozy spot, low key, French cafe/bistro ambience. Â Solid moule-frites, decent wine selection, seems owned and operated by the owners.",1
1914,4,4,11/11/2011,"Le Parisien, mon amor! 10 years of French lessons have left me still woefully unprepared to profess my affections for you so clearly as I'd like to, so I will keep this short, sweet, and in English. Le Parisien is an adorable, cozy, affordable French bistro conveniently located in the heart of Murray Hill. I've been 3 times for brunch with 3 different sets of people and once for a solo dinner and have always had a great experience. The staff is friendly and accommodating and the food is classically delicious. If you come for the $12.95 brunch w/ 1 free drink, make sure you or somebody in your party orders the croque monsieur and that you get to taste it, because it is AMAZING. Plus: if you want a croque madame, they will add the egg at no additional charge! I also recommend the eggs florentine, because hollandaise, eggs, and spinach are apparently a match made in brunch food heaven. As for the drinks, both the mimosas and the sangria are tasty with good ratios of fruit juices to alcohol. Since the only time I came here for dinner it was by my lonesome, I can't comment on anything outside of the PEI mussels (which were perfect!) and the wine by the glass (standard $8 glass, good wine), but I can tell you I know enough from that and the brunch to plan on coming back for dinner soon. The best part of all is that I've never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for a table here, ever, and with the exception of the 1st time I came I've always just walked in. Not to say the restaurant is empty - they just seem to turn tables over pretty efficiently without having to rush anyone out the door. Give them a try and you won't be disappointed!",1
1915,4,5,11/6/2011,Im not particularly fond of Murray Hill.. but I'll make an exception for Le Parisien. I have been here for both brunch and dinner... not once have I been disappointed. The clams are to die for..and the wine is reasonably priced. Go!,1
1916,4,4,10/28/2011,"Who does not like shoe-string fries! ? Seriously! If I could eat these fries daily and not be bothered by the fact that I have now morphed in to a giant hippo- I could die happy. In a nut shell: Great lunch specials, awesome food, my only bone is... well Zagat gave it a ""b"" ! But then again - what does Zagat know!? I could crush Zagat if I wanted to... just sayin...",1
1917,4,4,10/28/2011,Cozy little French place that serves fantastic duck confit. Â Would love to come back here again to try their mussels and onion soup.,1
1918,4,3,10/20/2011,"So while I was waiting for our brunch table, I felt something fall from the ceiling onto my hand... and much to my surprise it was a cockroach / waterbug. Â  I jumped back and the bug fell to the floor, and then the manager skillfully kicked it out of the restaurant. Â As in, he literally busted out some soccer kick using the side of his shoe and hurled the bug intact into the sidewalk (guess it's better than killing the bug). Afterwards he sheepishly turned to us and said, ""You still want to eat here?"" Â If so I can seat you right now."" To be fair, I was standing in the doorway near air conditioner unit so I can't tell for sure if the bug came from inside our outside. Â I also did take the manager's offer and wound up eating a perfectly fine, 3.5-star brunch, which given my experience I hope no one will mind if I go ahead and round that down to a 3.",1
1919,4,4,10/18/2011,"I've eaten here twice over the last 2 weeks and really liked it both times. The restaurant is tiny but quaint and the staff is very knowledgeable. The first time I went there, we had dinner, and it was really exceptional. I got the crispy duck confit (would definitely recommend this) and we shared the carpaccio and escargot appetizers. Everyone finished their plates clean. Last weekend I tried it out for brunch, and it's really a great bargain- $12.95 for brunch and a drink of your choice (coffee, sangria, or mimosa). You can't really beat that in NY! My roommate got an omelette which was nothing special, but I got the fritatta which was pretty good. Great neighborhood spot!",1
1920,4,3,10/13/2011,"With high hopes, I entered the dimly lit and soothing interior willing Le Parisien to be my favorite French spot in the city. Â Oh, Le Parisien, you looked so like such a charming transplant from Paris. Â  1. Â Food: Quite average, and did not match the promise of the ambiance. Â We ordered the filet of sole and the duck confit. Â The filet of sole was on the side of dry and bland. Â The duck thigh was good, and the salad was refreshing and light. Â  2. Â Atmosphere: Walls decorated with photos and posters referencing Paris, dim soothing lighting, oozing coziness and neighborliness. Â Lots of prepsters. Â Also, quite loud. 3. Â Service: Lovely. Â Our waitress spoke with a satisfying French accent, and our glasses were kept quite full. Â Food arrived in a timely manner.",1
1921,4,5,10/10/2011,"I've probably eaten here ten times and I would classify it as a wonderful neighborhood French place, emphasis on neighborhood. It really has a cozy French feel that I didn't think was possible to conjure in the epicenter of Murray Hill. Essentially Le Parisien is the antithesis of the bustling, boisterous Artisanal located just a few blocks West. Almost everything on the menu is a winner from the beat salad, onion soup and pate as apps, to the steak frites, duck and mussels as entrees, all stay pretty true to classic French cuisine and all are done particularly well. The best part is that, although the food rivals Artisanal, the prices certainly do not. Â  Finally onto the service which again feels neighborhood""y"". Not bad by any means but more of a proactive experience. The host is the significant other of the chef / owner who worked or was trained at Jean Georges - don't know the whole backstory - but something like that. She is French and very nice but she is often spread a bit thin because she is the only server for all 30 seats. There are bus boys of course but I can't ever remember anyone else ever taking my order. Bottom line is that I would recommend Le Parisien for anyone who wants a great Bistro experience that really makes you feel like you've departed the alley-like feel of 33rd street and entered a little bistro right of the Champs.",1
1922,4,5,10/9/2011,"Some of the best food I've eaten. Popped in by chance with two friends from work. The Mussels are to die for, I'm going back just for those alone! But of course we didn't eat only those, the salmon, pork tenderloin not to mention the Profiteroles, yum. Atmosphere is just as lovely, intimate, friendly and laidback. Recommended in a heartbeat.",1
1923,4,5,9/29/2011,"I'm so glad that I chose this place to have my first time ever French dinner. No need to dress up. The ambiance is relaxing, comfortable. Food is just amazing! The mussels, the rainbow trout, the duck confit, the salmon, the steak, and the half chicken, we all love our food. Since the food was so highly above expectation, when it came to choose which kind of dessert to have, we simply went for all of them. And again, they were all spectacular! We were preparing to walk out with half empty stomach, but it turned out we needed to take a walk after dinner to help digest. One thing should be noticed, if you are going in a group (5 or more), make sure you call at least a day ahead. We called on the same day in the afternoon, and they didn't have table until 9. We waited but everything else just made it up. Not recommended to go with a large group since the place is relatively tiny. Last thing is the lady who seems like the owner speaks English with a beautiful French accent. And herself is nice and beautiful too.",1
1924,4,3,9/15/2011,"The brunch food is great- authentic, affordable. It's a pre fix menu of $12. I don't like that they won't let you order just scrambled eggs and won't take any custom orders as part of the menu. The place is also super small, with about 8-10 tables. The service was ok, but we often had to request refills. I would probably go again because I love a French brunch, but I've had better.",1
1925,4,4,9/14/2011,This was like a budget trip to Paris. Â Simple dining with great food. Â My wife had the Eggs Benedict Florentine and I had the Mussels with Frites and the Roasted beet salad. Â The mussels were some of the best that I have ever had. Â I think the Frites were the best. Â Classic and fantastic. If I lived near here I would be a regular.,1
1926,4,3,9/11/2011,"I had high hopes for this place based on the reviews on yelp. i took a friend of mine here for his birthday. the place is cute and ambiance overall is nice. service was really good. also, i didn't find this place too loud as others mentioned below. however, the most important part - the food itself was mediocre. wine selection was also not impressive. service was really good and staffs were really nice. i feel bad that it didn't turn out to be as great as i wanted it to be. i doubt i will go back to this place again. (there are too many good places in nyc to make me to go back to a mediocre place!)",1
1927,4,4,9/5/2011,Great little place with really good food. Â Love the mussels.,1
1928,4,3,9/5/2011,"Decent food, good service, but honestly the food was nothing exceptional. Mussels were a little fishy, duck confit tough and dry, potato puree so-so, mushrooms overcooked. They were out of chicken so they did allow us to substitute duck in the chicken dish, which was kind. Maybe that's why all the food was so blah. But seriously, who runs out of chicken?",1
1929,4,4,9/3/2011,"Very Lovely Place! Had the onion soup - was the best I had - Just perfect! The caracio and the steak tartar were very good. Nice ambiance, good service. a bit slow - which adds to the authenticity :)",1

1931,4,4,8/21/2011,"This is my go-to midtown brunch spot for smaller parties. Quaint, adorable, good food and doesn't break the bank. The brunches come with (or at least have the option of coming with) a mini salad & fries. I'm not really a salad girl but this was lightly dressed and pretty tasty, made me feel justified in eating fries at breakfast (and my dessert later). I love their fries! Simple goodness. Â  Goat cheese frittata: I can be picky with egg dishes but this was filled with yummy greens and creamy goat cheese! Delicious. I tasted a friend's spinach omelet (i normally don't love omelets) but it was pretty good because the eggs were light and not greasy. French toast: This is usually my breakfast item of choice so maybe I am extra selective, but I wasn't impressed. The apples on top were really good but the toast itself wasn't. A sangria or mimosa comes with the brunch I believe and you can order additional. Not the best drunken brunch spot but if you just want one or two drinks its great. I loved the sangria and the mimosa's seemed a little smaller, so I think its the better value as well. Â  After tax and tip, meals average about $16 a person, which is definitely reasonable. The portions are not tiny, but they are definitely more french than american influenced. I usually have to snack or eat again within a few hours of dining here, but Â I also eat more than most. It doesn't seem to get busy until 1ish so if you can get your group to get there by 1230 there's not usually any wait :) The place is tiny, I don't recommend coming with more than 4-6 people.",1
1932,4,4,8/19/2011,"Went here for lunch with a friend recently. Super casual french bistro by work = awesome. I wanted a glass of rose but was a good girl and got a diet coke instead. I had the croque monsieur which came with a salad and was delicious and a pretty substantial portion. My friend had the steak tartare that came with salad and fries. The fries were pretty yummy. We were in and out in under an hour but didn't feel rushed, definitely will come back here for lunch.",1
1933,4,4,8/19/2011,"Fantastique! Wonderfully quaint and delicious French restaurant in Murray Hill. Â It's very small so make reservations. The food is freshly made and yummy and they have a huge wine selection. I had the grilled salmon with yogurt mint couscous, the escargot, and too many glasses of bubbly. Loved it!",1
1934,4,4,8/16/2011,"We stumbled upon this restaurant on the way to the movies and were in the mood for mussels and escargot. The ambiance was similar to that of a cafe in Paris and the staff was French (parfait). The wine was paired perfectly, as per our waiters recommendation and the portions were just enough to fill us without discomfort. We didn't have time for dessert, but they looked delicious. I will have to try one next time.",1
1935,4,5,8/15/2011,"I love coming here for lunch. It is never crowded, which is surprising given its charming ambience and the high quality of the food. Â They serve one of the best omelettes in the city. Â I also appreciate the relaxed service -- the genteel server (who I believe is also the owner) is attentive but never rushes you along. Â I hope to continue dining here for years to come.",1
1936,4,2,8/14/2011,"The food was okay, the ambiance was kind of lame due to the fact that you are literally seated 8"" away from other customers and can hear their conversations clearly. They should really consider making this restaurant into a family style dining restaurant where everyone sits at a long picnic table, at least that way it would be more cozy! Make sure you don't order the Steak Tartare unless you know that it is a patty of raw meat with a raw egg on top. My friend ordered it and was surprised to say the least as the menu has little to no information on the dishes available. Wine was good, average price for the area. All in all, I could have gone to the Village and got a cozier environment and better food for the same price. Check out Casimir if you are in the mood for French Food!",1
1937,4,5,8/12/2011,"Five stars for authenticity. Â I've lived in Paris before, and this is exactly what Americans croon over when they visit that lovely city, a great meal at an affordable price, with a quality wine paring, all wrapped up in a French little bow. I'm amazed, Le Parisien is just like a restaurant you'd find down a back street in Paris. Â  I'm not sure what Â I had, but I assure you it was good and I will return.",1
1938,4,4,8/8/2011,"We had a great evening here. The waitress was extremely friendly and helpful, and the food was delicious. We would totally come here again.",1
1939,4,3,8/7/2011,"Review for Brunch only. For $12.95, this place is a good deal as it includes a drink plus an entree. Â The entrees aren't huge, but not small either. Â They are probably the ""right"" portion, but the Americans we are are used to larger portions. And you wonder why America is obese? Â Anyhow, the french toast is made with brioche which is my bread of choice, but it's just lightly dipped in egg. Â Thus nothing special. Â The benedict is ok too. Â Not great, but not bad. However, it's a cute place and it does remind me a little bit of places we went to in Paris, so for the atmosphere I'd come back.",1
1940,4,4,8/3/2011,"I found this place using yelp on my phone, which for some reason almost always guarantees a fail... Not this time. The food was very very good, the wine was amazingly priced, and the service was better than almost anything I've experienced in the city. Also the desert was amazing. Go here, you wont be disappointed.",1
1941,4,3,8/3/2011,"Came here for lunch with a friend yesterday. It is a cute little place & surprisingly empty at 1pm on a weekday. I had the croque monsier & my friend had the filet mignon carpaccio, both dishes were $12 if I remember correctly. The croque monsieur was very good - the bread was fluffy and buttery, the salad was a perfect side dish. My friend described his filet mignon carpaccio as sort of like roast beef...I felt bad b/c he basically got maybe 6 small, very thin slices of beef under some salad & larger shavings of cheese. Pretty presentation but not filling at all. I gave him 1/4 of my lunch to help hold him over at work. My croque monsieur was also pretty small & after the meal, I was still hungry. Bottom line...food tastes good but not mindblowing so as to justify the tiny portions. I'd skip this place for lunch, maybe brunch would be better.",1

I've never had to wait for one of their (15 maybe?) tables because it's a local treasure and has yet to be discovered by the annoying, fratty Murray Hill public (I live in Murray Hill, so I can make that judgment). Last thing I want is another Penelope 1 hour wait to happen! I love their brunch special: $10.95 for an entrÃ©e (I had eggs benedict), side garden salad (very good!) and fries/fruit. Comes with a mimosa or bloody mary! Yummmm....is all I can say. The French owner is the only server on staff usually, and he is amazing. I love this place. I cannot wait to try their dinner!",1
963,4,4,6/28/2011,"Stopped in here while trying to grab a bite near enough to the movie theatre but far enough from the fratty douchebags of Kips Bay ... Et voila! Decently priced wines by the glass, and from the way DP inhaled the steak frites, I kindof wish I'd ordered more than the onion soup (it was good, if a little too tangy from the red wine in my opinion). Service was a friendly French lady, the food came out pretty quickly and best of all they leave you alone until you ask for a bill. This gave us ample time to listen to the rude girl at the table next to us take an extremely long, personal phone call at the table in front of her friends. I too hope the baby is his, btw, and I hope Biff gets out of rehab soon. Okay, maybe this place is just *almost* far enough from the sorostitute throngs.",1

Otherwise I might have not turned down 33rd street and let La Parisien make lunch hour the best one that day. The adorable decor, the chill vibe, and delicious food served as testament to the longer life spans of the French. Yes, my lemon sole was basked in buttered deliciousness and my onion soup was smothered with savory cheese. But this little corner of stress free heaven added at least 7 years to my life.",1
1950,4,5,6/21/2011,"Simplicity, appropriate volume, reasonably priced wine & variety of pleasing menu in cozy atmosphere. FOOD - refreshing poached egg green salad w/ pine nuts, mussels w/ herbs + wine was cooked properly and served at right temperature in a crafty pot that the cover served as empty shell dish. Â The crunchy fries was mouth watering. ATMOSPHERE - simplicity, bare bone decor style of table setup is appealing. Hard for a Gunner to cheer for PSG, but we can overlook the fact. Â Dining in the restaurant gives you the feeling of being transported to a nostalgic French small town. Â Efficient service and hospitable. LOGISTICS - easy to get to at 3rd Ave & 33rd St in Murray Hill area. CREATIVITY - for future evaluation.",1

We ordered the bistrot steak frites and marinieres mussels. We watched the rain begin the fall and relaxed from our long day in the city. Seated near us were a French couple, conversing in French, and carrying on their trip to this nice restaurant in Murray Hill.",1
1953,4,4,6/16/2011,This place is charming. We ordered the steak frites which were very tasty. My friend ordered the roasted chicken which she loves. Had the beet salad for my appetizer.

Â Hell, he eats it all the time! Despite previous experience indicating that, in the vast majority of instances, I am right and he is wrong, I tried a few bites of the tartare. An hour later, he turned to me and acknowledged that the tartare was a poor call; riding the Uptown 6 during rush hour with queasy stomachs was our apt punishment. It's been well over twelve hours, and my belly is still unsettled. Â I'm really bummed because this place is right in my hood and the brunch looks amazing, but... I don't know if I'll be able to make myself go back. UPDATE: spent the next morning vomiting at work.

I would conclude by saying come here for brunch :)",1

It was alright, but the pastry was a little gooey. Overall, this dinner was a great experience and I'd love to return for another meal.",1
1959,4,4,5/29/2011,"I came here with my roommate and girlfriend for brunch yesterday afternoon. There aren't many tables in the restaurant, and with the windows open, it very much had the feel of a small Parisian cafe (or at least what I remember them to be like from visits long ago). The service was decent, although I would say that it was a bit slower than I have experienced elsewhere. I didn't mind it that much, given it's a slow holiday weekend, but I probably would've been less blase about it if I was in a rush. The food itself was simple and light, which I really enjoyed. I got the French toast, which was indeed fluffy and definitely on the lighter end of French toasts I've had in the past. You get loads of sugar sprinkled on top, with apple compote on top - a nice complement that isn't too strong and overwhelm the toast with syrup on it. I sampled the wild vegetable omelet my girlfriend had, which was much lighter than other omelets I've had - most likely due to no cheese. The vegetables were a wide variety, though, and the herbs added a dash of flavor that you usually don't get. We got a pot of mussels for the table to share; these were delicious (especially the broth in which they were cooked), but I did feel like they may have been steamed a little on the long side. For brunch, I was also sorely disappointed with the orange juice - every city I can recall serves fresh OJ on their brunch menu; Le Parisien serves up OJ that tastes like concentrated Minute Maid with ice in it. The beverage aside, the rest of the meal was very pleasant. $13 for brunch is a pretty decent deal, and they have a good selection of choices for the meal. I'm not sure if I'd come back frequently - there are an abundance of good places in the neighborhood - but it's a solid alternative to a place like Penelope's.",1

Â I was big fan of Cosette, which occupied the same space for years, and was a bit skeptical about this next incarnation but am happy to report that the pan, steak frite and escargot were all superb, as was the wine list.

1961,4,4,5/25/2011,". My husband surprised me with a romantic dinner at this sweet little resturant in Murray Hill. The ambiance is intimate but not as romantic as one would expect from a small French bistro. What they lacked in dim lighting and soft music they made up for in cuisine. My husband had the Salmon and it was cooked to perfection, while I had the mushroom pasta and it was rich and savory but not heavy. Perfect! We lingered over tiramisu and wine and the restaurant staff was pleasant and attentive but we did begin to feel pressure to hurry up and finish up as the restaurant started to fill up and people were waiting by the door. This is not a family friendly place but it is perfect for a double date or a pre theater dinner with your mate",1
1962,4,5,5/22/2011,"a small quaint french bistrot in the murray hill area, this place is a hidden gem. Â a short wait for a table for three, but there was enough kitsch in the space to keep one entertained. Â the lighting was dim, which adds romance to the space. Â  once seated, the service was a little slow, with who appears to be the owner waiting on all the tables in the room. she speaks with an adorable french accent. Â we ordered a bottle of french wine, a bordeaux, which turned out to be delicious. Â just the right amount of tannins and flavor for the night, to accompany our escargots and carpaccio to start. Â the escargot was beautifully buttery and garlicy, with its delicate texture. Â  the entrees we ordered were equally amazing. Â the pan roasted half chicken my friend ordered was moist and succulent, unlike how so many other dining establishments prepare and butcher the chicken breast. Â the calf liver my friend's husband ordered was rich and irony, but sweet and tender. Â and finally, the steak tartare i ordered was memorable and flavored perfectly. Â the mincing of the beef can also be described as perfect; not too ground, and not too chunky. Â it was accompanied by a deliciously fresh frisee salad, bread and a raw egg delightfully served within its shell. Â  i would definitely come back to this dining establishment when i return to this area of new york city. Â it appears that many others think this way, as the place filled later in the night with other french natives and friends as we casually relaxed in the atmosphere.",1
1963,4,4,5/16/2011,I was in the area and looking for a place for brunch and found this on Yelp. I am so glad I did. The price fixed lunch was delicious and was actually a pretty good deal for the money. It is a very small place and not good for a group but its very comfy and cozy. A great place to have a nice relaxing brunch.,1
1964,4,5,5/13/2011,"I don't give many 5 star recommendations but Le Parisien met my expectations fully. I found this cafe thanks to my fellow Yelpers by searching restaurants in Murray Hill and sorting by most stars. French food can be hit or miss but, to me and my wife, this is a hit. It's a small place between that seats about 30 people. The owner was our waiter and he's from Paris. Our dinners were authentic and perfectly prepared and the prices seemed reasonable. We came on a Monday night around 8:30 and had no trouble getting in but I'd suggest making a reservation on any other night.",1
1965,4,4,5/5/2011,"This has been our go-to French bistro for several years since they were dba Cosette. Â We adore the warmth of the restaurant and it's staff. Â A couple of weeks ago, hubby and I went with our son and his girl. Â Our son's gf and I shared an order of the mussels in white wine and garlic sauce, hubby had the escargots. Â GF and I DIED for the mussels and vowed never to share one order again. Â For entrees, I had the duck, girlie had the salmon, sonny had the lamb shanks and hubby, the steak frites. 10 across the board! Â Last Saturday night, we decided to walk over because I just had to have the mussels. I ordered them even before we sat down at ""our table."" Â Hubby had their perfect French Onion Soup which he gladly shared with me. Â He had to. Â I was foaming at the mouth for my mussels! Â His steak frites were, of course, excellent and my mussels were exactly how I dreamed they would be. It took a lot of self control not to put pot to lips for the last drops of the sauce. I could've easily killed another order of them. Â I AM a lady. Hah! Â They offer their mussels in several other ways. Â In the very near future (this weekend, mayhaps?), Â I will have what our enchanting hostess told me is their best seller - the Parisien. Â BTW, Â word has gone out on this little piece of heaven so I strongly advise making reservations. P.S. Â xoxoxoxo to the chef.",1
1966,4,4,5/1/2011,Great lil find in the heart of Murray Hill. Came here for lunch and ordered off their set menu which ranged from $12 to $20 per person (includes a drink and fries). Food was a good representation of French cuisine and their service was perfect. The restaurant is small (seats about 20-25 total) and the atmosphere was very cozy. I'm super glad we discovered this place since I was previously traveling as far as Soho to get my French food fix. Yay something closer to my hood!,1
1967,4,4,3/30/2011,"Very local, very small, but the ambiance was pretty good. Probably not a good idea to bring a lot of people (best if it's 4 or less). I ordered the mussels Espagnole, which came with French fries. Mussels were decent, but the broth it came in was spectacular. It seemed very simple, but so flavorful. Bits of chorizo floating in it, and the tomato broth had the right amount of acidity. The service was decent, it took us awhile to get seated, but the hostess was very nice and apologized for the wait. NOTE: we came with 6 people so for a small French bistro, it wasn't too bad. Only thing I was not a fan of was the bread. It was terribly stale and didn't have any good texture at all. Kind of strange to complain about the free bread that comes before the meal, but I was pretty hungry when I first came in, and the bread was terribly unsatisfying. Overall, it was a good time, and it wasn't terribly expensive. Ordering a couple bottles of wine was a good idea, especially because it didn't break the bank as much as a bottle of wine would at any other fine dining restaurant. I would definitely come here again, but maybe more for a small group or romantic date setting.",1
1968,4,4,3/28/2011,"Really nice surprise. Â Usually having only less than 20 reviews on Yelp could be well a bit questionable. Â But this place was quite cute and brunch was delicious and very cheap for New York standards. Â It was about $13 fixed price and comes included with a drink of your choice, mimosa, oj, sangria etc. Â I had poached eggs and salmon on toasted muffin, which was delicious. Â I think most elsewhere the same brunch of the same quality could've cost twice as much, so it's def really good value. Â Would def come back again in the future! Â I did skim their regular menu which also looks enticing/fairly priced with entrÃ©es in 20s. Service was average.",1
1969,4,3,3/23/2011,"Came here for dinner on a Tuesday night. Small, cozy restaurant. Nice ambience. Food was good, not great. We started with mussels - portions was huge! Then we got homemade papardelle in goat cheese fondue and steak frites. Steak frites was good. Papardelle was too rich... couldn't finish half of the plate. Service was ok, busboy was amazing! Bottom line - nice experience, but probably won't come back. If I want french food, I would definitely pick the Odeon over this place.",1
1970,4,4,3/22/2011,"After pouring through open table and yelp i managed to stumble onto Le Parisien. Â Armed with a reservation and some recommendations I took the dive and what a pleasant dip it was! In a city filled with inflated French bistros *cough cough cough* i'm looking at you ARTISINAL,BALTHAZAR, PASTIS - tucked away between Lex and Third lies this gem of a restaurant. Â  It was refreshing to find a cozy, neighborhood, french restaurant that served great food and didn't operate like a TGI F-rench bistro. Â I mean your typical bistro look was there - the large mirror, the bistro tables and chairs, the booths, hand written chalk specials/wines..but Le Parisien has this charm. Â maybe its the size of the restaurant? maybe it was the charming owner? Â the dim but not too dark intimate lighting plus candle lights? or perhaps I was just surprised to find what i did - but to me it has that...that...je ne sais quoi So let's start with the food, my gf being a bread-a-phile enjoyed her bread/butter even though she initially only wanted to wait for her meal. Â The food was fairly priced with mussels and fries under $20. Â An atlantic salmon dish with capers and some other thingys for a little over $20. Â A bottle of pinot grigio for $30. Â not cheap but definitely not expensive. Â all of it worth it! Â everything i ate was delicious. Â my friends from out of town who we had dinner with really enjoyed themselves as well. i would list what they got but it has already slipped my mind being a couple weeks in the past... one thing you yelpers didn't pull through for me on was this molten lava chocolate thing. Â boy was i disappointed they didn't have it. Â BUT they did serve a lovely apple tart with ice cream which was delicious. Â so good that it changed my lady's mind on whether she wanted dessert and that, if anything, is how you know its good! I really enjoyed le parisien and consider it one of the better places i have dined at in recent memory. Â cheers!",1
1971,4,4,3/20/2011,This was an incredible dinner. Â You can tell a great deal of love and attention goes into every aspect of your experience. Â I would recommend getting there early as it seems to get VERY crowded the later in the evening it is and the tables are a little tight.,1
1972,4,3,3/20/2011,"This review is for brunch only. The ambiance of this bistro is lovely and with the door closed, you can almost imagine being in Paris. It's a good sign when the French are a big part of the clientele. Sadly the food didn't live up to it's surroundings. My omelette and my bf's frittata were on the bland side, but the frites and salad were delish. Perhaps dinner here is the way to go.",1
1973,4,4,3/18/2011,"Visited Le Parisien for brunch recently - having learned about the favorable set pricing of just below $13 (as of this writing) which includes your entrÃ©e choice and a beverage - mimosa, sangria, orange juice or coffee; not at all bad by Manhattan standards. The bistro is small, intimate and charming with sort of a rustic feel. The ambiance is pretty characteristic of a typical Parisian eatery. In true Parisian fashion, the menu features a decent range of 'omelette's which I absolutely love. I decided to try the one stuffed with mushrooms and asiago cheese -- served with a side of mixed green salad and frites (fries). Very tasty. One small negative: my OJ arrived with cubes in it (a pet peeve). I know some folks take ice in just about every beverage but I see this as a faux pas in OJ. At least it would have been nice to have the choice. Overall: a simple, good, dining experience.",1
1974,4,4,3/10/2011,"My friend suggested this place to meet up, have a little wine and dinner. Â I like trying french places - often they can be like WOW A NEW FRENCH PLACE or...Blech what did i just eat? Â  First the place - it is really cute. Â Small - but cozy and dimly lit so it has a romantic feeling. Â You can see a panoramic view of the restaurant interior online, and you can get the feeling of how small it is. Â That's fine as long as the food is great - might suck if you have to wait for a table - so make reservations. Â I cannot stress this more. Â  Onto the food: Â We started with the Muscles with Chorizo and tomato Confit (a preserve made of tomato and chorizo then cooked in that juice) - that was amazing. Â They give a big bucket of muscles and when you are done - MAKE SURE YOU GET BREAD and soak up the sauce then eat that. Â I think if i did that - i wouldn't have needed an entree. Â The escargots my friend had. Â They were good. Â I'm not a connoisseur of escargot but as far as i'm concerned they were tasty. Entree! Â I had the Homemade Papardelle pasta with Wild Mushrooms in a goat cheese fondu. Â Simply put - broad noodle pasta with mushrooms in a goat cheese sauce. Â This was very good and very fresh. Â Pasta is something i rarely get excited for - but the actual noodles were excellent. Â Silky smooth and cooked perfectly. Â The wild mushroom/goat cheese fondu was ok. Â Creamy, but somewhat bland. With a bottle of wine later - nothing mattered hehe. Â Price was a little more than i wanted to spend for the night but for the food we got - it was perfect. Â Portions are deceptively large. Â While it looks like a small amount of food - its actually a lot. TL;DR - Cute and Small French Restaurant - excellent muscles, very good noodles (sauce was a little bland) prices were what i expected to pay for french food.",1
1975,4,5,3/3/2011,"We loved this cozy bistro. Of the many now found in NYC, this rings in authentic Parisienne ambiance. The food was excellent, owner & hostess quite friendly and the tarte tatin formidable.",1
1976,4,5,2/26/2011,Adorable little French restaurant only three blocks from home. Â The food was very good and the service was great. We absolutely closed the place and did not get rushed at any point in time. They have a brunch as well that we are looking forward to trying.,1
1977,4,5,2/20/2011,"found this place thanks to Yelp. Great place, would recommend booking before going though as it is a cosy place. The ambiance is great and cosy. It really made me feel like home. Owner is friendly and the food is really great. We had escargot (delicious), then duck and steak and for dessert creme brulee and gateau au chocolat (chocolate cake - more like chocolate lava). So good !! go there it is awesome. great service !!!!!",1
1978,4,4,2/18/2011,"Very good bistro fare. Â in a neighborhood that lacks good restaurants this is a gem. Â good table wine, great fish, roasted chicken and of course steak frites. Â  i think it is new but the food is great. Â good place for friends or a casual dinner.",1
1979,4,4,2/13/2011,"Solid food and a great price. While the menu is not extensive, the focus allows for better quality. The service was attentive (ie water was always topped off and you did not have to wait long to place an order or to get a check), but not intrusive (no pestering you about how everything was going). The place is smallish, so it can be tough for a large group. Overall a great place to grab brunch!",1
1980,4,5,1/29/2011,"This is a TOO DIE FOR French bistro in Murray Hill. We went 3 times on our last 5-day trip to New York. This place seats only 30 - it is sooooo much like a true French bistro. Don't miss the beet salad, steak tartare, escargot, Thai mussels with frites, the duck, the lamb and the bread pudding. Only disappointment was that the duck pate only shows up on select days. Wine is AFFORDABLE! And Anna, who runs the place, is so sweet, helpful and knowledgeable. I can't wait to go back!",1
1981,4,4,1/23/2011,"Love this place! Came for lunch, brunch and dinner. It's rare to find a spot in this price range that has perfectly dressed salads. The salads are not dripping with greasy dressings, but every leaves of vegetable has a coat of it, just perfect! All other entrees are nice, too. Nice wine selection at great price. Skip the desserts. For brunch, their french toast is YUM, get it for dessert instead of the Tart Tartine. Portions are not big like the other neighborhood joints, but most things are priced reasonably.",1
1982,4,4,1/18/2011,"My friend and I were very pleased to find this charming, intimate restaurant amidst Murray Hill's frat scene. We came here for dinner and our experience was very good. Regarding the service, our french waitress (or owner?) gave us enough time to peruse our menus, but didn't neglect us either. She was knowledgeable and pleasant. I agree with the previous reviewer regarding the grilled wild salmon entree...It's hard for most places to make this sort of dish anything other than bland. Here, the dish was savory and the salmon was tender. (Sometimes there is no substitute for butter!) My friend's entree was great as well, but we both found ourselves wishing we had ordered some pomme frites as we watched them make their way to another table. My Moroccan squid appetizer was very nice, but nothing remarkable. I wouldn't mind trying their onion soup next time. Regarding the wine, we liked their selection. My friend and I were not all that eager to split a botte of wine, so we split a carafe. A nice option to have. I looked forward to returning for some more taste tests.",1
1983,4,4,12/28/2010,Came here for brunch with 5 people and we were seated immediately. The advertised brunch deal seemed too good to be true but we were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. There are plenty of options and everything was flavorful. The mimosas were ok but I'd recommend the sangria. I would definitely come back here (often) for brunch.,1

1985,4,5,8/30/2010,"I was looking for a French restaurant near my apartment and I found this one. I have to say I wasn't expecting it to be great, but it was better than great, it was amazing. Growing up with a French father, I've grown to love French cuisine and I crave it every now and again. This place not only feels like it's stuck in the middle of Paris (due to the chalk board wine list and old French posters), but the owner is extremely nice too. Not to mention the food was absolutely delicious. I had the chilled tomato soup special to start. It wasn't gazpacho, but it had similar flavors and was delicious. Then I had the grilled salmon with lentil salad and bacon - delicious, I would get it again. My boyfriend had the escargot, which were cooked perfectly (not too chewy, not too crispy) and the steak frites which had a delicious peppercorn sauce. I plan to go again soon to try their brunch.....",1
1986,4,4,8/21/2010,"We were lured in with a sign posted outside that advertised a daily special with beets. The space is TINY, really giving it an authentic French feel to it! For our table, we even had to move it aside to sit on the inside seat, but Americans overrate space imo anyways :) The friendly and chatty lady next to us warned us not to get the escargots because they weren't garlicky enough, but she highly recommended the steak special. We didn't even end up getting the specials because the regular menu had so many good looking things. I started off with the endive, roasted bosc pear, roquefort, walnut relish, balsamic port vinaigrette salad which was plated in a beautiful fan pattern as perfect little morsels of flavor. The Parisien mussels with saffron and mustard cream was next. The sauce was a hair on the salty side, but the mussels themselves were well cooked and juicy. For main entree, I had the grilled wild salmon, warm spinach & lentil salad with bacon vinaigrette. These are all things that can taste quite bland, but it was shockingly flavorful! Those French really know how to work the spices. I had a bite of the pork tenderloin, bosc pears, brussels sprouts, bacon, and calvados sauce too, and it was similarly fabulous. Dessert: blood orange sorbet avec profiteroles. Rich, decadent, and yelling for a long walk to work off the pounds afterwards, but definitely worth it! Je suis devenue plus franÃ§aise aprÃ¨s avoir manger ici. Ce restaurant Ã©tait fabuleux :)",1
1987,4,4,7/30/2010,"New little French bistro in the neighborhood. Â It's a small, unpretentious place, not overdone, like something you might actually see in Paris. Â The menu is pretty standard; all your French bistro favorites are represented (onion soup, escargot, mussels, steak frites, etc.).

They brew good coffee and during the weekdays you can get sandwiches, soup, or salad (although I would opt for the soup they always have delicious flavors and variety) The only red flag I throw is the credit card minimum of $4.00...makes it tough to get coffee on the go if you don't have cash.",-1

1991,5,4,1/2/2015,"Great tasting coffee and pastries from my two favorite bakeries downtown, Balthazar and Cici-Cela, so what can go wrong? Their cold-drip coffee is awesome in the summer time. However, they are on the expensive side (hence 4 instead of 5 stars) so get their 'frequent buyer' card, and don't count on getting a place to sit as this place is tiny and cramped. I do get a kick out of following their daily pool going on with the tip buckets.",1

I haven't had a chance to try out any of their sandwiches or wraps but from what i've seen, they do look really tasty. The staff is really friendly and nice here too! It is a small shop here, so its not one of those coffee places you and just lounge around on your laptop all day but then again, if you are lucky enough to snag a seat... I guess i don't see why not!",1

While there I also tried 3 other coffee places in the area, but this was hands down the best. They make a terrific cappuccino which never requires sugar. Milk was steamed to perfection and the coffee not a bit bitter or over roasted. The baristas and cashiers were pleasant and efficient. On a side note - I got that special honey lavender latte that others may have mentioned but I found it overly sweet. Stick to the traditional stuff and you won't be disappointed.",1

The espresso drinks are fantastic. The milk is foamed just right and they do a wonderful soy latte as well. I often get their oatmeal, which is prepared without milk (great for those who are lactose intolerant), and to which you can add toppings like: walnuts, bananas, apples, and cinnamon. Their regular brew coffee is good, but not something I crave. The pastries are ok, but not exceptional.",1

However the actual coffee flavor is weak. I took the scone home and toasted and buttered it (because duh) and it was good albeit a leeeetllleee too hard for my taste. But I can't wait to go back and get another latte! Would like to try the regular caffeinated one and see if that makes a difference.",1
2006,5,3,8/20/2014,Service was not as attentive Pastries were good Coffee was really good. The honey lavender latte was also really good. the lavender was not over powering and it was not super sweet either.,1
2007,5,5,8/14/2014,Best coffee in the Wall Street area. Especially the cold brew ice coffee! They use intelligentsia beans. Delicious! Way better than Starbucks on the other corner. Once you try really good coffee you can never go back. They even have a punch card so you get a free coffee after purchasing 10. I'm so glad they started to open on Saturdays. Now if only they were open on Sundays!,1
2008,5,4,7/26/2014,This is a really cute little cafe in fidi! There are so many coffee shops around the area it's so hard to find one that feels as coffee shops should--comfy and friendly in a way that makes me feel like staying all morning to chill with the baristas. The baked goods are from Balthazar bakery and the honey lavender latte is exquisite. I got it hot this morning but I'll probably go back to try the latte iced for the hot summer afternoon since it's so delicious.,1

2010,5,4,7/23/2014,"It's my first week at my new job in the Financial District and I have been eager to find and try all the hot spots for coffee and food. Let's just say, I wasn't expecting a food mecca in this area, but there are a few great places to check out. I don't drink too much coffee, maybe one cup a day, but when I do drink it, I want the good stuff. Meaning, I'm looking for a hipster/trendy shop where I am most likely going to shell out around $4 for a cold brew. Not a Starbucks or Dunkin, and especially not the crappy java from the work cafeteria. As I ventured out this morning looking for a caffeine boost, I opened up Yelp to see what was around. Unfortunately, my phone service is absolutely terrible around my office so I went for a short walk hoping to run into a decent place. Luckily, I ran into Blue Spoon (which is literally steps away from my office). Their outdoor sign enticed me as I read that they brew Intelligentsia coffee and offer breads and pastries from Balthazar and Ceci-Cela. I was immediately greeted with a smile at the counter and surprisingly there was no line. It's summer so I went for a cold brew ($4) and picked up a fresh piece of fruit, although I was extremely tempted to try the delicious looking pastries and bread from Balthazar and Ceci-Cela. I'm happy to have this place right around the corner from my office. I'm glad I ran into it when I did, otherwise I would be still walking all the way to Hudson Eats at Brookfield Place to grab a Stumptown cold brew from Black Seed.",1

Originally I had ordered a soy latte but then I saw that they had honey lavender lattes. Say what?! So eager to try it out, I ordered an iced honey lavender soy latte. Two words: fricken amazing. I could taste both the honey & the subtle hues of lavender. They were blended in well with that shot of espresso & soy milk. Oh hot damn! I have been converted. The end.",1

I like their half panini and soup combo, and their homemade chocolate chip cookies.",1

2013,5,5,5/16/2014,"I'm a fan of Intelligentsia coffee, so that alone earns this place three stars. The fourth is for good baristas that can make a creamy cup of latte using almond milk. It is however, on the pricey side.",1
2014,5,5,5/14/2014,"Been there a bunch of times so far, and it's very consistently awesome. Upping the stars, what a great find!!!!",1
2015,5,5,5/8/2014,A small coffee and almond croissant for $5.54 is pretty good considering how tasty both are. It's the first coffee that I can tolerate drinking black! Now that's amazing!,1
2016,5,5,5/1/2014,Awesome coffee shop. Tried the goat cheese panini and it was delicious. Bread was great and had the perfect crunch. Balsamic dressing and red onions were a nice touch. No stinky onion breath since they are pickled (it seemed). Worth a visit!,1
2017,5,5,4/29/2014,"I come to this place regularly about 3 times a week and it is consistently great...I never felt compelled to write a review (lazy) until recently I had a hazelnut latte with almond milk...it was probably the best drink I have ever had just absolutely delicious and creamy. The espresso and plain iced coffee here is perfect, smooth and rich. I love their intelligentsia brew of regular coffee. I know coffee-snobs don't believe in sweet flavored drinks, BUT I love how Blue Spoon realizes that is what the trend is, their flavored drinks are perfectly balanced. They use Monin syrups, which is the only kind of syrup I drink for flavored stuff. I love their flavor combinations, such as the Honey Lavender latte, raspberry mocha and all winter I was hooked on the peppermint mocha. Every drink is made with care and attention, and you can taste that in every sip. Love the pastries (Balthazars almond croissant!!) The workers have always been friendly and a pleasant part of my mornings. I like the location it is in a very cute area of FiDi and the inside dÃ©cor is modern yet elegant....All in all, a perfect way to start my busy mornings, and my favorite coffee place in FiDi.",1
2018,5,4,4/13/2014,"This is a tiny small cafe with sitting for about 8 people at max. The list of drink ranges from regular coffee to fancy crafted drinks. Price is reasonably same. The major difference is the cup they use. If you want to drink your stuff in those nice espresso cup sometimes, come here and ask to stay.",1
2019,5,5,4/10/2014,"I'll tell you all what I told who I presume to be two managers of this place (they're always there) this morning: I love this place. I usually make coffee at home, but when I don't have the time, or if I am craving an awesome bagel with my coffee, I come here on my way to the office. The drip coffee is outstanding -- Intelligentsia -- and the bagels, pastries, and muffins are very good. I don't drink lattes and such, but they seem to be made with the utmost care. The employees nearly always have smiles on their faces, and their enthusiasm for serving top-notch coffee and morning vittles is infectious. The soundtrack is usually really good, low-key indie rock, which suits me just fine. If you go to the Starbucks across the street, you are either A) a fool; B) extremely lazy; or C) don't know what good coffee is. A little slice of soul in an otherwise soulless area of New York.",1
2020,5,5,3/30/2014,Delicious chai latte and oatmeal. Nice place to grab a quick breakfast and eat at the window-side counter alone or with a friend. The pastries look delicious as well. Good neighborhood spot.,1
2021,5,4,3/20/2014,"I must say i'm not a fan of intelligentsia coffee, it's too light and acidic for me, but this place does have the best I have had. I have been wanting to come here for a while and i finally made it. The space is tiny and I probably should have got a treat but didn't. This place is a great alternative to starbucks.",1
2022,5,5,2/1/2014,"Coming from someone who lives in the neighborhood and has conducted a good deal of research on coffee places in FiDi, trust me when I say that this place is worth your time and money. If you find yourself veering toward Starbucks across the street, STOP! Slap yourself on the wrist, turn around, and go to Blue Spoon. Their prices are pretty standard for coffee in the city, but you get a waaaaaay better product than any of the giant chains and they have some pretty decent little snacks too. I've yet to try any of their sando's/ bigger plates, so I'll write a follow-up review for that. Otherwise: great product (latte- two thumbs up), tasty pastries, cute & simple decor, and friendly service. The only downside is that the place is a little too small (line can easily build-up out the door). Final vote: top 3 coffee places in FiDi.",1
2023,5,4,1/30/2014,"I wrote a review of the Chambers Street location back in November, finding it to be a depressing hole in the wall where happiness goes to die. Well, those weren't my exact words, but that's the impression I got as a customer. I'm THRILLED to say that the William Street location is a vastly different experience--bright, cheerful and staffed by workers who don't look like they're currently getting zapped by shock collars. As before I went with the house blend, served up by a personable guy at the counter. I even witnessed him troubleshooting an issue with a customer--the chili supply had run dry--and it appeared to be a very positive affair. My lunch was the Goat Cheese Panini, and I completely enjoyed it. Creamy goat cheese, tart roasted red peppers and a crisp panini bread with just a hint of balsamic was a winner. My only gripe is that, unless you're ordering just coffee, there isn't any place to stand and wait. Â I crammed myself by the sugar and milk station, hanging by the red phone on the counter (so THAT'S what happened to the hotline to the Kremlin after the end of the Cold War!). But, hey, this is Manhattan and space is at a premium anyway. In my visit to the Chambers Street hovel, they said that the owner loved the William Street location and gave that more attention. It was obvious that the latter locale is a better place, and worth the four-star review.",1
2024,5,5,1/21/2014,"Love this place. Service is wonderful, sandwiches are some of the best and the coffee what can I say...the best coffee anywhere. Wish they had a location in Miami Â I would never look at Sbux again",1
2025,5,4,12/17/2013,"Stumbled upon this place near my dorm room! I recommend the white chocolate mocha, it was to die for! I also got an oatmeal with brown sugar and walnuts which was also really delicious! The customer service was great, they were super friendly and I will definitely come back! Best oatmeal in FiDi!",1
2026,5,4,12/6/2013,"This shop is cuter than the location on Chambers, but just as small. I think the baristas are kinda rude, but they make a mean mocha. Â As for other bites, their baked goods are fine...and they even offer hot (not instant) oatmeal in the mornings.",1
2027,5,5,11/22/2013,"Love this place! It makes me want to take the C train even though it's a further walk to work just so I can stop here and get that delicious Intelligentsia coffee and Balthazar almond croissant, from the attractive and charming young hipsters. There are tons of coffee options in the area, but this one definitely stands out and seems the most out of place for the financial district. And the coffee absolutely makes my morning.",1
2028,5,5,11/14/2013,"This is a great Coffee Shop. For so many reasons. Ready, Set, Go: 1. Top notch bagels and pastries 2. Hilarious Staff 3. A super awesome ""This is a Window"" sign so you don't smack your face into a glass wall 4. Rewards Program 5. It's not a big box place, you see where your money goes 6. It's called Blue Spoon 7. Quick 8. Close to a ton of offices and subway stations 9. Need to get to 10 10. The prices aren't out of this world If you need a place to go for a quick bite for breakfast, a snack, or even lunch - Blue Spoon should be your go to. It has that hipster ""I'm buying coffee but I'm revolting from society by avoiding starbucks"" vibe which I dig.",1
2029,5,5,11/8/2013,Best coffee nd scones!!,1
2030,5,4,11/3/2013,"A small place, but a pretty neat cafe for tea - and coffee. I came for the tea and stopped by per recommendation from a friend and it was a good experience. The guy behind the counter had a small theatrical performance with flipping the cup back and such, which was interesting. Loved the tea, which was very good.",1
2031,5,5,10/25/2013,"Thank god there's a cafe that serves Intelligentsia in the Financial District! Love this little cafe, the staff is always incredibly friendly (especially Tim, he's the best), the coffee is hands down the best in the area if not in all of Manhattan, the pastries are good, the oatmeal is fantastic, I even got a panini and fresh orange juice for lunch the other day and enjoyed that too. In short, I've never ordered anything from here I didn't like.",1
2032,5,4,10/1/2013,"Love love love this place. I am there everyday, literally. A small place full of regulars and curious newbies where the staff is pleasant as a warm autumn day. Ah, bliss. From a creamy warm latte to the gooey goodness of crisp panini and bagels, this place is my go-to for all meals in the FiDi. And the best part - they're darn good about customizations! Go once, and you'll go again. Promise.",1
2033,5,4,9/18/2013,"Excellent coffee, served piping hot and fresh. Haven't tried any of the food items yet. Cute place too. Though it's small and with limited seating, suitable to sit and do some people-watching if you are so inclined. My only complaint: they should open on Sundays for the local residents like me who can use a good cup of coffee on Sundays just as much as any other day of the week!",1
2034,5,1,9/9/2013,"BLUE SPOON SUPPORT PRICE GOUGING I love intelligentsia coffee, but I am not a believer of charging $2 extra for adding milk in a larger cup. They refused to charge me for an iced espresso when I asked for them to put it into a larger cup (vs. the miniature cup used for just espresso shots) so i can add a little milk to it myself. They told me ""That is an iced latte"". Even Financier lets me do this. I give them a year.",1
2035,5,4,8/13/2013,"Only tried their coffee. Decent cup, but it was $2 for a small coffee. Place gets packed during lunch time. And there's only a narrow space with 3 tiny tables & a couple stools by the window. So be willing to stand in a cramped space while ordering & waiting for your order.",1
2036,5,4,8/12/2013,"Intelligentsia coffee. Quick service. Docked a star because the lox on the bagel wasn't very fresh, but the bagel itself was perfection. Would come back, just don't get the lox bagel.",1
2037,5,5,8/7/2013,Support local business! Â Great coffee!,1
2038,5,4,8/5/2013,Really really tastey drip coffee and bagels -- I dont get anything else here so there's not much more to say.. Counter service is friendly and quick. Price is A-OK. Wish it was comfier to sit and sip but for a small place in a crowded area that's pretty understandable,1
2039,5,5,7/28/2013,OK I am a huge fan. Â I love Intelligentsia coffee and they serve it here. Â Large was hot and flavorful but not bitter and for $3 a good deal. Â Balthazar pastries an added bonus. Â People are nice and its not Starbucks crowded. Â Frequent purchase card works for me. Â Quiet location and I'm going to be a regular.,1
2040,5,4,7/25/2013,"Awesome almond croissant. Also good chocolate and plain, too.",1
2041,5,2,6/28/2013,"Terrible coffee made from great beans. This has all of the signatures of a great coffee shop. Intelligentsia, La Marzocco machine, pour overs, cold brew. Unfortunately it fails on all fronts. The pourouver was served almost cold and the cortado was bitter and served with tepid tap water in a warm gibraltar. Still have to walk all the way to Kaffe 1668 for a decent cup of coffee. The financial district doesn't seem important enough to open anything good. Stay clear of this place",1
2042,5,5,6/14/2013,"Grabbed a cortado and a mozarella panini. The panini was bomb - great bread (Balthazar bakery), fresh basil, loaded with tons of cheese! Cortado was great! If I'm paying four bucks for coffee, I better get some foam art and Blue Spoon delivers!",1
2043,5,5,6/11/2013,"If you are serious about your espresso based drinks then this is the best place downtown, it's really one of three good places . They brew intelligentsia, make good coffee, the people are friendly and they play good music. It feels like it belongs in a cooler part of the city and so it is something of an oasis in the financial district. Highly recommended for proper coffee (not giant corporate brands)",1
2044,5,5,6/4/2013,It always confuses me when coffee shops try to bake their own goods for the sake of saying they're homemade. I say let the experts do their thing and focus on the coffee! Such is the case at Blue Spoon Cafe. They have croissants from Ceci Cela (voted NYC's best croissant) and other baked goods from Balthazar. The coffee is wonderful - I had a cortado and the friendly barista put a heart design in it. Get the coffee card - 10 drinks gets you a free one.,1
2045,5,4,5/20/2013,"It's about a 15 minute walk from my office to Blue Spoon but I'll make it about once a week because their iced lattes are so damn delicious. My co-worker got me hooked on their sandwiches - my go to is now a fresh basil, mozzarella and tomato panini with chipotle mayo. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable!",1
2046,5,4,5/15/2013,"With so many lunch options around my office, I tend to be overwhelmed by the choices rather than adventurous and find myself gravitating towards the same soup-and-salad joints. Blue Spoon could be grouped into this category, but this little cafe is certainly one of the best ones in the area. I went to the William St location after it was recommended to me by a coworker, and I am glad that I did. They have a wide selection of coffees and teas, and since the skies started dumping buckets of water down when I was about a block away, a hot drink was just what I needed. I had the Moroccan mint tea and it was just fantastic. It was hard to choose from all of the tasty lunch options on the menu but the pleasant guy behind the counter made some helpful suggestions and was patient while I stood around trying to decide. I got the goat cheese panini and was incredibly pleased with my decision. The bread was toasty and crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The balsamic vinegar was perfectly proportioned over the cheese, roasted peppers, and basil (rather than drenched in it like I've found at many other restaurants) so the bread didn't get soggy. The atmosphere of Blue Spoon added to my reasons to return. It's corner location and walls of windows provide the perfect venue to people watch. It's also quiet and cozy, and since the the sidewalks were pretty empty during the downpour I appreciated the peaceful surroundings to hang out and read for a bit while I waited for the rain to let up. It was the perfect place to grab a quick bite, but I have a feeling the staff wouldn't mind if you stayed a bit longer. Now that the weather's warming up again I think I'll return and try one of their iced drink options.",1
2047,5,4,4/9/2013,"Their chai latte tasted a little weird (coworkers agreed) but the Intelligentsia coffee is spot on. They have some great sweet snacks (apparently from Balthazar, oooh). The staff manages to be both friendly and competent. It's a small spot, so get yours to go and be glad you escaped the line for Financier and the neverending wait for your incorrectly made drink with a hilariously inaccurate name on it at Starbucks. I predict a lot of cold brew iced coffees from here in my future. $5 credit card minimum!",1
2048,5,5,3/16/2013,Intelligenstia Coffee is served here. Hands down best coffee in the area. Not too much in the way of seating except counter tops and 1 or 2 tables though.,1
2049,5,5,3/14/2013,"Excellent coffee, rapid service, minimal time between ordering, paying, and sipping your well-made Intelligentsia espresso/cortado/cappuccino. I'm definitely a fan of this place!",1
2050,5,4,3/13/2013,"This place survived Sandy, so that is a big win already. Pleasant and calm cafe in FiDi. Smallish space with a couple tables and bar seating. $2 for a regular small coffee. They also have sandwiches and paninis, etc. Apparently, they serve Balthazar pastries, but that has no significance for me. Â  I would go back.",1
2051,5,5,3/8/2013,"Two words: almond milk. Two more: balthazar pastries. And then there's the cookie dough and the freshly baked goodness that gives this shop an amazing aromatic cloud every morning. Seeing as how I have frequented Blue Spoon nearly every weekday (it's closed weekends) since its opening about a year ago, I can say with some certainty that I am an expert on its offerings. The staff is super cool and always has my drink started before the words come out of my mouth (maybe I'm predictable. maybe I know what I like.). The almond milk cappuccinos are great - heavy on the espresso / light on the milk - albeit a bit pricy ($4.50) for the size. Glad they have a frequent buyer punch card! Much like the drinks, the place is super small. If you're looking for a place to camp out for awhile, this is not the place. If you're looking for quality coffee and goodies in FiDi, then look no further than Blue Spoon.",1

2055,5,4,1/4/2013,Nice joint. Â The organic full leaf tea is wonderful. Â I enjoyed the espresso and baked goods as well. Â (even though I shouldn't eat them!) Â I wouldn't mind if the chaps at the store smiled a little more but it could just be the hipster mentality. Â Either way they are pretty nice and the tea/coffee is better than the Starbucks next door (I do like Starbucks every once in a while).,1
2056,5,5,1/3/2013,"I've been going to Blue Spoon since the first shop opened on Chambers...I had been looking for good soup in the Financial District or City Center for months, with no luck. Â Every place served bland watered down junk or saltwater with food coloring. This place has the goods. Amazing soups, hearty and tasty. The vibe is also very nice, cozy and friendly. Go.",1
2057,5,4,12/7/2012,"Great alternative to the Financier cafes that dominate nearby. Â It's small and cozy, but still good for conversation. Â Friendly service.",1
2058,5,5,12/4/2012,"Finally, a quality alternative to the ubiquitous Financier and Starbucks stores. Â Delicious coffee (strong but not bitter) and Balthazar pastries. Â The last time I got a red eye at Starbucks at 23rd & Park the brain dead barista poured the drip coffee and let it sit behind a line of frou-frou coffees to cool off before adding a bitter shot of espresso 10min later. Â I ended up with a lukewarm coffee distinguishable as a red eye only by the increased bitterness of the Starbucks swill. Â Fast forward to Blue Spoon: Â the guy working the espresso machine takes his time, adds a fresh shot of espresso to a hot cup of coffee and calls your name. Â You can see the rich crema of the shot floating on top with all of its oily goodness. Â Wow, this is what a red eye is supposed to look and taste like. Â Don't stop at breakfast though, the panini sandwiches and house made soups for lunch are terrific. Â I'm torn about talking this place up - I want it to survive but I don't want it overrun either. Â I'm deciding I'd rather have this place thrive than shut down so skip the Starbucks across the street and try Blue Spoon. Â Much better product and faster service - it's a no brainer.",1
1285,5,5,11/9/2012,"Pretty tiny shop with excellent goods. Â Good coffee and Ceci-Cela chocolate croissants and Balthazar almond croissant... No need to go to Soho anymore. Â  Also the best toasted/buttered bagel I have ever come close to having downtown. This place is a huge plus for the FiDi area. Â Only problem - it is right next door so I will probably gain 10 pounds from the place. Friendly staff, not a long wait... Take a visit here.. You won't be disappointed. Â  There are a lot less of us working downtown here now Â - those of us left need to support the downtown businesses!",1
2059,5,2,11/8/2012,"Na, sorry that I have to give this place only 2 stars,...

I sympathize my friends... but the good news from William St is that Blue Spoon is now serving up well-made Intelligentsia espresso drinks. Sandwiches here are also pretty good, although I'm mainly excited about the coffee. I don't love the physical space, and have a couple other minor quibbles, but am rounding up here, given the lack of other options in the area - this is a great addition to the nabe.",1
2061,5,5,10/11/2012,Now I've had their bagels and cream cheese. Not as large as other straight up bagel places but still delicious. I got a bagel toasted with cream cheese and a medium coffee this morning for $4.95. Yum. Â I've had their roast beef sandwich for lunch as well - lots of beef and cheese and lots fresh veggies. Great place for great coffee and great food - wish it was closer to my office.,1
2062,5,4,9/21/2012,"Excellent coffeeshop to have in the area. It's one of the few, if ANY, pleasant and calm cafes in the Financial District where you can sit down with a book or some work and feel a little bit of your soul reemerging before you crawl back to your padded cubicle to run pivot tables. It's a small space. There are only two cafe tables and a bit of bar seating. $2 for a regular coffee, sandwiches and paninis are all around $8, and they serve Balthazar pastries. Â  And I know this is all #firstworldproblems and #stuffwhitepeoplelike but the Intelligentsia coffee IS great.",1

Thank you to this place for finally freeing me from the oppressive, disgusting, industrial coffee of the chain across the street when I go away from the desk for coffee (and from the equally gross K-Cup machine in my office...). In my heart, having lived out in PDX for a bit, I'm always a little weirdly slighted when a place chooses to serve Intelligentsia over Stumptown, but you know what? It's still awesome coffee, and it's SO much better than the other options around here. The pastries are all awesome, and I highly suggest going for the everything bagel with tomato and cream cheese in the morning (toasted, of course). Oh, and their tip jars are awesome/brilliant.",1
2064,5,5,8/21/2012,"Illy coffee (served at four Financier and two Manon outposts) is no longer the only decent coffee brand name in Fidi, as Intelligentsia has arrived on the scene via the nicely appointed Blue Spoon. The prices here for smooth, strong, high quality Intelligentsia coffee and tea are also lower than at many competing shops, including those offering inferior product. Â Neatly arrayed fresh pastries from Balthazar and Ceci-Cela are enticing in their display case, and gourmet lunch items are Â also available. All sandwiches are served on crusty Balthazar Ciabatta bread, and the roasted turkey sandwich with mixed greens and plum tomato was very fresh and generous in size for the price. Service is very efficient--there is none of the line out the door business from the Cedar Street Financier or tomfoolery among baristas at other chains.",1
2065,5,4,8/14/2012,"Finally, somewhere besides Starbucks, DD, and Financier for coffee near work. PROS: They have 2 counters, so their lines move quickly. They serve Intelligentsia coffee, Balthazar pastries, and H&H bagels. CONS: Going from the counter to the milk/sugar station, holding a cup of hot coffee without a cup lid or sleeve is a disaster waiting to happen.",1
2066,5,5,8/7/2012,"Just as great as their first location on Chambers Street! Â I had a killer shot of espresso today that reminded me why I like espresso so much. Â  Friendly staff, yummy food, great coffee and indoor seating - what more could you ask for?",1
2067,5,5,8/1/2012,"YES also so glad they opened in FID!!! Â I used to work around the corner from the Chambers location and then we moved south and Blue Spoon followed me! Can't say enough good things about this place, everything on the menu is good and I've ordered just about everything. Â I usually go for a for a half sandwich and soup combo. Â They use really good bread, everything tastes fresh and doesn't have a strange preservative aftertaste like most other soup/sandwich shops in NYC. Â  Soups rotate, ask for the chicken and rice soup, so good and sometimes not on the menu ; ). Â  The owner is incredibly nice and down to earth and at her business. Â Same great friendly employees have been there for years, says a lot about a business if you ask me. I don't drink coffee, but everyone I bring there says it rocks.",1
2068,5,5,8/1/2012,"They brew intelligentsia coffee....enough said. Great location a few minutes walk from my work. Great prices on Balthazar Bakery pastries. Panini are actually grilled until melted unlike many places around. Employees at both locations have been great. Coffee is one of the best around, this coming from a drip coffee snob with a french press and a pour over in my office for my coffee. They also sell their custom blend of intelligentsia which is great and no shipping charges like when I usually order beans from intelligentsia. Tip there is only one door. Over by the condiment bar, its a window not a door FYI",1

Perhaps I hope that they have 12oz cappuccino instead of 8oz.. I ordered cappuccino and an almond croissant.. TRUST ME.. Once you have cappuccino at Blue Spoon.. none of the coffee shop in FiDI can beats them.. YES... and they even have art in their coffee... YEAH!!! Oh no..

Friendly baristas who know their drinks and make the effort to create a genuine coffee-shop atmosphere (incl. free Wi-Fi). Now that Blue Spoon has joined the coffee lineup in FiDi, among the overbrewed Financiers and overpriced Starbucks, this is a clear win for the neighborhood. Early-bird prediction: In less than one month, this place will have lines out the door everyday from 8am to 10am and then again at 2pm for those who suffer from lunch comas. You've been warned, office drones and laptop-lugging members of Occupy, so get here ASAP.",1

Â It has seating, open windows and brand new everything. It was slightly less expense than a Starbucks and I really like the loyalty card, buy 10 drinks get 11th one free. However, I did not try any of the baked goods, they looked fresh. Â I think it's ashame the location is not open on weekends, it would probably get a fair amount of business due to the high traffic location of being in a residential spot. Â I'm sure since the other location has good reviews, this one will do well too. Â Hoping to stop by and try some other treats soon.",1
2072,6,1,7/21/2013,"I used to love this place when it was Xunta-a very authentic Spanish tapas bar, casual, informal bar with tapas and a great atmosphere - so I went for years, bringing many out of town visitors and friends for happy hour and on weekends. Now, sadly, I have to say that Nai is not the same place and not worth spending your money there. The new owner has made a lot of changes, for the worse, imo, and is very strange (looks like some dude from Queens)-he seems to be always there,with a scowl on his face, is neither inviting nor welcoming, and acts dismissive and like he is Â doing you a favor even talking to Â you-when we even show up early for reservations and have done nothing except wanting to patronize his bar! He runs the place like a formal dining restaurant..it feels like you have to be in exactly on time, spend your pricepoint, and get out-all very anti-tapas bar to me. At my Â birthday celebration of 10 people, he actually did ask us to leave after 2 hours because he ""needed"" the table though we had spent several hundred dollars and were still eating and drinking! I was flabbergasted at how rude that was. Â Also I noticed that since the change to Nai, the food is not as good as it used to be (octopus and other dishes not cooked well), with higher prices as well, and the sangria is now also watered down/sweet imo--just not a good value. And the dÃ©cor now is blah (think tacky flamenco paintings from homedecorators.com)-does not have any of the charm or personality of the old Xunta. Sadly, after giving it a go a couple of times, I am in search once again of an authentic Spanish tapas bar.",-1
2073,6,2,9/24/2012,Unremarkable - tried about 8 dishes expecting all to blow my socks off given the high reviews but was I mislead by the Yelp rating! Does not hold a candle next to Boqueria.,-1
2074,6,2,3/6/2012,Pros -Decent value -Friendly and kind service -Accommodates large groups Cons -Tons of loud groups -Not intimate at all,-1

2076,6,3,2/9/2012,"Came here on a date Saturday night. We had a reservation but since we were 10 minutes late (well, my DATE was ten minutes late...) we had to wait a while for a table. So they put us downstairs at the bar and it was packed. When I say packed, it was more crowded than any other restaurant I've been to in New York. Â We were 10 feet away from the bar in the room the size of my apartment (not big) with people eating their meals on all sides of us. I felt bad for them since my ass was right in their face. I don't understand why they try and accommodate so many people at once when there's no room. Anyway, after about half an hour we got a table. This was the table closest to the main entrance, and I would not recommend it. I think my chair got kicked at least 20 times throughout the night. I did enjoy the fact that they had live music and a cigar roller workin all night. I wanted to see if he could roll something else up for me after dinner since he had all the tools and looked damn good at it but felt like that might not be the best decision. The food was good, no complaints but I don't think I'll be back here on a Friday or Saturday night. Best to try on a slower night when it's not so packed.",-1
2077,6,4,10/27/2014,"the place has a nice vibe, the tapas are delicious and reasonably priced. i went there with a friend on a thursday night around 7:30 pm, right before the flamenco show. we had a great time looking at performance, the sangria is one of the best one i've had lately, and the service was friendly.",-1
2078,6,4,6/18/2014,"I came here with two other people for a book club meeting. It was happy hour, so we ordered a $10 half-pitcher of mango sangria, which was DELICIOUS. Also, almost all the food we ordered (tortilla, potatos w/ aioli, tropical salad) was flavorful and well-made. My friends ordered the chorizo with onions, which looked and smelled good, too (I didn't have any because I'm a vegetarian). The only exception was the asparagus tapas, which was actually pretty gross--I had to force myself to eat it because I hate wasting food. There were only two small pieces of asparagus, which were horribly overcooked and mushy (possible from a can), very cold, and drenched in mayonnaise. Our waiter was very friendly and engaging when we arrived, and did a cool long pour of the sangria, though he seemed to forget about us later on. But overall, this was a positive experience and I recommend this place.",-1
2079,6,4,5/30/2014,"We stumbled across this place, and it was a wonderful delight. The food was delicious and the service was great and very friendy. Wonderful choice of wine. Definitely recommend it if you get a chance!",-1
2080,6,4,9/3/2013,"The food dont only tast terrific, but is also put on the place in such a charming way. You eat with your eyes to and theese peope knows it! Staff is nice, serviceminded and easy to get their attention without feeling like you are ignored. Nice! I'll be back ofcourse!",-1
2081,6,4,6/18/2013,"I had my birthday dinner here with a group of 11. I made the original reservation for 8, and had a few extras show up. The staff accommodated my party with a larger table on a busy Friday night. The sangria was amazing, and the food was absolutely delicious. Everyone at the table raved. I'll definitely be back.",-1
2082,6,4,11/19/2012,"The manager here was really nice and was very accommodating when our party of 8 turned into a party of 10! We were there Thursday night, so the flamenco dancers were there and incredible!!!",-1

2085,6,4,1/23/2012,"Food was Really good, Service was on point (it was a bit early and quiet though) and the price was reasonable.",-1
2086,6,4,12/31/2010,"We have been there twice in three weeks; the first night it was a Tuesday early so there was hardly anyone there. Â But we were impressed with the quality of the food and the friendly staff. Â We returned two weeks later on the evening with the Flamenco dancing, got a seat right next to the dance floor. Â It was a great evening--the food was good, the mango sangria was very good. Â An uneven table caused a quite accidental drink spill and the waiter responded graciously with towels...and a free pitcher of sangria! Â We stayed for three hours, had four or five tapas, watched a first rate floor show...and got out for less than $100 for two. Â We will definitely be back many times.",-1
2087,6,5,6/25/2014,"Perfect Flamenco performance. Good food, but not enough. It's ok just order more, more more... Delicious Sangrias. This place is not good for a first date..., I guess it's obvious. The music is loud and there are too many distractions. Else, it is a perfect place to chill either solo or with a group of people.",-1
2088,6,5,4/14/2014,I really love this place! The service is excellent and the food and sangria is delicious! I've never had a bad experience coming here. It's small and cozy and it's a great atmosphere all around.,-1
2089,6,5,3/4/2014,"Service: Attentive, personable, accommodating Decor: Cool, enchanting, laid-back Food: Phenomenal, addictive, delicious In a word: Amazing! Anytime I wanted to ask for something, BOOM: there it was before I could finish turning my head! A napkin, more bread, water. Amazing! Both times I've been over the past few months the staff has been exceptional. We tried all different items the two times we've been (expect for the Pollo al Aljillo - WOW!!!) and almost everything was mouthwateringly delicious.",-1
2090,6,5,11/12/2013,The service here is AMAZING. Very attentive and friendly staff- this is very rare in a fairly priced restaurant. Their garlic shrimp is amazing- must devour all of the sauce!,-1
2091,6,5,10/23/2013,"Nai tapas is my local favorite, I have gone back at least 5 times in the past three months. Try to make it there for happy hour and get a pitcher or half pitcher of their sangria. It may not be strong but it's tasty and goes well with the 3-4 orders of tapas you shoul get there (or more depending on the group size). Tropical and mango are definitely my favorite nai tapas sangria flavors and highly recommend trying both especially if you like fruity flavors. Some menu favorites I always go back for: -Patatas Bravas -Croquetas de pollo -Mejillones Rias Baixas Also stop in for the amazing service :) the staff really makes an attempt to check on you and get to know you. I always love introducing new friends to this place for that and the amazing flamenco shows they have on Thursdays (I think they also have one over the weekend) but I've only seen the one on Thursday and it is truly a magnificent experience. You can't take pictures (it's distracting) which is a good thing because it's something worth experiencing through the naked eye.",-1
2092,6,5,12/1/2012,"Everything on the menu here is great. My favorite are the chipirones in their own ink, the bacalaos, the stuffed olives, the salteado de gambas, and pretty much everything I've tried! The entire staff is extremely friendly and eager to please. I also love that Â their food is always served HOT. The best part, though, is that it's a pretty cheap place to eat.",-1
2093,6,5,9/3/2012,"Late last year my wife and I were in the East Village looking for a Galician tapas and found Â Nai. It was a Saturday afternoon, in between meal times, and the place had few customers. We sat down at a high stool table, looked at the decently priced wine list (mostly Spanish and Argentine good wines), ordered some tempranillo, and we proceeded to tackle some pimientos de piquillo stuffed with cod (to die for), some grilled sardines (delicious), some exquisite cod croquettes and then, la piece de resistance, octopus Galician style (sauteed in olive oil and with pimentÃ³n/paprika: just like in Galicia). At Â $5 to $6 for a tapa or about $11 for a raciÃ³n (double the size of the tapa), food of this caliber is a steal when compared with trendier or faux-upscale similar establishments catering to Catalan or Basque tapas in the West Village. The best way to appreciate Nai is to sit in your high table, have a bottle, let the tapas flow, and see and absorb the young atmosphere. And so we found ourselves returning to Nai several times. Last night, we visited again for the pimientos de piquillo stuffed with cod; croquettes of goat cheese wrapped in jamÃ³n serrano (delicious); meatballs in brandy (quite tasty); grilled chorizos (just as it reads, which left us wanting next time for the chorizos in an onion sauce and chorizo in cider), and toppled with a desert of fresh lime-laced strawberries stuffed with custard (exquisite). It is heartening that we still have so many items in the menu to work through..... What brings us back to Nai? Â Is it the young and low-key atmosphere which seems so true to form to tapas places in university towns like Santiago de Compostela? Â Is it the warm and attentive treatment at the hands of David (the owner) or RaÃºl, the genial attendant from the Basque country? Â Is it the high quality Galician tapas that are thoroughly authentic, like back in Galicia, without contamination or ""adjustments"" to fit ""what the NY market would expect""? I don't know (but who's asking?) Â One think for sure: the way David and his co-owner chef constantly and solidly deliver the goodies, I don't think that I will have to worry for a while about high-priced debatable experiments involving chorizos toppled with mango and cilantro, just to appear hip. Nai delivers what is truly needed in NY: a real, authentic tapas place from Galicia, authentic to its roots in food and Â ambiance, all for very good value. Keep it up, guys! Well be baaaack!!",-1
2094,6,5,8/26/2012,"I've been to Nai a few times now and it always winds up being the perfect night out. First of all, the service is really top-notch. You're always greeted right away and the staff seems so efficient. The other night we enjoyed two small pitchers of sangria, the champagne and the mango. Both were excellent but the champagne is definitely my favorite. As for food, we shared six tapas. It was the perfect amount for two people. Prices were really reasonable as well. Can't wait to go back already.",-1
2095,6,5,8/21/2012,"been here last may and came back for a friends birthday. food is great, service is outstanding and the dancers are very good. ill keep coming ass long as they keep delivering, thanks nai tapas!",-1

2098,6,5,6/14/2012,"My group From Grapes to Glass did a wine crawl on Saturday afternoon in the East Village and Nai Tapas was our next to last stop. They were able to accommodate our large group and we took over the bar and tables in the window. Nai Tapas hands down is the best place in the city for tapas!! I have tried everything on the menu and it is all delicious!! I suggested that everyone try the sangria because it is insane and is always lip smacking good. They also offer an excellent selection of spanish wines, so everyone in the group had something new and delicious to try. I love the atmosphere and somehow they manage to be a great location for groups and dates. They have live flamenco dancing and the place gets super lively. So much fun. We ate and drank our lions share and all agreed that everyone would be back to Nai Tapas. Thanks to Nai Tapas!! Viva la Grape!!",-1
2099,6,5,12/12/2011,"This is an awesome restaurant for large parties! Â Raoul, the sweetly charming and attentive host, made my birthday truly festive and memorable. Â The champagne sangria, the asparagus, the croquettes and the octopus were delicious and reasonably priced. Â I would come back with my friends anytime I wanted a comfortable atmosphere, good drinks and a bill that does not ruin the evening. Â I made a reservation a couple of days in advance for 8 with no problem.",-1
2100,6,5,11/21/2011,"I have been here several times and have never been disappointed. From the great food and service, Nai does not disappoint. I recommend their mango sangria, which I have never had before until I tried it there, along with the octopus and ham croquettes. Their desserts are just as good, with the creme brulee ice cream or the almond tart.",-1
2101,6,5,7/20/2011,I decided to impress my new mother and father in-law by taking them to a nice dinner. I didn't have to think too much before I knew Nai Tapas would be the PERFECT place. I was DEFINITELY right! From the minute we walked in we were greeted and sat right away. We had a table right in front of the live Flamenco band which was a plus. We ordered a variety of tapas and each one out did the next. The tropical sangria was also very good and the entertainment was amazing! I know I scored some extra points with the in-laws by bringing them to Nai Tapas!,-1
2102,6,5,7/20/2011,"AMAZING! My bridal party took me to Nai Tapas for dinner for my bachelorette party and all of us had the BEST time! The food was DELICIOUS and the sangria was even better!! The flamenco show was the perfect touch and ALL staff was very attentive and polite. I definitely recommend Nai Tapas for a night out in the city if you are looking for fantastic food, great service, and live entertainment!!!!",-1
2103,6,5,6/15/2011,"Amazing place with amazing service. We had the best time enjoying tapas and the show. The tapas were delicious and the sangria was delicious but more like juice rather than an alcoholic drink. The show on saturday night was absolutely one of the best flamenco shows I've ever seen. The performances lasted a few hours, it was amazing to see the women dance full of passion and energy. We all had an amazing time and I can't wait to come back.",-1
2104,6,5,5/23/2011,"Simply the best in NYC!!! Go, eat, drink, enjoy.",-1
2105,6,5,5/22/2011,"An amazing find. I was looking for a restaurant to celebrate my birthday with a group of 12. I also wanted to find a spot that had a flamenco show on Saturdays. As soon as I came in to make reservations, I knew this place would be great. The decor is great; it's an intimate, low-lit place with exposed brick walls. Dinner was amazing. The best part was definitely the flamenco show. It is free, and lasts for hours. The dancers and singers were top notch!!! I felt like I was back in Madrid watching a show. The service was also amazing; with such a big group, our waiter was always available, smiled, and served us very quickly. The food was good, and there is a big variety of sangria. The prices for the tapas were also very reasonable. There is a flamenco show every Thursday & Saturday at 8:30. It is a must!",-1
2106,6,5,4/5/2011,"I was there on Saturday night with three friends and what a great place! Â We ate a total of eight tapas, had two pitchers of sangria and we each paid around twenty dollars with tip included. Â Great food, great service, low prices and an awesome flamenco show. Â We will definitely be back.",-1
2107,6,5,1/2/2011,"WOW - Double WOW. What a place to spend an evening eating and drinking. The Sangria's are 1st class, and the tapas cannot be beat anywhere in Manhattan, or the other boroughs. Great Flamenco on Thursday's and Saturday Great place and very freindly wait staff and bartender. This was my 2nd trip, and there will be many, many more",-1
2108,6,5,12/24/2010,A couple of friends and I ate there last night and it was terrific. Â Absolutely loved the food and the service was exceptional. Â What can I say even the prices were right. Â We can't wait to go back and see the Flamenco show.,-1
2109,6,3,1/7/2015,"Happy hour deals are hard to beat -- $3 beers, $4 house wine, $5 sangria (different flavors) and $20 pitchers! The food was OK, the gambas ajillo disappointing, but anchovy stuffed olives and croquettes jamon were delicious! Portions are good for trying alot of different tapas. Want to try the empanalillos and clams next time.",1
2110,6,2,1/2/2015,The food was absolutely delicious. I was with a group for a birthday and we ordered basically one of everything and each dish came out even better than the one before. The service was pretty good and was overall satisfied. My one issue is that two bottles of champagne were ordered and were never brought out. That wouldn't have been a problem if we weren't charged for them off the bill after the fact. We aired our grievance with the restaurant who were very apologetic and we were promised a mailed check - a month later and we still have not received the money.,1
2111,6,5,1/1/2015,Great sangria and atmosphere,1
2112,6,4,12/30/2014,"I went there on a Thursday night and had a great time enjoying the flamenco show. The tapas are quite good and so is the sangria. Its not the most authentic tapas I have ever had and the flamenco is not extraordinary. However, very good value for the price. Would definitely go back.",1
2113,6,3,12/25/2014,"No jamon iberico on the menu but they do have Estrella on tap. Â The potatoes with tomato sauce is a little on the spicy side, but still a great starter app.",1
2114,6,3,12/23/2014,"Ate here on Friday with my finance and have mixed feelings on the restaurant. Â The service was amazing. Â Our waiter was great - very friendly and happy to answer questions. Â They have a HH that ends around 7pm with good deals on sangria, wine, and beer. Â We tried the red wine sangria which I enjoyed. Â  The food wasn't great. Â We had the following: Garlic shrimp - probably our favorite dish Chicken Croquettes - very cheesy, almost with a velveeta-like texture. Â I didn't love these Chorizo (chistorra envuelta) - nothing great, but not terrible Fried goat cheese - It's served on bread with tomato. Â I wish the bread was toasted. Â The tomato and bread doesn't really add much Seafood crepe - this was just ok Meatballs - second to the garlic shrimp but one of the better dishes we had I can see how this would be good for groups, especially if you are taking advantage of the HH deal. Â If you're there with just one other person they sort of squish you in next to other couples/pairs. Â I also wish the restaurant was a little darker. Â The decorations are just ok but a darker room would have added a little bit of ambiance. Don't think I'd go back.",1
2115,6,5,12/20/2014,"Great place. Found it from reviews on Yelp. A great find. Food was a amazing. Everything came out fresh and hot. We tried a lot lol. We had the mango sangria very good flavor and fruit was nice. We tried the shrimp in garlic, yummmm. The cod dips, hamon croquetas, oxtail, tuna empanadas and the coconut crepe with seafood. All of these dishes were amazing. The atmosphere was perfect. A little loud but it was filled with people eating, drinking and having a great time. Great for a date, friends, family and maybe strangers. Lol. We talked with the people at the table next to us and had a great conversation about crazy things. Only in New York. They ordered alot of food for just 4 people but everything they had looked sooo good and prices are very reasonable. Â They have flaminco dancing Thurs and Sat nites. Servers were very nice and very attentitive. I live in Bklyn and will definitely come back and with friends. Go check it out.",1
2116,6,5,12/19/2014,"Went here to celebrate a friend's birthday and the tapas were pretty damn good! Â  Â I think we had 2 pitchers of san gria (which are the bomb) Â ordered a few Â tapas and the price wasn't bad. Tapas we ordered: Pelotillas De Queso De Cabra: Croquetas De Pollo Patatas Bravas Pintxo De Chistorra Con Huevo De Codorniz pulpo a la gallega There was also a steak with mango sauce (not sure if it was a tapas or plate), but we were sharing everything. Â  I like that we can have the small or large portion as well. Service was really good. Â  We did come here on a Tuesday evening so it was a low key crowd. Â  Â Would definitely come here again. I usually eat tapas in san francisco at places like lolinda, coqueta and cha cha cha. Â  I feel this is a more casual venue of these places but the food still is on par - I would even rate it better than cha cha cha.",1
2117,6,5,12/16/2014,"Friends and I were at Nai on Friday night. This restaurant has the perfect ambiance and amazing food. The four of us shared about 10 plates and it was more than enough food. My favorites were the shrimp in garlic and the fried feta cheese wrapped in ham. We also tried the meatballs, clams in spicy sauce, mussels, croquettes and patatas bravas. I would recommend all of these dishes! Hopefully we will be back to this restaurant next time we are in the city.",1
2118,6,4,12/15/2014,"My rating for this restaurant is based not solely on the food, but also for the live Flamenco music and dance performance. We came here with a fairly large group on a Saturday night (make reservations ahead of time for large parties, this is a very small place!). For parties larger than 10 people it is a pre-fix menu of $45 a person which includes 2 hours of unlimited drinks and a number of appetizers. For an authentic tapas place, the appetizers we had were sub par. Â I feel like they weren't for the serious ""foody"", but the Sangria was delicious. I cannot comment on their full regular menu, so I will have to come back and order a la carte. The Flamenco show was fantastic! The music is amazing and the dancing is beautiful, raw, authentic Flamenco. Being a dancer, this was a great experience all around. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Flamenco music or even for just a girls night out, date night or bringing your parents somewhere cool.",1
2119,6,5,12/14/2014,"This place is GREAT!!! My friends and I went for dinner, but ended up having a few apps because we were unable to make a decision. We had skirt steak, grilled shrimp in garlic sauce, octopus in virgin olive oil, fried goat cheese and braised ox tail = AMAZING, food was hot & fresh. As far as drinks we ordered a pitcher of Blueberry Pomegranate Sangria that was absolutely DELICIOUS * =] Service was AWESOME!!! Also, make sure you reserve a table; the place is a bit tight and does get crowded on the weekends so be prepared for a crowd and wait.",1
2120,6,5,12/2/2014,"We came here for a special occasion and absolutely loved it! I chose here because I wanted make sure everyone get to choose something of their liking and I am so glad I did. Our waiter was so nice to us! He was good with making recommendations based on our preferences and also making sure we were good with the portions we were getting. I had a reservation here and they originally put us in a small table next to the window but we requested to be moved to a more spacious area next to the bar. At some point during dinner, it felt more so like a dive bar because the TV was on. But it was good nonetheless. They gave us a lot of bread and good olive oil to go with it. The bacalao frito was not bad. My favorite was its grilled shrimp in garlic sauce. So good! I was convinced to try caracoles...and I was right to be skeptical. I didn't like it. The beef stew was the best though! Must try! I also tried the sangria and it was HH price. Â All in all, I had a blast! By the time we departed around 9pm, there was a line waiting outside. This place is good for couples or small groups. I highly recommend this place!",1
2121,6,4,11/29/2014,"This is a cute tapas bar! I came here Friday night for a 9:15pm reservation. (Heads up: we just came from the Regal Union Square movie theater and the distance wasn't too far, so if you're thinking of a dinner and a movie for a date -- you're welcome.) However, we arrived a little early - 9pm to be exact - and I guess because it was so busy in there, we had to wait those 15 minutes until our table was ready. My party of 5 didn't mind waiting, but it got a bit annoying because there was no place to wait except for the doorway and the waiters had to constantly say, ""Sorry, excuse me,"" each time they needed to go around us...yeah, it's a pretty small bar. Lesson learned: just be there exactly in time for your reservation. Here's what my table ordered: - Tortilla Espanola (potato omelette pie): sadly, really plain. Just literally an omelette with potato. Supposed to taste like: ""Oh my gosh, how have I not mixed eggs and potato into a pie before?"" But it tasted like: ""Oh, eggs and potato together. All right."" - Churrasco Arriero (skirt steak): My table ordered the tapas size (9 pieces). Let's just say after we ate finished it, we ordered the racion size (15 pieces). DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS ONE. The steak is so tender ... I'm just drooling about it now. - Albondiguillas Estofadas (meatballs): surprisingly delicious. It's like you never even see it coming! - Solomillo a la Naranja (pork tenderloin): also delicious! the sauce really makes it great. - Tabla de Jamon y Queso (charcuterie): as much as I love charcuterie, skip out on this one. There were 6 pieces of rolled up ham and 6 triangles of Machego cheese. This costs $15. It was a really depressing plate... - Seafood Paella: Depends on this one. If you're a sticky rice kind of person, this is the paella for you. If you don't, it's not. And I know, I sound ridiculous for saying this, but if there was meat in here, it would have made a huge difference. But there isn't so it's not the best paella, but for $17 it's pretty cheap. - Patatas Bravas (spicy potato cubes): very spicy, but very good! We also ordered the Mango and White pitchers of Sangria. Each pitcher was about $28 each. I mainly chose this place for the pitchers of sangria (clearly my priorities are in order) and both were great! Overall, I had a fun experience. The waiters were attentive and really nice. Oh! There's free bread with olive oil. And yes, my party was the one that kept asking for refills -- which the waiters gave with a smile on their faces! I am definitely coming here again (how did I miss those GAMBAS?!) since the prices were pretty decent for a tapas place (total bill for 5 people: $190 including tip - about $38 a person). Cailin's Recommendations: - Churrasco Arriero (skirt steak) - Albondiguillas Estofadas (meatballs)",1
2122,6,4,11/24/2014,"Went for sangria and tapas for a friend's birthday. Made a reservation for 6:30 PM on Thursday night. One of my friends got there on time while the rest of us were running late. She was able to be seated which was really nice - she didn't have to wait for the whole party to arrive. We ordered the pomegranate blueberry sangria which was tasted fruity and fresh. It was still happy hour so the entire pitcher cost $20. Then we proceeded to order six tapas (small plates) to split between three of us. The waiter was concerned it would not be enough food but we were entirely satisfied with our ordering. Standout dishes were the shrimp in garlic sauce (ahhh that sauce!), potatoes with the garlic aioli, and the fried goat cheese. We loved all the dishes though. Savory, comfort food. Each dish cost between $5-8, so 6 dishes was not overly expensive. Overall, a really great meal. We all left determined to go back another time. Highly recommended!",1
2123,6,4,11/22/2014,"I went to Nai two months ago with an old friend. It's a cute place tucked underground off of 1st Ave and 11th. Going off the server's recommendation, we did enjoy the Gambas al Ajillo; pretty much anytime you douse something in garlic sauce I'm gonna like it. The rest of the meal was enjoyable - I've had most of the dishes before, but I remember enjoying every one. We also showed up right at the tail end of happy hour - we ended up getting a discounted pitcher of sangria, and it was pretty good (I've never really had a sangria I've loved, but this was close). Prices were reasonable for the neighborhood. I'd recommend this place for folks looking for tapas in the area. Would be good with a very small group or on a date.",1
2124,6,4,11/20/2014,"Went here for my birthday recently and the food was amazing! We all shared dishes so I tried many- they were tasty and very good. The service was also awesome, really enjoyable experience! When I went it wasn't too crowded, but I can see it getting packed since it's not a huge space. They also have great drink specials.",1
2125,6,5,11/13/2014,If you've ever visited Spain this is the place to go! Live Flamenco every Thursday and Saturday night! Amazing tapas and sangria is on point! A bit pricey but worth the money especially with the live performance!,1
2126,6,4,11/12/2014,"We stumbled across this place, and it was a wonderful delight. The food was delicious and the service was great and very friendy. Wonderful choice of wine. Definitely recommend it if you get a chance!",1
2127,6,5,11/2/2014,"Had my 25th birthday here last night and it was AMAZING! The food was delicious and the service couldn't have been any better. They were so nice and accommodating and made my birthday so special. If you're in the area you absolutely have to go here! I will definitely be back with a big group of friends. Also, you should Def get the mango sangria and skirt steak! You won't regret it.",1
2128,6,4,11/2/2014,"I like the flamingo performance on Thursday night. The performance was well-prepared. The dancer even warmed herself up half an hour before the show. The food is good with fair price and size. The service is attentive. Just want to remind ppl the show starts at 8:30 on Thursday. If u want to see the show, better to mention it when you make reservation.",1
2129,6,3,10/26/2014,Live Flamingo dancer!! Best part of the night. The service was quick and the food was decent.,1
2130,6,5,10/25/2014,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Great vibe, great food, love that the plates are so small, but so extremely delicious! The blueberry sangria is my favorite! Amazing staff! Moved back to California, I miss this place so much! Highly recommend!",1
2131,6,1,10/20/2014,"It's going to be really hard to write this review, the rating is not because of the food or drinks, those were really good. But I do appreciate when a good manager keeps the staff in checked. When we got there we were told that the pitcher of sangria was $10 in happy hour. We order 2 pitchers before 7pm, among several plates. When it was time to pay the bill, our surprise was seeing the pitchers at full price. And when I asked about it the waiter tells me that the one at that price is the half pitcher. At this point all I wanted to do is talk to the manager, and the waiter in a very rude manner approached us, and claiming that it was a misunderstanding and miscommunication grabbed the bill (which was handwritten) and tore it right there in front of us. As I see things, if it was a mistake (totally posible) I would have fix the pitcher value as a way to say sorry and let the customer pay the bill. At this point with no bill I couldn't pay it, couldn't talk to the manager and no tip for the waiter of course after that behavior. It seems very dubious to me and my friends that this guys destroyed the bill without trying to come up with another solution and talk about it. I consider myself a very understanding costumer but I don't answer good to rudeness and when I feel some type of dishonesty is happening I can't let it go. Hopefully this was a one person thing and I had bad luck.",1
2132,6,4,10/10/2014,"Their Flamenco dancers on thursday nights had me out way past my bed time. Not to mention the $20 happy hour (until 7) pitchers of sangria - we ordered 3 flavors with the pomegranate blueberry champagne and red being my favorites! Food: delicious gambas, patatas bravas, paella, mussels, sausage and onions, and can't forget the manchengo cheese.",1
2133,6,5,10/9/2014,"The East Village makes me angry but Nai Tapas makes me happy. It also makes travelling below 14th street totally worth it. Their appetizers are perfect. Not many things in the world are perfect, but I feel good knowing that Nai Tapas has perfect tapas. Every time I have gone there, I've had an awesome experience. Some of my favorites include the shrimp in garlic sauce and their clams and mussels. I can eat that all day. The only difficulty in eating here is that you're supposed to share tapas (so I've been told), but if you're anything like me -you'll want to hog everything. Go there, enjoy the sangria and the tapas and the vibe of all the people around you. This place is always awesome",1
2134,6,5,10/8/2014,"Great place to have tapas, great sangrÃ­a (not to sweet, thank you!). The food comes out quickly and the staff is very, very nice. Thank you for the lovely evening. On saturdays and sundays you have to make a reservation, the place is full because of the Flamenco performance.",1
2135,6,3,10/7/2014,"We strolled in here when another restaurant had over a 50 min wait. This had none especially by the bar. Actually glad I came when there was no flamenco show mostly because I needed some quiet after an insane day at a work conference. We had a pitcher of sangria, which was alright. We shared some tapas, which were all alright. The best was the octopus tapa. Some of the others were unmemorable. The tapas version of the paella was meh. I wasn't a fan and it definitely tasted like the steel pan. All I could taste was metal. Wouldn't recommend it. The waiter was nice though. So, it's alright. Not sure I'd rush back here.",1
2057,6,4,10/5/2014,"Came here for a birthday dinner and we tried an assortment of tapas till we were busting at the seams: shrimp with garlic, calamari in its own ink, fried cod fish, mussels, sardines on toast, paella, cheese plate, chorizo, clams, ... the list can go on! Good food, friendly service, prices OK, not cheap, though. Unfortunately, we missed out on the flamenco show but there's always next time!",1
2136,6,4,10/4/2014,"This is the first of what I can only imagine would be many trips here. Pitchers are $20 and glasses are $4. We had just eaten so we were not interested in food (plus I'm more interested in liquid calories come happy hour time). As a group of 4, we decided to come here one night for happy hour which runs until 7pm. We easily sat at the bar and began chatting up the bartender, Dave. He was very friendly and instantly was joking with us. We only had a little over an hour left of happy hour so we had to choose wisely on what pitchers to get. We started with blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria. It was delicious and it quickly disappeared. Round two: We got just a simple red sangria. Delicious and also quickly vanished. I finally found a magic act I enjoyed! But wait there is more. Around 640, we received a THIRD pitcher of mango sangria. I love mango so this was right up my alley. By this time, I opted to break the seal thinking happy hour was over. Boy was I wrong. By the time I returned, Dave granted us one last pitcher of tropical sangria. Again very good but this was a little too sweet from what I think i remember. Now let's do the math, albeit improperly. 4+4=1. 4 people, 4 pitchers, all in just over one hour. Not too shabby. They were decently strong, but we are all pros at sangria-ing. By the time we left there was a line of people waiting for dinner. I'm not sure if I would have a sit down dinner but I would definitely return for a pitcher or two at the bar and maybe a few plates of tapas for good measure.",1
1545,6,4,10/2/2014,"Their dark wood tables and chairs give a very cozy feel. Â  Hard to resist the $20 for a pitcher of sangria during their happy hours. Â And the sangria wasn't bad at all, and we liked that they didn't fill the pitcher with too much ice. Â  Food was pretty good and the tapas portions were enough to be shared 2-4 ppl. Â Very friendly staff.",1
2137,6,5,9/29/2014,"Such a fun place for dinner, especially Saturdays or Thursdays when they have flamenco dancers perform. The food comes out pretty quickly, the sangria is sweet, and the staff is super helpful and eager. Croquettes. Shrimp with garlic. Bread with tomato and manchego and jamon. All winners.",1
2138,6,5,9/26/2014,I had my birthday party here on a Saturday night. The manager that I arranged the party with was so helpful and very flexible. We had about 20 people- all you can eat small plates and unlimited sangria and it was one of the best deals in the city and such a great time. The flamenco show was just the icing on the cake. I have planned and been to many birthdays all over the city and this was one of the best experiences I have had- so easy and no stress involved! I would highly recommend this restaurant,1
2139,6,4,9/26/2014,Delicous food and friendly bartender. Came here on a whim on a Friday night and had a great time.,1
2140,6,5,9/26/2014,One of my favorite spots in nyc. The sangria is amazing and love the shrimp and meatballs!!,1
2141,6,5,9/24/2014,really good. must go,1
2142,6,4,9/23/2014,"It was great! I met my friend here for a catch up session. Low lighting so great for a date, but it was a little loud and hard to hear my friend. I love the spanish feel of the decor. The staff was friendly and very accommodating. The food came out quick and all of it was delicious. I would recommend the mussels, egg omelette and the skirt steak.",1
2143,6,5,9/21/2014,"Obsessed with this tapas place! Good food, live flamenco, fun times. Such a good place for a Friday night dinner with friends.",1
2144,6,3,9/20/2014,"This is a very nice place with a Flamenco dance show. I don't know the show is every day though. The food was OK, but not super nor memorable. We had a Paella and Octopus and it was pretty authentic! The drinks were pretty good as well. We had the sangria and although it was delicious we didn't order a second one because It was late already. The environment is really enjoyable. I may give it another try, especially if I'm in a ""flamenco"" mood.",1
2145,6,3,9/19/2014,"I'm giving 3 stars just because the tablao flamenco was GREAT; it shows they really enjoy what they do and that they are passionate dancers. No need for reservation thou, the place was half-empty. The food was OK; not exceptional. The sangria was good although a bit on the sweet side. Pulpo was overcooked.",1
2146,6,4,9/18/2014,"This was our second time to nai tapas. The last time we went there was a couple of years back. Both times for someone's bday and our experience has been awesome so far. The staff is great. Very welcoming and attentive. Our server both times was uno and he is very friendly and even offered to get us drinks on him because we were waiting for our table even after making reservations. Luckily we only waited for a few mins before we got our table. We went on a Thursday both times and they have live flamenco performance on Thursdays and sat nights which was just as good as what we remember last time. The food is fairly good. We ordered a bunch of small plates ranging from snail to chicken to shrimp to potatoes to goat cheese, all of which were pretty decent for our taste. We would go back not just because of the food but all of the other factors mentioned above!",1
2147,6,5,9/15/2014,One of the best & most delicious tapas house in the city. The service is super and everything on the menu is decently priced. I highly recommend the mussels and skirt steak paired with mango sangria. If you come with a group. you'll be able to try a variety of tapas!,1
2148,6,5,9/12/2014,"This is my go to tapas place in the city. Â The staff is super friendly, checks up on you, and makes thoughtful recommendations on the menu and drinks. Â The food is great as well. Â The tapas don't come out all at once, so you can take your time to savor each one. Â For two people 5 tapas is enough food. Â I recommend the empanada, ox tail, and fried goat cheese... yummy. Â  If you can, try to get a reservation, this place does fill up during dinner hours.",1
2149,6,4,9/7/2014,"Delicious sangria. Happy hour runs until 7pm, which includes $20 pitchers of Sangria and $4 glasses. The place itself looks quite romantic yet casual. They offer a nice variation of tapas which average $7 for half serving or $14 full serving (average more or less).",1
2150,6,4,9/5/2014,Typical east village vibe. Hanged out with friend over several tapas and glass of sangria. Variety of choices on the menu from Â seafood to meat (and you might want to have every one of them!) My favorite is the braised ox tail with tropical sangria!,1
2151,6,4,9/3/2014,"Went here last Sunday night for tapas with some friends from out of town. It's a cute place. What we ordered: Churrasco Arriero (skirt steak), Albondiguillas Estofadas (meatballs w/ brandy sauce), assortment of cured meats & cheeses, grilled shrimp w/ garlic, and Patatas Alioli (potatoes in creamy garlic alioli). We enjoyed everything, but the potatoes in creamy garlic sauce & meatballs w/ brandy were my personal favorite. I could have eaten another whole order of the potatoes! To drink we had a pitcher of Blueberry pomegranate champagne Sangria and a pitcher of the Mango Sangria. The Blueberry pomegranate was AMAZING. Seriously hit the spot. Next time I come I would like to try some of the other small plates like the octopus, mussels, or croquettes, but overall the food & service was great.",1
2152,6,4,8/25/2014,"Now this place is all sorts of cute fun. We came here on a Saturday night for dinner and the last minute 10:30 Flamenco show. I have never even heard of the place or noticed it in the past even tho I've been to the bakery next door pretty often and in general, searching for eats within the area quite often as well. I wasn't sure what to expect, but my experience here is nothing but positive. Our server, Uno, was a hoot and made the experience that much more pleasurable. We ended up with 7 tapas plates between the two of us and it was more than filling. Bacalao, skirt steak, ham with fried goat cheese, mussels (a little on the puny side), and I can't remember as always what the rest was........ but for sure a place to check out",1
2153,6,3,8/20/2014,"Went here with a friend for dinner. We ordered five things: 1) Octopus: so-so. They boil the octopus so it has a snot-like texture on the outside. Taste is alright but not the best preparation. 2) Chicken Croquettes: Good dish. Would order again. Would benefit from a sauce (they just give the croquettes by themselves). 3) Coconut Crepe: good dish but not accurately described on the menu. It's more of a seafood filled dumpling. Quite good. But not a crepe. 4) Mussels in wine sauce: quite good. Nice sauce and preparation. Good amount of mussels as well. 5) Salad. Besides white asparagus, the only vegetarian dish on the menu. I'm an avid meat eater. But seriously? Two vegetarian dishes on a menu of more than 30 items? Seems like laziness. Also getting the bill took ages. Overall okay meal. Wouldn't go back, but the meal was not bad.",1
1648,6,5,8/18/2014,"Great tapas, flamenco guitar n dancing show was fantastic. It's on the repeat list.",1
2154,6,1,8/17/2014,"Really disappointing food. We went here for tapas and flamenco on a Thursday and though the dancing was cool, I wouldn't waste your time here. A ton of fried and heavy food, even when it wasn't obvious on the menu. The seafood paella was disgusting with no flavor and what looked like instant Spanish rice (no joke). Chicken croquettes looked and tasted like something you'd buy from the freezer aisle of a grocery store. Everything tasted processed. The worst part? Even the sangria was gross. Their red sangria was all sugar and no alcohol. We went here since the Yelp reviews seemed promising and were sorely disappointed.",1
2155,6,5,8/12/2014,"Brought my parents here and had a great experience. The food was amazing, the staff was very nice, and the flamenco dancers added that extra spice. I highly recommend the Tabla De Quesos Y Embutidos even though it is a little pricey for such small portions but the flavor is spot on. The empanadas were also amazing (so far, haven't had any bad empanadas in NYC). If you're drinking, try the sangrias (we got mango and it was to die for). This is a great little place in EV so I'd say groups of 4 or less are ideal. And make sure to make a reservation since they can get pretty packed.",1
2156,6,5,8/9/2014,"I went out with my wife and a family friend tonight. It was awesome, from the food to the setting. The bartender was great, and we had a great time.",1
2157,6,3,8/9/2014,"A disappointment. Â Tapas were not all that authentic. Â The gambas ajillo were unrecognizable from the ones I had in Spain. Â The squid in ink was mediocre at best. Â Sangria was respectable, but otherwise not recommended if you are looking for an authentic Spanish tapas experience.",1
2158,6,5,8/7/2014,"I am from Barcelona and this is my place to hang out when I feel homesick. The pulpo a la gallega and all the omelettes are awesome. It might be a little over price but on average in the city... I can't compare NY prices to Spanish ones, I guess. Service is the best. David, the manager, is very kind and nice as well as the bartenders. Stop by and enjoy the tapas and Estrella Damm beer!!!",1
2159,6,3,7/29/2014,I have been to Nai a couple of times. Â This time it was not so good. Â In the past it was out friggin standing. I am not sure what happened. Â The tapas did not have the same depth of flavor and spice they had in the past. I would not recommend this place to any of my friends unless I go back and get the tapas I had last year.,1
2160,6,2,7/25/2014,"Tried a range of tapas... Pan Tumaca, Churrasco Arriero, Croquetas De Jamon, Empanadillas De Carne, Pimientos De Piquillo Rellenos.... they were ok, but nothing that I'm craving to have again. Red wine sangria was ok, not awesome.",1
2161,6,2,7/17/2014,Red sangria gets a solid rating for not being sweet and having great happy hour pricing ($5 for a large glass and pitcher special too). Servers were very friendly. Place was packed on a Monday night - good sign. Food was disappointing. Chorizo was overcooked and the chicken and ham croquetas were average. Patatas bravas were soggy instead of crispy/crunchy and the sauce was so spicy it over powered any other flavors. Go here to relax with some friends over sangria and get good service but not a real food destination.,1
2162,6,3,7/17/2014,"This place is sort of like it's hood: sloppy, sweet, cramped, a little sweaty, messy and fun. If you like sloppy, sweet, cramped, sweaty, messy and fun. It's also pretty cheap. I would wonder how they do it, but the quality is just not amazing , so I don't wonder, I just appreciate they don't overcharge for mediocre tapas. I've tried everything on the menu. I would like to say that something stands out, but that would be untrue. The chicken is good, chorizo ok, asparagus ok, patatas bravas, meh, tortilla espanola, ok. Sangria - white is better than read. We had a mango sangria that was pretty refreshing but overall the alcohol's sole purpose was to make the food taste better and ambiance less hectic. If you consider tortilla flats, great Mexican, then you will like Nai for Spanish food. It's meh, but sometimes a good imitation is sufficient.",1
2163,6,5,7/15/2014,"Great tapas, very reasonably priced. The garlic shrimp & chorizo w onions was among the best I've ever had. Seafood paella was great too but a bit on the fishy side. The skirt steak could be sliced a bit thinner. Overall very pleased with the food and service. Red sangria tops off a great experience.",1
2164,6,5,7/13/2014,"Amazing. Â Sangrias, beer, tapas, service, atmosphere. Â I even tried and enjoyed the sardines!",1
2165,6,4,7/5/2014,"We stumbled across this place, and it was a wonderful delight. The food was delicious and the service was great and very friendy. Wonderful choice of wine. Definitely recommend it if you get a chance!",1
2166,6,5,7/4/2014,"NAtive to the Iberian peninsula I appreciate great spanish cusine. This place takes me from nyc and leaves me feeling like I am in Sevilla for the night enjoying wonderful tapas and beautiful authentic flamenco show. The food, especially the octopus was delicious and cooked to the perfect consistency. Also the chorizo and oxtail were amazing. I have been here about 4 times and will continue being my go to spot for great Tapas.",1
2167,6,4,6/27/2014,"We had the patatas bravas, escargot, chorizo sautÃ©ed in onlions and mussels in a spicy broth. Overall excellent food, great place for tapas. Cozy ambience. We had the red wine sangria and the pomegranate sangria. The drinks were great!",1
2168,6,5,6/25/2014,"Nai Tapas Bar was an incredibly fun experience with authentic and delicious food. The sangria is amazing, and so was our waiter! I came here with 7 friends for a birthday dinner and would recommend it to anyone. Plus, Mon-Wed right now there is a $20 pitcher of sangria deal! Amazing place.",1
2169,6,4,6/15/2014,"This was the first restaurant my friend brought me to after landing in NY. There was only a bit of a wait when we Â the food was delicious. Mostly all the tapas we got were delicious, with one or two tapas tasting okay. One thing you have to get: The Blueberry Pomegranate Champagne Sangria!! It's light and refreshing, and super delicious! I want to say it was worth it, but it was a little on the pricey end for tapas. However, I'm from California, where food is definitely cheaper, so the price may be ""normal"" for New York standards.",1
2170,6,1,6/13/2014,The tapas here were terrible. Â The seafood croquettes were recommended by our waiter came out horrible and mushy and chewy. The octopus was boiled and tasted kinda rubbery. Â The empanadas had a delicious meat filling but so much dough distracted from the whole dish. Â I did like the fried goat cheese balls with ham over bread. Save your calories for a real tapas place. Â The waiter was nice since I feel like he knew i wasn't too happy with the food.,1

2172,6,5,6/13/2014,"First time trying tapas and definitely won't be my last, thanks to the great experience I had here! Service was excellent! The waiter was very helpful and offered recommendations. The people there were so nice. Food was delicious. We got the churrasco arriero (skirt steak), pulp a la gallega (octopus), caracoles (escargot), and pelotillas de queso de cabra (fried qoat cheese). Everything was delicious, got to try all different flavors! My favorite was the skirt steak; it was cooked very well and the dipping sauce was very tasty. Drinks are good too; we happen to come when it was happy hour. For $4, we got a big glass of sangria and it was really good with just enough alcohol! Not very expensive for good food! Definitely will come here again!",1
1578,6,5,6/3/2014,"Absolutely love this place, hands down my favorite restaurant in the city (I promise I don't work here!). I discovered it randomly over 4 years ago (when I think it just opened), thank you Caracas for not being able to accommodate our party that night! All the food I've had is absolutely delicious. I always get gambas al ajillo (garlic shrimp), pulpo a la gallega (octopus), mussels, and potatoes and a variety of other stuff. I usually get the tapas portions of everything and split it with the rest of my table. I've been to Spain twice and the food here feels authentic. Still haven't tried the paella which must have gotten added to the menu sometime within the last year. Lastly, everything is very reasonably priced The sangria is awesome as well- delicious but not too sweet. The service is excellent and friendly. Don't miss their free flamenco shows on Thursdays and Saturdays at 8:30 and 10:30. The shows are awesome and run close to an hour. Make sure to make a reservation if you wanna see a show, I think around 2 weeks before to be safe. I made my last reservation 2 months in advance to make sure I can take my parents after graduation, but that was a bit excessive and I think the staff was a little shocked. Overall, feels like a little and delicious piece of Spain in the middle of the East Village. I've been here probably close to 10 times by now and I can't wait to go back!",1
2173,6,4,5/31/2014,"This place is pretty legit. As far as tapas go it's pretty solid, granted I don't eat pork or seafood so in prob missing their best dishes, but what I did have was pretty good. Although the Patatas Bravas and Asparagus were not as good as I had hoped, in fact they were kinda bad. The chicken croquets and Empanadas were on point. It's a good place for a crowd, it's very noisy though so a get to know you date may be better suited elsewhere. The good thing about this place is that it's true Tapas. Everything is small and about 5 bucks so you can order about 5 dishes and share them!",1
2174,6,1,5/31/2014,"Absolute worst restaurant in manhattan. Terrible staff, terrible food, terrible time. I would recommend it only to my worst enemy.",1
2175,6,4,5/28/2014,"Good tapas place. Can be a little loud but otherwise good date place. Recommended: Croquetas De Pollo, patatas bravas",1
2176,6,5,5/26/2014,"Remarkable, spot-on tapas served by gracious, helpful staff. In my many outings to Nai, I've yet to be disappointed by any dish. Most notable are the galician boiled octopus and the paella, which often sells out given its popularity/ ridiculous level of deliciousness. However, Nai stands out among its East Village competitors due its superior pacing. If you order red sangria, your meat dishes will arrive first. White? The seafood is brought promptly to the table. They sell an awesome, sweet seafood crepe that makes for a perfect savory dessert, which conveniently arrives right at the end of the meal. Small restaurants in New York are often driven to maximize covers, rushing their diners through disorganized meals. Nai's consistent attention to detail and order makes it a real gem. Wait for a table, you won't be sorry.",1
2177,6,4,5/23/2014,"If you're a fan of great food in a cozy environment with amazing Flamenco performances, you must check this place out. There were not that many vegetarian options but dishes we ordered were all excellent, except for one. What we ordered: Patata Bravas - Nice spicy kick in the sauce Patata Aoli(?) - My second favorite dish that had garlic aoli on top of square potatoe fries Coconut seafood crepe - My favorite dish that had shrimp and crab inside small dumpling looking crepes Goat cheese Croquette - Small portions. We only got 3 small croquettes... Mango Sangria- Definitely worth it. For $7 you get a huge glass of tangy, perfect sangria. White Asparagus with pink sauce - Unlike what other reviewers said, this dish did not work for me or my friends. It was mushy and just plain not appetizing. However, the waiter was so kind to take it off of our bill when we asked.",1
2178,6,5,5/19/2014,"I was visiting from out-of-town with my gf and we found Nai. We had to wait a good hour for a seat at the bar, but the sangria was really really good and put me at ease making the wait no problem. We shared pulpo en su tinta, pulpo gallega, a Spanish Omelette and jamon y queso. I especially enjoyed the pulpo en su tinta, but my gf didn't. She gagged just looking at me enjoying eating the octopus smiling w the ink sauce from it all over my mouth. Â Maybe it's because I spent several months in Spain that I was unfazed by the presentation of pulpo en su tinta. My plan is to bring my dad there when we go on a business trip to NY in June.",1
2179,6,4,5/17/2014,"Came in on a Saturday night so we could catch the flamenco show. Ordered a couple of their tapas and some wine, oh my it was delicious! Everything we tried was cooked perfectly and well seasoned. What stood out the most were the ""gambas al ajillo"" and the ""pulpo"". You can taste the difference and the authentic flair compared to other tapas places. We were seated right in front of the performers and it was delightful to enjoy our food to flamenco dance. Definitely coming back! Â warning: this place is packed on the weekends, get a reservation if possible.",1
2180,6,4,5/14/2014,"I went there twice. The first time I was very impressed with the tapas, the sangria and the music (some Manu Chao, Jarabe de Palo, Julieta Venegas). Very tasty and quick service. The 2nd time, I went with the same enthusiasm but, despite it being a weeknight again, the staff seemed too busy/overwhelmed to even talk to us. The 1st person asked us what we want, we said we want a table, he told us to wait. 5 minutes later we hadn't heard from anyone. I asked another person, she said she'll check to see if there's something and came back 1-2 minutes later saying there's only place at the bar. Not sure why this was, there seemed to be some empty tables (maybe they had an event to prepare for, not sure) but we were hungry and left. I'll definitely go again, but did have a bit of mixed reaction.",1
2181,6,5,5/11/2014,The food is great here. So are the Sangria's . The service was well and I loved the entertainment. It would be best to make reservations.,1
2182,6,5,5/11/2014,Good place!! Small so make reservations. We ended up eating at bar because even with a reservation it was a long wait. Yum tapas good drinks and if your lucky some entertainment.,1
2183,6,4,5/11/2014,"Really good sangria. Food was tasty, and lots of good options! There were still more items on the menu that we wanted to try.... More filling for your buck than most tapas places. Would like to return for the dancing!",1
2184,6,5,5/8/2014,"Obsessed with the place!!! Â Wait is always long but the food is delicious and the manager/owner is so nice that you rarely care about the wait. Â Love the food - literally have had one of almost everything on the menu and am never disappointed! Â Sangria and prices are excellent too! Highly recommend for a girls night out, date night, when family is in town, etc -- have never brought anyone who didn't immediately love it!",1
2185,6,5,5/8/2014,"Starting from the way you are greeted at the bar (thanks Dave!), every person who came in contact with us was polite, helpful and gave great suggestions. Â We went here for our 2nd anniversary, and it was a perfect night. Especially suggest trying the ham croquetas (or any croquetas for that matter), and the garlic shrimp. Â The coconut crepe with scallops, crab and shrimp was also delicious, and the fried goat cheese never disappoints. Beyond the food, they also had a great beer and wine list, which was very affordable ($9 - 11 glasses of wine). Â I must mention the staff one more time, because everyone made us feel very welcome and felt truly sincere. We definitely plan on returning here without a doubt, since there were a few dishes and the sangria that we still want to try. Â Don't forget to pick up an Italian pastry next door on your way home too. Enjoy!",1
2186,6,5,5/5/2014,"One of favorite restaurants in nyc, though only on Thursday and Saturdays because of the live flamenco music. With this as a complement to the tapas served here, you're really in for a perfect evening. I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. The tapas they serve here are great and the paella is pretty good as well. Notables include the Gambas, patatas bravas, croquetas, any dish with sardines and the chorizo. The paella was pretty good in addition to the house bread which you definitely need to dip in your Gambas oil. The only bad criticism I have was that the sangria could've been a lot better as it tasted bland and watered down. Otherwise great restaurant for any occasion !",1
2187,6,3,5/5/2014,My husband and I were looking for a good Tapas place and found this one on a Yelp. Unfortunately it did not I've up to the favorable reviews - food was just fair and service was slow.,1
2188,6,5,5/5/2014,"A group of 6 of us went to Nai for my brothers birthday party. Wow! What a fantastic time. The foot was superb, the waitstaff was on point, and the flamenco was fantastic (just like I remember it in Spain)! Since it was my brothers birthday they invited him up on stage to dance. It was a great night that we will always remember. Thank you to all the staff and dancers for an unforgettable evening!",1
2189,6,3,5/1/2014,"i'm disappointed in this restaurant because while the food was good, i felt there were many technical and conceptual errors that if tightened up, could have made it great. none of the bread was toasted. Â i don't know if that was intentional, but i really felt the cold, slightly stale bread took away from the meal. Â the one tapas we got with toasted bread really paired well with the curizo, so i'm disappointed all of the bread wasn't toasted. Â  the sauce on the asparagus was just a misfire to me. Â i'm sure it's made from scratch, but it literally tasted exactly like thousand island dressing and did not pair well with the asparagus. the tortilla was somewhat underwhelming and bland. Â the paella was border line inedible salty. Â i don't even necessarily blame them for that. Â it happens. but just another example of careless errors. the grilled sardines were solid, but again, wish it came on toasted bread. Â the Patatas Bravas were another solid dish. Â the sauce on that was crack. Â we got one tapas with fried cheese and that was great. the meat/cheese platter was underwhelming. Â felt like i was at a suburban dinner party and someone just opened up a meat/cheese packet from plastic. all in all, i didn't dislike this restaurant, i was just disappointed by it. there were a few great bits, a few terrible bits, but mostly it was just solid, unexciting food. Â i would not come back here again.",1
2190,6,3,5/1/2014,"Came here this past weekend for a friends birthday, awesome food, weak but yummy sangria, and a pretty rude waiter. First off, the food. We got so much I'm not even sure of everything we had. Stand outs include the coconut crepes, the skirt steak, and the meatballs. You can just order as you go so be careful, it does start to add up! One of the Â things they pride themselves on is their sangria selection, we ended up getting the pomegranate blueberry champagne sangria, the mango sangria, and the red sangria, all of which were delicious but the red was the only one with any kind of kick to it. I don't know about you but when I drink through 6 glasses of sangria I expect to feel some kind of buzz after. Lastly our waiter was super ""pleasant rude."" He wasn't outright rude but he did have a bit of an attitude with us and tended to be super disapproving when we didn't take his recommendations. Not a big deal but a bit annoying. Go for the food and go for the flamenco, they have live dancing on weekends!",1
2191,6,4,4/29/2014,"This was a great evening had by all!!! Â First of all you must make a reservation if you want to see the flamingo dancers on Thursday or Saturday evening. The dÃ©cor is rustic but clean and looks very authentic, with small wood tables, a large wooden bar and other old world wood items to make it feel like an old wine cellar...I like it!! I went with a group of six and we tried several plates, and all of them were very tasty. Â I was pleased to see that they make small plates and large plates of each item. Â If you're with a large group get the larger plates it a much better deal and you can go back for seconds All I will say is get a pitcher of SANGRIA....don't short change yourself on the experience!!!!! Now the best part of all was a mini Flamingo dance show....I was totally surprised and thoroughly entertained!!! Two female dancers & 2 musicians turned everyone up and brought them to their feet. Â It was an awesome job so much so I want to buy the unattractive shoes and learn how to flaming dance A+ for this place I will Â be back....DEELISH!!!!!",1
2192,6,5,4/29/2014,"I've been going to nai tapas for at least the past 2 years. It's my go to tapas and sangria place. Their happy hour for pitchers of sangria run till 7pm. The tapas, omg the tapas are sooo good. My favorites are Â  Croquetas De Jamon, Patatas Bravas,Gambas Al Ajillo, Pulpo A La Gallega, Croquetas De Bacalao, squid in its own ink and the meatballs are sooo good. Every time I go there, I leave there satisfied. The waiters are so friendly and arent afraid to joke around with their customers.",1
2193,6,4,4/25/2014,it was great,1
2194,6,5,4/21/2014,"Go for the octopus, stay for the flamenco music, stay even longer for the house sangria. I dined with ten others, and the service didn't miss a beat. Far better than the surrounding tapas options. Head in either early or very late, this place is packed from 7:30 - 10.",1
2195,6,5,4/20/2014,"Came here for a friend's birthday. We ordered like half the menu and everything tasted so amazing! The tapas that really stood out for me was the Patatas Bravas - their house special sauce brings liiiifeee to mee, potatoes are perfectly made Croquetas De Pollo - warm cheesy goodness, i actually couldnt tell there was chicken in here, but the mixture of melted cheese was soooo good. also had the Croquetas De Jamon which was less cheesy and more ham, also great. Seafood paella - perfectly seasoned, not overly salty, so much flavor, rice is cooked to PERFECTION, seafood not overcooked. One of the better ones I tried. Empanadillas De Carne - loooved the beef filling, loved the outer flaky shell even more. Besides the food, we also tried 4 pitchers of their house sangria. My favorite was the mango sangria. Afterwards, they had flamenco dancing performance. Their band and the dancers were amazinggggg. We felt like we took a trip to Spain for dinner. Â Very great ambience. Waiter was very friendly and kept checking with us for more drinks and food. Would definitely come back, be sure to make reservations!",1
2196,6,5,4/20/2014,Heard about this place from a friend. Boy was I glad that I did. Was easily able to reserve a table for 2 @ 10pm on a Thursday. Just in time for the flamenco dancers. Loved the decor. Had the champaign sangria was delicious. You'll wanna get the full pitcher. We had ordered 4 dishes to share. Steak was delicious and also had goat cheese. Any plate that passed looked great! Waite staff friendly and always kept my glass full. I will return,1
2197,6,5,4/19/2014,"This place is definitely worth trying out! Visited this place to celebrate my friend's birthday, our waitress was very friendly and attentive, our food was great. We mainly tried the vegetarian options and ordered pitchers of Sangria. This seems like a fun place to catch up with friends and relax after work!",1
2198,6,3,4/15/2014,"Food was ok...some plates were better than others... If you're in the area then ok to stop by, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. Churrasco Arriero skirt steak sautÃ©ed with garlic and spicy cherry peppers- good flavor but overcooked...meat was too chewy Albondiguillas Estofadas stewed meatballs in a brandy sauce...meatballs too mushy and sauce was too sweet, not one of my favorite dishes Gambas En Salsa Verde grilled shrimp in parsley, wine & garlic sauce- tasty but nothing to write home about",1
2199,6,4,4/9/2014,"Good service, great tapas. My wife and I ordered about 5 dishes, which were enough for both of us to share. We went during happy hour so our drinks were cheap",1
2200,6,4,4/7/2014,"This is a great place to eat. Large selection of tapas and sangria. We split four tapas between two people and that was plenty. The mussels and garlic shrimp were both dynamite. Definitely recommended, and there are plenty of good spots nearby for pre/post dinner drinks.",1
2201,6,5,4/6/2014,Wonderful place! Friendly service! Came when it was $20 pitchers of Sangria. The food is delicious-especially the fried goat cheese. The mussels are also delicious...and the blueberry champagne sangria is absolutely to die for!,1
2202,6,4,4/5/2014,"Great service, attentive but not over the top. Food was terrific. Escargot, blood sausages, cured meat platter with cheeses were fresh and delicious. The garlic shrimp, seafood croquettes had heaps of flavor. Seating was comfortable, wife and I had a blast. Sangria has love in it :) So does this charming place. We'll be back.",1
2203,6,5,4/5/2014,"great food, awesome vibe and I would suggest making a reservation so that you don't have to wait.",1
2204,6,5,4/1/2014,"I just figured I would update a year later. I have returned to Nai with my brother for several birthdays and other various celebrations and we are always amazed with the fantastic food and service, keep up the amazing job. Also you MUST try their house sangria (I'm partial to the white) especially if you enjoy a sweeter sangria.",1
2205,6,5,3/28/2014,"Had a wonderful birthday dinner here! We came on a Thursday, so were able to enjoy the Flamenco dancing. Â For a few minutes we forgot we were in NYC and were transported to a small restaurant in Seville. Â  The tapas are all very fresh and come out nice and hot. Â The sangria is a little on the sweet side, but delicious nonetheless. Highly recommend!",1
2206,6,4,3/26/2014,"Great food and a really nice staff. Â The hanger steak, shrimp in garlic sauce, and fried goat cheese dishes were incredible. Â Try the squid cooked in its own ink if you're feeling adventurous - it's pretty fishy, but a cool experience. Â  Their sangria pitchers can be a little pricey relative to other places nearby, but they do have half-price pitchers some night of the week. Â Also, the menu can be a little overwhelming because it lacks organization.",1
1591,6,3,3/24/2014,"I can only comment on the food, since I don't really drink, but the sangria choices sound amazing! BF brought me here for my birthday the other night. Despite the cruddy weather, the atmosphere at Nai was lively and upbeat. We got a table towards the back. The server was really friendly and answered whatever questions we had about the menu items. I think between 2 people about 5-6 tapas plates is good, depending on how big of an appetite you have. We had: + Churrasco Arriero - skirt steak (fabulous!) + Gambas Al Ajillo - garlic shrimp (make sure you have bread for dipping!) + Caracoles - escargot (also good for dipping bread) + Empanadillas De Carne - beef empanadas (very filling) + Croquetas De JamÃ³n - serrano ham croquettes (better than the chicken one since there's a bit more saltiness that brings out more of the flavors) + Croquetas De Pollo - chicken croquettes Overall I would recommend it for a nice evening out with friends for socializing over small bites and sangria.",1
2207,6,3,3/23/2014,"This is place should have an overall 3 or 3.5. I just think 4 is a but too generous. Made a reservation for 2 and still waited 45 minutes... they did make up for it by giving us a pitcher of complimentary sangria, but it came when the check came and we were ready to start the night out...so we didn't drink much of it anyway. Food was OK, not amazing... had the octopus, garlic shrimp, and pickled tuna. None were amazing, a lot of butter in all the dishes. I have had better tapas and I probably wouldn't return nice we live in the city of thousands of restaurants, but always glad to give new places a try!",1
2208,6,5,3/18/2014,"I wandered into Nai several years ago for the first time. I have been there now a total Of 5 times. Service is always friendly, if a little frazzled. Wine choices favor Spanish ( no surprise). This and sangria makes me happy. But the piece de resistance is the live flamenco on Thurs an Sat. Book at least a week ahead, they have become super popular. Again, no surprise. Food is a volition pricey for portion size, but always fresh and tasty.",1
2209,6,5,3/18/2014,Great food - Great server - Reasonable prices...this place has it all! Definitely will go back!!,1
2210,6,4,3/17/2014,"Went with 4 girlfriends on a Friday and there was a great crowd. Â We split 4 tapas and a pitcher of sangria and ended up only spending $20 each . Â That is a steal for NY. Â We had the mussels, skirt steak, patatas with garlic aioli, and fried goat cheese. Â Everything was really great. I probably would skip the goat cheese next time though. Â The portions are big too. None of us left hungry. Â I will definitely go here again and try to make the flamenco show. Â I recommend making a reservation.",1
2211,6,5,3/16/2014,"Boyfriend and I just went here and it was amazing! Cozy rustic atmosphere with brick walls. Low lighting and not overly decorated We got the pomegranate and blueberry sangria. Delicious And a bunch of tapas. We got... Shrimp in garlic sauce, meat and mixed cheese platter, ham croquettes, spicy tomato sauce potatos, fried goat cheese, meatballs, and the coconut crepes. All were absolutely amazing! Our least fav was probably the meatballs but it was simply bc they werent AS awesome as everything else Reasonably priced as well. Super friendly service. Our waiters name was Uno and he was amazing!!!! Recommended dishes. Answered questions and was attentive but not overbearing Will be going back. Next time on a flamenco night",1
2212,6,5,3/8/2014,Excellent portions. Delicious taste and reasonable pricing ! Fabulous tapas and very tasty sangria. The flamenco nights are out of this world !!,1
2213,6,4,3/6/2014,"Spectacular selection of Wines and freshly made Sangria per Monday through Wednesday Happy Hour Special. The Decor was very indicative of a Spanish Taverna in Anadalucia. The Gambas Al Ajillo and Calimar in its own ink were flavorful and delicious. I was not overly impressed by the Jamon, but overall a step up from the normal overpriced sensationalized Tapas restaurants indicative of Manhattan. Good Tapas involves simplicity and good company.",1
2214,6,4,3/5/2014,"Very charming place, lots of good choices of Sangria, must haves are the Garlic Shrimp (save some bread to soak up that sauce) and Chorizo dishes.",1
2215,6,5,3/4/2014,"I love everything about Nai Tapas!! It's a great place for groups/birthday parties... I've been four or five times with a party of 5+ and everyone always has a great time. The food is delicious (get the garlic shrimp and dip the bread in the sauce!) but not too expensive, the sangria is great and the service is good too! I've seen the flamenco show twice and it's really fun -- both times we were sitting right in front and it was pretty loud, so don't plan on having any deep conversations during it (lasts about 30-45 mins i think?).",1
2216,6,5,3/2/2014,"Nai Tapas is awesome!! Amazing food, great service, centrally located in E. Village and perfect for large groups. Came here last night for one of my besties' birthday. We were a group of 10, and so when my friend made the reservation, the restaurant suggested a fixed menu of $40/ person for dinner and unlimited pitchers of sangria. What more could you ask for at $40?! Great price point. This place is pretty casual for a tapas bar - not overly romantic or fancy by any means; but the food is authentic, the crowd is low-key and even if you weren't from E. Village, you easily could feel like a local here. The food was AH-mazing. Cannot get over it. We were all stuffed to the brim yet continued eating because we just couldn't stop ourselves. Here are the dishes that were brought out to us from the menu - 2 portions of each plate were served for the group (plus baskets of bread): - Gambas al Ajillo (shrimp in garlic sauce): ***my favorite dish*** - Bacalao Frito (lightly fried fresh cod): the fish was as soft as butter and the dipping sauce was tasty - Croquetas de Pollo (chicken croquettes) & Croquetas de Jamon (Serrano ham): both so good! - Tortilla Espanola (traditional Spanish omelette): probably my least fave of all as the flavor was very mild - Patatas Bravas (potatoes coated with spicy house tomato sauce): tasty but very spicy! - Patatas Alioli (potatoes basted in a creamy garlic alioli sauce): bomb.com! - Charrasco Arriero (skirt steak): awesome dish; meat was very tender - Albondiguillas Estofadas (meatballs in brandy sauce) - Chorizo a la Plancha (grilled Spanish sausage): very tasty Wow. We ate a LOT!! My fave was definitely the shrimp & the croquettas. Least fave: the tortilla espanola (though it was good, there were other potato-based dishes already served that this felt excessive). The sangria pitchers kept on coming and being refilled! ** Dessert time (though honestly, who has room for more food at this point?!): The birthday girl and one other from our group is gluten-intolerant, so we brought our own cake for dessert. The servers were helpful by bringing out the cake with a candle and then they cut up the cake for us. We didnt stay for the live flamenco dancing, as we were on our way to sing some karaoke down the street at Planet Rose, but towards the last hour of dinner, there was a small band playing live flamenco / salsa music and it was a fun atmosphere. We will all definitely be back! Service was excellent. Can't wait to try more dishes from the menu. I had never heard of this hidden gem before but am so glad it was introduced to me.",1
2217,6,1,2/28/2014,I don't understand how this place can get so many 4-5 star reviews. The food here is less than average especially for tapas in NYC. I Â did not think the sangria was good and the decor was nothing special. The service also did not impress me. I will definitely not be returning here.,1
2218,6,4,2/26/2014,"word of advice if you want close seats near the flamenco show make reservations a week in advance if you want really good seats in front of the flamenco show make reservations two weeks in advance. I found this out, after the fact I made reservations two days before the flamenco show, even after the guy told me ""you will not be sitting near the flamenco show if that is okay?"", I said yes in hopes of sneaking up to the front during the flamenco show to catch a glimpse of the dance.... boy was I wrong, this place is pretty small and the stage for the flamenco dancers are even smaller. When I went up to try to get a glimpse of the show, I was blocking the people sitting at the bar and the waiters/waitresses hustling and bustling by. Â One waiter finally said ""you have to move, you are blocking everybody."" Whoops... anyway flamenco show aside (which was pretty awesome for the few seconds I caught of it) Â food was pretty decent. I got the blueberry champagne sangria that everyone raves about it, and it is delicious- all bubbly and fruity and deceptively strong. One of these bad boys will definitely get you a little tipsy. For the tapas my friend and I shared the: 1) Plates of cheese and cured meats- I loved the manchego cheese- so soft and delish and the meats were good too 2) The fried goat cheese- all fried and tangy and once you bite into it, the cheese just oozes right out. 3) The garlic shrimp-- the sauce is thick and garlicky and great paired with bread 4) The clams diavalo -- the dish actually came out kinda cold, the sauce was really spicy and good but Â I wasn't a huge fan. 5) The chorizo with quail egg - presentation is so cute with the tiny little egg on top and it was quit tasty but I feel like it's better off without the bread on the bottom and just chorizo and egg. I kinda wish I had more chorizo in the dish too. Overall the food was great and our waiter (Uno) Â was amazing. Would love to return to try other tapas and hopefully score some good seats",1
2219,6,4,2/24/2014,"Worth all of the hype! I visited Barcelona, Monsant, Rioja and Madrid this past December and have been craving tapas, Spanish charcuterie and cheeses ever since. I can be particular about food and am always skeptical about places in NYC- I'm always of the opinion that most restaurants survive even if they are mediocre simply because there are so many people in this darn city that they inevitably will have a full house even if their food/service isn't great. Well this is a serious neighborhood spot, hidden gem, worth all of the positive reviews! Service was welcoming and polite, if you have a little wait just grab a drink from the bartender, they will transfer your tab. The atmosphere is cozy and can be great for a romantic date night or a group birthday. They have a tv at the bar if you care for that- I think they were playing some futbol game, and they play Spanish pop music (Juanes, Bebe etc) softly, enough to be enjoyable but not too loud to be obnoxious. It is definitely worth making a reservation (OpenTable) as this place is very popular for date night, groups (3+ people all the way to 15+ birthday outings). Even if your table isn't ready right away, the host/hostess will get you seated and if the wait is too long they'll even bring by complimentary Sangria. Now for the food! Tortilla EspaÃ±ola was excellent and good-sized (we had leftovers that we gladly took home for breakfast), Albondigas (great , slow-simmered sauce), Gambas Al Ajillo Â (Shrimp in Garlic Sauce- you could just order two orders of this and a basket of bread and call it a day!), Grilled Sardines with Red Pepper on Toast- fresh, grilled perfectly!; and Pan Tumaca (toast with tomato, manchego, Jamon Serrano). Everything was fresh, authentic and tasted very similar to tapas I have had in Spain. The only thing I wasn't thrilled with was the Pulpo with Smoked Pimenton (octopus with Spanish Paprika). It was obviously the kind from a can- which in a pinch if you're craving it, can be ok- and the texture was unappetizing. If you are the type that likes authentic grilled, fresh Octopus (such as the type they serve in Greek/Mediterranean restaurants or other Spanish places; Pulpo a la Plancha), this is not it. This is the kind from a can, warmed up, tossed with olive oil and smoked paprika. Wasn't a fan. In addition, they were out of the Jamon croquetas which was disappointing, since that should be a staple item, but it was a busy Friday night. We had wines by the glass and a half pitcher of Sangria. The Sangria was ok but I am a wine purist and don't like wine/liquor punches or mimosas, but my friend enjoyed it. All in all, if you are prepared for a cozy, neighborhood spot that is popular, make a reservation and GO! There were two large groups, at least 10 people, at the same time we were there, and the waitstaff was able to serve them as well as the regular tables with no problem. They work hard and seem to enjoy their jobs, we always had water refills, etc, no problem asking for extra bread or an extra fork. Definitely recommend!",1
2220,6,5,2/22/2014,"Such a beautiful place! I came here to celebrate valentine's day and it was just perfect! The locations narrow space can be a bit claustrophobic making it my only drawback abt this place. There is no easy way to maneuver through ppl. You have to move out of the way and be cautious not to bump someone else while doing so. With all this said I highly recommend making reservations to avoid this awkward dance with ppl. Plus who wants to wait more than 15mins for a table to become available?! Ok, first the drinks! I had a regular glass of sangria for $7. Not only was it delicious but it was huge!!! My dilemma was whether to order the half pitcher or a glass. The glass all the way! It was strong, and delicious. Â By not ordering the half pitcher you can also try the diff sangria flavors, like i did. (I had the tropical sangria it was fruity but I def prefer the regular sangria). Just keep in mind 1 glass is sufficient but who can deny wanting to try as many flavors?! The food!! Yum yum yum! My absolute favorite were the meatballs and the empanadas. The pollo al ajillo was mmmmmm so good. The mussels were ok. This food reminded me of my moms cooking! How could I not give this place 5 stars? With those four plates it was enough for two ppl. They also constantly refill our bread basket which is nice bc you are able to use it to taste the sauce from the meatballs, chicken etc. The flamenco show which was suppose to start at 8:30 was just a cherry on top to the dinner. Unfortunately, there was a bday going on so they slightly blocked the stage but we were still able to enjoy the performance and music during our meal. They even invited the bday girl on stage!! For me this place is def on my list for bday considerations!!!",1
2221,6,3,2/18/2014,"Met up with a girlfriend to catch up, we hadn't seen each other in, well, let's say, way too long. I'm giving this spot 3-stars not based on food, but only because it was chill, we sat for hours and were unrushed and the service was pretty good. Â We shared tapas which were just so-so and unfortunately don't warrant a return visit. However, if you need a place for tapas, pretty good service in a relaxed atmosphere in East Village this might be a good spot for you.",1
2222,6,5,2/17/2014,"I came here on a Thursday night to enjoy some drinks and a Flamenco show. Â Warning: Â This review is NOT about food. We ordered a pitcher of the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria and it was amazing. Â If only all sangrias could be this good...It had the perfect balance of sweetness, bubbles, and kick from the alcohol, leaving you with the best kind of happy buzz. Â The flamenco show was unreal. Â You could see the passion in the performers' faces, this includes the dancers and the musicians. Â I remember half way though the show thinking how thankful I am to live in Manhattan because without leaving the city, I could feel like I teleported to Spain for a few hours. Â You get so sucked into the show that you forget you're in New York! If you want an authentic, intimate experience, this is your spot.",1

We were seated they knew exactly who we were. (on the reservation i noted it was his birthday and when they called me to confirm the reservation i mentioned if we can perhaps have a flan sent to the table.) they were amazing. The food! We had: The garlic shrimp - amazing! oh my! it was delicious! the skirt steak - amazing as well! the paella - my boyfriend loved it (i thought it was okay) the meatballs - not our favorite the goat cheese balls - Â  i loved them amazingly crunchy and soft on the inside. (the mister has never had goat cheese and fell in love) the snails - great experience so you can say you have tasted them but ive had better. coconut flan - i was too stuffed to eat it the mister ate it all (and he is not a big fan of coconut... ) I had the red sangria and he had the mango 2 glasses. :) since it was his birthday he got asked to join the flamenco show. It was amazing! We had a blast! he had Â blast, enjoyed the food, enjoyed the show, enjoyed the service. Will i go back again? ummm YES! we are already talking about what we will have. Must go, must experience!",1
2224,6,4,2/11/2014,"I celebrated my birthday here on a Saturday night, which is one of their flamenco performance nights. I got a great view of the stage and was blown away by the dancers! Definitely make a dinner reservation around a show time. It's worth it. In terms of food and drinks, there are a variety of sangria choices and all the tapas we ordered were pretty good. There were so many tapas options it was almost overwhelming, in a good way. The service was great! Jenny, our server, was incredibly welcoming and attentive. I had a great night!",1
2225,6,5,2/9/2014,"Can't beat east village for food, and this place proves that. A very authentic Spanish restaurant with all the tapas I'd had in Madrid, and done well. There was flamenco dancing sat night, which made for great entertainment. This is place is wonderful for dates and chats with close friends. There are just good vibes there, just a great place.",1
2226,6,5,2/8/2014,"Upon the recommendation of a regular, I met up with friends at Nai Tapas and was totally blown away by the awesomeness of this place! It's not huge, so definitely get there before 7pm unless you have made a reservation. There are a number of specialty sangrias, which you can purchase by the glass, the half pitcher, or a full pitcher. Consider them! All the tapas come in large and small sizes, so I recommend ordering about 6-7 (for a party of 3) of the small sizes, especially the: Churrasco Arriero - skirt steak sautÃ©ed with garlic and spicy cherry peppers Albondiguillas Estofadas - stewed meatballs in a brandy sauce Gambas Al Ajillo - grilled shrimp in garlic sauce Almejas En Salsa Verde - clams in parsley, wine and garlic sauce I loved all four of these dishes!! I also tried the new oxtail item on the menu, but realized oxtail just isn't for me. I am glad I tried it though. Service is outstanding and friendly, and I understand there are flamenco dancers some nights. I cannot wait to go back, possibly with my Book Club or a date!",1
2227,6,5,2/4/2014,"Food was amazing! ordered oxtail, beef empanadas, and so much more. We had a party of 5 and with at least 4 cocktails the bills was under $200. In addition to the flamenco show, this place is a gem! Celebrated my birthday and I would take a star away because they had all the people who were celebrating their birthdays there get up and dance but I had so much fun it didn't matter. Definitely go there but make a reservation. This place fills up quick and runs out of room on the nights they have the flamenco show.",1
2228,6,5,1/26/2014,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Â We've spent lots of time in Spain and this is just as good as being in a local Spanish bar! Â The food is amazing, the service is great, the atmosphere is fabulous especially the weekend evenings when they have music and dancing (I'm not sure of the schedule, but when you catch it it's great). Â They also have my favorite spanish drink, Tinto de Verano.",1
2229,6,3,1/21/2014,"Update: unfortunately their food was not as nice as before...but they still have nice stuff, live flamenco and good atmosphere. Would I go back? I don't think so.",1
2230,6,5,1/20/2014,"The first time I came here I ordered the oxtail. Something the bf never had before. I had to put him on. It was an amazing experience and I was happy to share it with him. I can definitely consider this my new go-to tapas spot. The food seemed to have some thought put into it and quite ethnic. Lots of variety and the servers are very nice. Try to get the high-seated tables, it seems to carry the ambience well, instead of the low seating section tucked away in the back.",1
2231,6,4,1/13/2014,"What a wonderful place! Â Cozy, comfortable and low-key, this tapas bar has it all. Â The staff is attentive and actually happy to be there! Â The food is delicious: from the chorizo on toast topped with quail egg, to the stuffed peppers, to the skirt steak to the Seafood Payaya (their way) everything exceeded expectation. Â  I can not wait to go back!",1
2232,6,5,1/10/2014,"Fun Thursday night! Came around 8pm for my boyfriend's birthday and were treated to a live flamenco show. Food was delicious and the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria was amazing. I had called ahead to see if they could bring out a dessert for the birthday celebration. INSTEAD, my boyfriend and I were both surprised when the live band called his name over the mic to have a birthday dance with one of the flamenco dancers. Definitely recommend for a fun date night.",1
2233,6,5,1/6/2014,"One of the best tapas places in NY! Food was amazing and all people working there are super friendly. My group went for my friend's birthday Saturday night. The Flamenco dance every Saturday made the night a lot more fun and engaging. They served us a slice of birthday cake for free and ""allowed"" my bday friend to dance in front of everyone. Will definitely come back.",1
2234,6,5,1/6/2014,"If you live in or are visiting NYC: COME HERE! Make a reservation for Thursday or Saturday at 8:00 or 10:00. And prepare yourself for a fantastically free flamenco show!! It was amazing and thoroughly entertaining, they even make people who are celebrating their birthdays get up and stomp away! I would strongly suggest bringing a friend so you can try more of the amazing menu. But if you're solo like me request a seat at the bar so you can watch the flurry of sangrias and possibly make friends with the bartender or people sitting next to you. This is also a great date spot if you're looking to romance someone over passionate dancing and tasty nibbles.",1
2235,6,4,1/5/2014,"We went there for a quiet dinner on New Year Eve. We made a reservation the day before. We got a nice seat by the window. The server was very polite. The food was pretty good. We LOVE the ox tail dish very much. It is a MUST to order! We had a few other small plates they were all very delicious. They came in a generous size and reasonably priced. The spicy potatoes is another one to try. We had a few other variations before, this one is pretty good. We also had the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria. it was delicious. We will definitely go back!",1
2236,6,5,1/3/2014,"Tasty tapas with complex flavor. Maybe better then Spain, just sayin",1
2237,6,5,1/2/2014,"I need to come back here ASAP. My friends and I came without reservations on New Years Eve around 9pm (although I tried to make a reservation online, but as expected on NYE, no luck). We were greeted by David, who was so incredibly nice and hilarious! He said he wasn't sure if there were any openings, but spent several minutes to check (I guess to analyze the restaurant crowd and to see if anyone was leaving). He came back, said the wait was 5 minutes, which was fantastic since I expected to be turned away! We weren't staying for the whole night when he asked us, and when we fervently assured him we weren't, he enthusiastically asked us ""why not? you should!"" ... which was another response I wasn't expecting (I thought he was going to say 'good, because we're booked and you've only got the table until the next party comes' or 'we're booked for the rest of the night' or 'you can't have the table forever'). I believe my waitress was named Jenny, who is also just as charming and helpful. Food was delicious! I had to get the seafood paella, my friends got this delicious fruity salad and some other things I cannot recall... we stayed a good amount of time before leaving to our New Years Eve engagements, sad to leave this great find. But I'll definitely be back (next time to enjoy the drinks)!!",1
2238,6,4,1/1/2014,"Had a delightful tapas dinner here on a recent Sunday evening. The platter of meats and cheeses, the simple chorizo dish, the patatas, and the garlic shrimp were all very well prepared. They forgot our order of the octopus, but we were plenty full so no harm, no foul. We washed it all down with a nice bottle of rioja. We were still engrossed in conversation after we finished our bottle, so they continued to top us off from their open bottle at the bar -- now that's good service.",1
2239,6,3,12/28/2013,"I came here with my husband for a date night and was slightly disappointed. The ambiance is good. Cozy and welcoming. Kinda of dark with the exposed brick walls. I liked it. What I was not impressed with was the food; we ordered pretty much everything off the menu, Â because that's what we usually do. Lol I can honestly say that the OCTOPUS WAS THE BEST!!!!!! Most tender and juicy. Â One of the few you can find in the city. However, all the rest were just ok... not blown away. Blend, not much flavor, Â greasy, etc. I would come back here just to have some drinks and the octopus. Not for the entire dinner meal though.",1
2240,6,5,12/28/2013,"My boyfriend and I have been coming to Nai for years and when my brother came to town with his fiancÃ©, it was a no brainer that this is where we would be taking them. We went on Thursday so we saw the amazing Flamenco dancers and, as usual, the food was perfect. We ordered multiple pitchers of Sangria (red, champagne, and blueberry champagne) and each was more tastey than the other. Some of the best Sangria we've had. Our favorite dish is usually the fried goat cheese on toast, patatas aioli, and mussels. Can't wait to go back soon. Hands down our favorite place in the city.",1
2241,6,4,12/26/2013,"Is this place real? Or did I dream this glorious dinner experience? Not really sure because everything about our night and experience here was AWESOME and for such a great price. Located in the East Village on 1st between 10th and 11th, I have passed Nai many times, and never thought anything of it. Nai came recommended to my friend Rachel which was perfect since we were craving two things: tapas and sangria. Okay... Where do I begin? Our waiter was one of the most attentive, friendly and knowledgable people I have ever encountered at a restaurant in this city. The service we experienced throughout our 3 and 1/2 hour meal at Nai Tapas got me thinking about how fantastic service has become rare, and we have just gotten used to mediocre service and being rushed in and out of restaurants so the next party can be seated. This is not the case at Nai. We enjoyed our dinner with warm welcome, as we were continually told to take our time, and thoroughly enjoy our food and drinks. And thank you sir, we did just that... On top of the 5 star service at this modest, authentic Spanish restaurant on 1st Ave, they offer happy hour until 8PM. $20 pitchers of sangria, with 4 flavors to choose from, the most important and insanely delicious being: the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria. Rachel and I shared 2 pitchers throughout the course of the night and couldn't get enough. It was probably the best sangria I've had since sitting on the beaches of Spain, and with a sweet, bubbly, fizzy, happy buzz from the champagne. (I brought another friend 3 days later for happy hour). Nai offers a long menu of authentic Spanish tapas, ideal for ordering a bunch and sharing. This was a mission within itself since we wanted everything on the menu. Luckily for us, our waiter provided helpful tips, how they are prepared, and his personal favorites. They start you off with a baguette and olive oil, while you take your time and peruse the menu. We ordered seven tapas throughout the night, two or three at time, to stagger the flow of our meal while we enjoyed each, and sipped our sangria. Everything we ordered was fresh and flavorful, transporting me right back to Spain for the night, four blocks from my NY apartment. What to order: Fried goat cheese balls wrapped in Serrano ham with a slice of tomato on toast. Amazing. ($6) Gambas Al Ajillo- Grilled shrimp in garlic sauce. Garlicky, plump shrimp. ($6) Bacalao Frito- Chunks of cod, lightly fried. Fresh, crispy, and perfect with a squeeze of lemon. ($6) Patatas Aioli- Potatoes in a garlic aioli sauce. Crispy potatoes. Creamy garlic aioli. Unreal. ($5) Caracoles- Escargot in our house sauce. Escargot. Butter sauce. ($5) Albondiguillas Estofadas- Stewed meatballs in a brandy sauce. Tender, rich in vibrant spices. ($5) Stuffed peppers with ham and Manchego cheese, topped with Quail eggs. Over easy quail eggs. Melted cheese and ham on toast. ($7) Coconut Flan (Not pictured since we devoured so quickly). Delicious, creamy, sweet, tons of coconut. ($5) What I've been dreaming about for our next visit: Lomo Adobado Con Pimientos Asados- Seasoned pork loin with fresh roasted red peppers Pan Tumaca- Toast with a coating of tomato, topped with serrano ham & manchego cheese Madrid Tropical- Baby spinach, avocado, hearts of palm, sliced oranges, walnuts, red onions & strips of red peppers tossed in our house vinaigrette Mejillones A La Cerverza- Mussels cooked with shallots, garlic, cilantro and lager Pulpo A La Gallega- Spanish octopus in virgin olive oil, sprinkled with sea salt and sweet paprika Croquetas De JamÃ³n- Serrano ham croquettes",1
2242,6,5,12/21/2013,"Very warm and inviting place. Wait staf is helpful and very friendly. Tapas were wonderfully tasty, especially the oxtail. You will love Nai",1
2243,6,5,12/20/2013,"Really like this place! They have house-made sangrias, live flamenco entertainment thur/sat 8:30pm and 10:30pm. The tapas recipes are very interesting, they're specifically Galician. Very cool! We did not make reservations, and I strongly recommend that you do, but they were so nice and tried their best to seat us.",1
2244,6,4,12/20/2013,"Four of us came out here last night to enjoy the late night flamenco show. Nai is your typical East Village underground establishment: quaint but makes the most of its size to create convivial environment. Exposed brick walls, sconces which emit intimate, cave-like lighting, built in arches depicting the daily life of a Spanish seÃ±orita, and an overall authentic charm that only Tapas places hold the key to. My friend made the reservation for the 10 pm show (no cover charge(!), but it was booked for the earlier time slot at 8:30) and I would definitely recommend proceeding with reserving in advance because the place gets packed tighter than boquerones. For drinks, we decided to stick with the sangrias which were amazing. The regular version had the perfect balance of sweetness and one bite into the apple revealed that the fruit flavors had been replaced by liquor splendor. We also went for a pitcher of the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria which was absolutely delicious. I only had about 2 glasses and I was definitely feeling their effects quickly (though I'm sure the drunken fruit had something to do with that as well). The show is absolutely amazing. Willa Bronce, the Romanian Gypsy who gives most of the solo performances, is stunning. My eyes were transfixed as we watched her dig her soles/soul into that dance floor, whipping her hair around like a whip and clapping her castanets with the vigor of a crab's claws. The music, at once hypnotic and sultry, is sensational and makes for quite the passionate evening. My only complaint is that I wish the show was longer than the set hour! Nevertheless, it's places like Nai that make me thankful I live in a city where I could easily bask in the heat of a flamenco show without having to travel to Spain. I'll definitely be back to Nai for some more flamencho fire and perhaps even a tapas or two.",1
2245,6,4,12/17/2013,"Awesome, awesome drinks! very good food. We tried at least 10 dishes and were not disappointed with any. We also went on a Flamenco night and enjoyed the performance.",1
2246,6,5,12/13/2013,"I have been on the lookout for a good tapas place in NYC. So far I've been underwhelmed. Everything has been alright so far. Nai Tapas stepped it up a notch. Could it have been that I was mildly intoxicated with their DELICIOUS blueberry sangria? Probably. You're saying to yourself: ""Blueberry sangria? That can't be! Also, I hate blueberries, so NO!"" All I have to say back is: SHUT UP AND GET IT! My lady-friend doesn't like blueberries either (I know, why am I still with her?) but she was all over their sangria. BLUEberry? More like HAPPYberry (Get it? You do). We had a selection of different tapas to accompany our drinks: patatas bravas, chorizo, meatballs, cheeses and a host of other stuff that I can't remember. The main take away: run, don't walk here. Stop everything that you're currently doing. Facebook can wait. Tell your boss the TPS reports are coming in late (and yes, you will remember the cover page this time). ""But Jaime..."" you say (God, you're whiny today), ""How's the service?"" When I say that I wanted to be best friends with the wait staff, I mean it. They are super friendly and helpful. They also play great music that made me feel as if I was back in Spain. Bottom line? Do I really need to write it? I mean, you're pretty certain this places is like Spain, but in the city. I gave it five stars and spent 4 paragraphs (oh God, this makes 5!) talking about how amazing it is. Do yourself a favor and stop reading. If you're still moving your eyes to follow these words, you're an idiot. STOP! Direct your body towards Nai Tapas. Now. You can thank me later in between swigs of sangria.",1
2247,6,4,12/13/2013,"Made a reservation here this past Tuesday for 6 p.m. I arrived around 5:50 with my cousin and we were the only diners here for until around 6:30 (then it started getting busy). We were greeted and seated promptly, our server (forgot his name) was excellent throughout the whole night. He came to our table quite a few times asking how our meal was, refilling water/alcohol, and we shared a small conversation about my upcoming backpacking trip to Europe. We ordered large everything (except asparagus). Gambas al Ajillo (shrimp in garlic sauce), Mejillones RÃ­as Baixas (mussels), Pintxo de Chistorra con Huevo de Codorniz (spicy chorizo/quail egg/manchego cheese toast), Chorizo Riojana (chorizo/potatoes/egg yolk), Rabo Guisado (braised oxtail- the winner at our table), Esparragos Navarros (white asparagus- first time trying, we didn't like this. kinda too mushy for my liking, and no taste. the server did inform us of the difference though between white and green asparagus), & Tabla de Quesos y Embutidos (assorted cured meats/cheese). After ordering, our server asked if I've ever been here before because I ordered all their favorites/popular dishes. I said nope, but Yelp brought me here! So thank you fellow Yelpers! EVERYTHING (except the white asparagus) was DELICIOUS! The bread basket they give you is also perfect for dipping in the sauces/delicious goodness. We also ordered a pitcher of Tropical Sangria, and it was good. Maybe a little too fruity, and we didn't taste all that much alcohol, but that could be because we are alcoholics in training. I will try the other sangrias next time. I really liked this restaurant's food, and I would come back again. The GREAT SERVICE we received here was a cherry on top of a great dinner!",1
2248,6,5,12/11/2013,"AMAZING. Â Service, food, music... Can't recommend Nai Tapas Bar more!",1
2249,6,5,12/10/2013,"The best spicy clams of my life. Almejas Diablo. Spicy, salty, savoury. Simply amazing. They were ao delicious that I wiped the sauce with the bread. And I NEVER eat the bread. Gambas al Ajillo - after the clams, this was my second favorite. Perfectly cooked shrimp (hard to come by) in a garlic olive oil sauce. Wine - great Sangria! The rest of the wine selection is so-so",1
2250,6,5,12/10/2013,"I took my date here Saturday night and we had a blast. We didn't have reservations, which was my mistake, so there was a 45-minute wait. The host was very accommodating though, and he provided us with bar stools to sit on while we waited. The waitress was friendly and attentive, the food was delicious, and the entertainment was great--a very festive and appropriate atmosphere. Highly recommended.",1
2251,6,4,12/7/2013,"Pomegranate sangria FTW! Service is fantastic and prices are very affordable. The paella however was more like a rice dish and not in the traditional pan with all the crunchy deliciosuness on the bottom, still good but I had different expectations. Mussels were amazing! Did I mention the pomegranate sangria? It is a MUST!",1
2252,6,4,12/6/2013,All of our dishes were amazing. The best ess the chorizo over playfully pepper and toast topped with fried quail egg and manchego. Highly recommend!!,1
1132,6,2,12/6/2013,"Having heard great things about this tapas bar, my friend and I decided that we would catch up over some wine and tapas here. Alas, the tapas just don't compare to the lovely plates at places like Casa Mono or Boqueria. For sure, Nai is nowhere near the same league as the aforementioned. Although the dining room only had one table seated when I arrived, I contributed that to our early meeting time. Because, as we were heading out, the dining room was near capacity. Maybe I should have taken the empty tables as a sign when I walked by and canceled my reservation, but I hate scrambling for another dinner option at the last minute. Plus, what's the harm in trying a new place? We opted for a pitcher of blueberry-pomegranate champagne sangria. I appreciated the fact that they have quite a few options that don't use red wine as a base. Not that I don't like red wine, but because it makes me sleepy. The sangria was not overly sweet, slightly tart and quite refreshing. And, since we were dining early, we got the entire pitcher at happy hour prices ($20)! That's probably the only part of the dinner that I enjoyed besides the company. The waiter suggested 2-3 tapas per person, so we figured 5 would be a good number. Pan Tumaca - barely toasted bread with barely a drop of tomato juice topped with serrano ham and manchego cheese. I should've known not to order this when I saw that it was topped with ham and cheese. When I order pan tumaca, I really just want garlicky tomatoes on nicely toasted bread. What a disappointment. Pulpo a la Gallega - octopus with paprika, olive oil and salt. I was looking forward to grilled octopus, but this seemed boiled and tossed in the paprika and oil. It had a mushy texture and some pieces seemed to have this oddly gel-like consistency. Gross! Bacalao Frito - basically fried fish nuggets served with an aioli. Nothing special and the batter was not crispy. Patatas Alioli - potatoes in a garlic alioli sauce. The potatoes were not crisp enough and absorbed all the alioli sauce, which just made it even soggier. Caracoles - escargot in a house sauce. I didn't completely mind this only because the snails came in a really good garlic sauce. I would've liked if more had there been toast to soak up all the sauciness. I made do with bread from the bread basket and sopped up the sauce - no shame! Maybe we ordered wrong, but I can't say that I was impressed with any of the dishes we ordered. And even though I liked the sangria, it wasn't something that would bring me back to this place. I'm guessing that most people come here because the price points are low, but I'd much rather pay more and enjoy my food than cheap out and have a bad dinner. Sorry Nai, I'm going to have to say nay to a next time...",1
2253,6,5,12/6/2013,"Came here for my friends birthday dinner at around 8:30/9 on a Wednesday. Let me just say, the place is a tad hard to locate (literally wandered on the same block aimlessly for a good minute before I looked up and OH! well...THERE IT IS!). The service here is AMAZING!!! Our waiter Unueo (prounounced UNO, like the card game), gets an A++ for his top notch recommendations, funny jokes, and impeccable service. He was not only attentive, but paid extra attention to tiny details for the birthday girl (ie: big ol' sangria glass with extra fruit and our mini surprise, a slice of cake with candles at the end of dinner). This guy was nothing short of AWESOME! PROPS TO YOU SIR! Onto the food...The sangria pitchers on Mon-Wed are $20 (they have around 6 or 7 options to choose from flavor wise). We tried the champagne sangria as well as the mango flavored one. The mango was more on the sweet side while the champagne was perfect for me, not too sweet or strong. For 3 girls, two pitchers was more than enough! As for the tapas, they have two options: tapas and regular size. We did 6 tapas and 2 regular sizes, which was a lot more than we originally decided to order, but we somehow managed to finish it! A few favorites: Churrasco (skirt steak) - cooked perfectly and had a side of their own version of chimichurri sauce(ask for extra!) Mussels in paprika sauce - the sauce was amazing!!! We did not allow him to take away the sauce after we were done with the mussels and ate the entire thing of free bread soaked in this very sauce, haha! Shrimp in garlic sauce - We all loved this one too, and my friend kept saying ""I cannot believe I just dipped all the bread in oil and garlic sauce"". It was really THAT good! Oxtail - tender and juicy! A recommendation that was def on point if you enjoy oxtail as much as I do. A nice and cozy spot that I've heard has some type of music show on Fridays. Probably best to avoid it if you're planning to talk a lot!",1
2254,6,4,12/5/2013,"The good: -- free flamenco show on Thursdays and Saturdays at 8pm and 10pm -- delicious food -- amazing sangria choices -- good location in the trendy East Village The bad: -- can get crowded during flamenco shows -- forget to have a conversation during the flamenco shows -- service can be average (a bit slow at times) -- can get expensive, but not too expensive",1
2255,6,4,12/4/2013,"This place is lovely! The staff is super friendly, and helpful. coconut crepes stuffed with shrimp: this was probably the best thing we ordered. anchovies served over toast with fresh minced garlic: after reading the Serious Eats review: Â newyork.seriouseats.com/â€¦ we decided we had to order this. Neither of us have ever tried anchovies, we may not order it again-I think we're just not anchovy fans. fried goat cheese over a slice of tomato & toast wrapped in imported Serrano ham: how could this not be good? Serrano ham croquettes: this was a favorite stewed meatballs in a brandy sauce: again, Serious Eats raved about this and it was very good. The sauce is delightful with bread.",1
2256,6,5,11/20/2013,"Whenever I have someone visit me from out of town, I bring them here. The staff is great. Very friendly and attentive. The menu is amazing. Lots of variety, fresh tasting, savory, and not too expensive. They have specials on the sangria (many kinds) and a large beer list. I've gone without a reservation, but it takes a second to make one through this site. Even the olive oil they give you with the free bread is delicious, and I loove olive oil.",1
2257,6,5,11/18/2013,"5/5 stars for me. What a place! A definite must go to on a Thursday night or Saturday night. Bring a date, bring a friend, bring a grandparent, bring a stranger! 8:30 and 10:30 on both nights they have Flamenco dancing with Reynoldo Rincon and his family (wife, son, daughter). They do two shows while everyone is eating and talking at their table and it is electric. The traditional dancing, the atmosphere, the energy. Now, to the food! The waiter, Julio, was a huge help. As a group of 4 men he suggested we get 8 tapas. We selected 2 each. I won't go through them all but they ranged from octopus to sardines to serrano ham croquettes to goat cheese stuffed olives. Julio was upset we didn't two of the best sellers (shrimp in garlic sauce and a churrasco with quail egg), so he brought them out anyway. Â UNREAL. We had a few pitchers of red sangria and some after dinner traditional sherry. What an experience. Don't think this is a seafood place only, there are plenty of non-seafood tapas to try. Sit at the bar, get a table, just make a reservation! Until next time.",1
2258,6,4,11/14/2013,"3 for food and 5 for atmosphere and energy and if my math is still sharp - SOLID 4 stars Must get here for a flamenco show on Thursday or Sunday. Â They start at 8:30 or 10:30 so make sure to book in advance because it is as original as it comes (visited Madrid and exactly the same). 10 or so different tapas but the ABSOLUTE must order is the ostrich egg with sausage tapa. Â The churrasco was also tender and excellent. Â I unfortunately cant remember the others but all relatively good. Â Finished off the meal with a couple of light desserts (coconut flan and chocolate cake), maybe they weren't the lightest haha, but you can't go wrong with any of them. Will certainly be back!",1
2259,6,5,11/12/2013,"I went to Nai this past Saturday after I had booked a reservation for 4...for Sunday - ouch! Â The host (David) handled the situation as perfectly as you could ask for. Â He discretely informed me that I had booked for the wrong day as to not embarass me in front of my party. Â Then, he gave me the option of waiting to see if he could find us a space at the bar or come back another time. Â After about 10 minutes, not only did David get us a space, he got us a full table. Â The place was packed so I don't know how he did it, but he pulled it off. After the phenomenal service from David, it continued from our server as well. Â He was patient with our group as it took us a little while to figure out everything we wanted to order. Â He was knowledgeable about the menu when asked, and paced the meal just right. Amazingly, the food was just as good as the service! Â We ordered about 6 different dishes each one better than the last. Â The empanadas were amazing! Â When it was all said and done, the bill came to about $130, extremely affordable for 4 people including 2 large pitchers of sangria. I never Yelp but because I had such an incredible experience at Nai, I felt the need to share. Â I will certainly be back soon!",1
2260,6,5,11/10/2013,Great food. We were in a large group and had a blast. Pulpo a la gallega was my favorite.,1
2261,6,5,11/5/2013,"The food, atmosphere, and drinks give this place an easy four stars. The service bumps it up to five. The staff did an incredible job making out-of-town guests feel comfortable with ordering tapas, and were extremely attentive on both drinks and food. Love this place!",1
2262,6,5,11/3/2013,"So glad I just found a new favorite! I decided to go to dinner for my birthday last Friday for my birthday and arrived with a group of 10. The manager was so accommodating and the service was great. A friend brought cupcakes for dessert and the staff refrigerated them until we were ready and did not charge an additional cake fee. The food was delicious, and very authentic. My favorite was the chicken croquettes but I enjoyed everything we ordered. There are six flavors of sangria and we sampled 4 of the 6, all really good! Since we went on a Friday, I missed the Flamenco show but I will be back soon!",1
2263,6,4,11/3/2013,"A breath of fresh air aming all the overpriced tapas places in the city. Nai is what a real tapas bar should be. Good assortment of tasty small plates, laid back atmosphere and friendly waiters. The food and ambiance reminded me of the tapas bars in Spain. It's not refined or anything, but simple, flavorful and artery clogging. Great place to meet friends and shoot the breeze. Recommend the chorizo rojo, gambas ajillo, manchego & jamon, setas and last but not least a giant pitcher of sangria.",1
2264,6,4,10/31/2013,"Wow! Number one tip for this place: Go here on a Flamenco night and request a table in the dining area to see the flamenco show. Â The flamenco show itself makes this place 5 stars. Â The food on the otherhand is a measly 1 (wah wah wah...). Â I think my favorite food there was the olive oil that came with the bread, but the flamenco and the service is so worth going for. My boyfriend took here for our anniversary; it was an amazing choice. Â We reserved a table for the second flamenco show of the night and arrived to an extremely packed restaurant. Â We had reservations for 10:15 and didn't get seated more towards 10:45 or 11:00. Â It was kind of crazy 'cause there was a large party and they had to kick other people out to accomodate those who had made reservations for the show. I wasn't entirely too happy 'cause we got seated behind another table but it worked out perfectly in the end. Â Once the music started, it didn't matter where I was in the restaurant. The guitarist spoke oceans of emotion with his hands that elegantly strummed his guitar endlessly throughout the night while the flamenco dancers casted their feet to the beat of the music as they spun and twisted their bodies around stage with vigor. Aside from the music/flamenco, we ordered the tapas that Yelp reviewers said were their favorite and ordered a couple of half pitches of sangria. Â The sangrias we got were both good. Â The servic was slow but our waiter was so friendly and nice so I didn't mind. Â Plus, there was a Â really large party so I understood. Â We got an octopus dish, meatballs and empanadas (a seemingly safe choice) but they were all pretty terrible/over salted. Â I could tell they used good ingredients but something just went wrong in the kitchen, multiple times. Â However, flamenco was so good it was really easy to overlook the bad food. I just know for next time not to order food here. In summary-- ultimate power play-- Have dinner beforehand at someplace with better food, come to Nai Tapas Bar for the flamenco show and orders lots and lots of drinks like Sangria to experience the flamenco and the friendly, awesome service.",1
2265,6,5,10/29/2013,This place is fantastic. My friend and I came here last night for tapas and left happy (and mildly drunk from the brandy soaked apples we consumed in our $20 sangria pitcher). The service was excellent in that they were very attentive but not hovering over us every 2 minutes. Every dish we had was delicious and made with quality ingredients. I believe they also have live flamenco music on Thursdays and Saturdays. I will definitely return!,1
2266,6,5,10/28/2013,"Amazing Tapas Restaurant in East Village!! Been twice already and i cant wait to go this weekend. Made a reservation for the flamenco saturday night show and it was spectacular! Awesome food, the goat cheese balls, crepe with seafood and the ground beef pocket bites are to die for!! Service really friendly and courteous!! Music and show something else. Looking forward to go again!!",1
2267,6,5,10/28/2013,Best sangria ever the food is amazing I love this place the service is great plan ahead and make reservations. Â The flamenco show is awesome tho the guitarist is kind of freaky but he can play is A$$ off. Â The food is amazing except the squid on its own ink that's just not for me but everything else is great. Â GO!!!!!!,1
2268,6,4,10/27/2013,"Fun and lively place! There was a 30-45 minute wait on a Saturday night which wasn't so bad. I would recommend making reservations if you can plan ahead. My favorite items are still the blood sausage and coconut flan. We also tried: Shrimp in garlic sauce: The garlic sauce was amazing. We dipped everything in that garlic sauce (our skirt steak, octopus, everything). The shrimp themselves were okay. Churrasco: The skirt steak was pretty bland and chewy. The dipping sauce was too tangy. Wouldn't order again. Octopus: After having the best grilled octopus at Marea the night before, I was really disappointed with the bland boiled octopus here. Mussels in paprika and wine sauce: Very good! The mussels were so tender. Mango sangria: Very refreshing. Tasted like white wine with a hint of mango. Even though our waiter recommend 6 plates for 2 people, we were already stuffed with our 5 plates! Next time we are going to order 6 plates of blood sausage and leave extremely happy.",1
2269,6,4,10/24/2013,"Came here for dinner with a group of 8 friends. Food was GREAT! Their tapas portions are a good size. I did not feel ripped off like certain tapas places that serve 2-3 bite size pieces on a plate and charge you $20 for it. Out of the 8 dishes we ordered, I definitely recommend their chicken croquettes, patatas alioli, braised oxtail, chorizo over toast with quail egg and manchego cheese, and piquillo peppers stuffed with salted cod. The skirt steak was good, but nothing i've never had before. Their mussels in paprika wine sauce was decent...but the actual mussel was kinda small. We also had their berry pomegranate sangria and mango sangria. They tasted great...especially the pomegranate. All in all, the bill was $34 per person. Great price, great food. The only thing we didn't like was the loud flamenco performance, I lost my voice talking over the music and loud noise. Other than that, the restaurant is definitely worth checking out.",1
2270,6,4,10/21/2013,"My girlfriend and I had a great experience at Nai Tapas including a tasty set of small plate tapas and Flamenco dancing!! Â The staff was very friendly and the food was delicious. We first started off with the braised oxtail and seafood croquettes. Â Both dishes had tremendous flavor and provided a good start to a great evening. Â Then came the meatballs, chorizo, and patatas aioli dishes. Â All three lived up to the same quality. Â The beef empanadas came next. Â A delicious classic course that we both enjoyed. The next course was the calamari. Â This was probably the least favorite dish of the evening. Â We both enjoy sauteed calamari but this lacked the flavory taste of the previous dishes. Â However, the shrimp and garlic and skirt steak dishes more than made up for the disappointment of the calamari. Â Both dishes had a flavory taste that satisfied our appetite. Â The tasty dishes also came with complimentary entertainment of flamenco dancing which really created a great atmosphere for dining. Â Overall, it was a tremendous evening of food and entertainment!",1
2271,6,5,10/20/2013,"I was just here again last night for my best friend's birthday, and I cannot put into words how amazing this restaurant is. For service, I would give 10 out of 5 stars, and for food, I would give 9 out 5 stars. It's just that good!! Everybody -- especially Uno, by whom I was served most times I'd visited -- is super duper friendly and caring, and you can just tell that they actually enjoy working there (if not, they're insanely good at hiding it). I brought a homemade cake to celebrate my friend's birthday and asked if it'd be okay for us to eat it after our meal. At first I was worried that they would frown upon it, but on the contrary, Uno was so nice about it, kept the cake in the kitchen until we finished eating and brought it out with a lit candle. He then cut it into slices for us and even packed up the leftovers and washed the plate I brought! We left one slice for Uno (with a generous tip, of course) as a token of our appreciation :) As for food, get the coconut crepes with seafood filling. These will SERIOUSLY change your life and also go great with any of their sangrias (my favorite is tropical). Chorizo con cebollas is also great, as are the meatballs. I've already been here many many times, and that says a lot for me because I rarely ever go to places I've been before. Will DEFINITELY return soon. foodcomalogs.blogspot.coâ€¦ foodcomalogs.blogspot.coâ€¦",1
2272,6,3,10/6/2013,i've definitely had better tapas but i can't complain. it could be a lot worse. had an early dinner there and it was very very empty! but i have heard that it does get crowded due to the flamenco dancing later in the evenings. i'd have to say the little chorizos are delicious,1
2273,6,1,10/3/2013,the meat and cheese platter - Â the meat being cheap pizza topping and the cheese was like the inner sole of a converse all star bought on the bowery in 1941 . the rioja was similar to carlo rossi mixed with chateau diana .. the waitress asked us if our food was good before at had even arrived !!! this place sucked . big time . hasta la vista .,1
2274,6,5,9/22/2013,"Went here last night for my girlfriends birthday. We both live in NJ and decided we needed a night out in the city and through going through a couple of friends, I opted to take her here. Â The food and the sangria were both unbelievable. Â There was a little bit of a wait which was totally understandable for a Saturday night. Â But we bellied up to the bar for some red sangria which was perfect. Â When our table was ready out waitress was fantastic, suggesting some shrimp only based seafood tapas and a few other big sellers. Â Everything was prepared fresh and delicious. Â The icing on the cake, everything including tip was 105. Â Perfect night in the city.",1
2275,6,5,9/21/2013,We stopped by before heading to our dinner spot for happy hour. Â $5 for a glass of sangria $10 for half a pitcher. We asked the bartender what to order and she recommended the blueberry champagne sangria and it is indeed the best sangria I have ever had . Â She recommended about four or five tapas items and we ended up with the mussels with white wine sauce. Â Must say these were scrumptious . Â  It felt like I was in Madrid again! We dipped the bread into the sauce til it was all gone. We will definitely be back again!,1
2276,6,3,9/17/2013,"Nice food, great live flamenco music. Â Get's crowded with long waits and limited seating right before shows so recommend showing up earlier.",1
2277,6,2,9/14/2013,"I came here at a recommendation of a coworker who couldn't/wouldn't stop raving about this place. Â He's been here couple times and each time he would show me pics of the food he and his friends had ordered. Â And I must say, the pictures looked amazing. I came here full of expectations a few weeks back on a date night w my bf. Â I knew I was coming in on a night where there was no flamenco performance so I was counting on the food to deliver. We ordered 5 dishes. Â Only one was outstanding... the others were edible, I suppose, and one dish was outright disgusting. The shrimp and garlic sauce was the best I've tasted in NYC. Â Hands down that dish was the highlight of the dinner. Â We also ordered blood sausage (i'm adventurous and I was trying to get my bf to be as well). Â The dish came with two tiny baguette slices with even tinier halved blood sausage smaller than the size of my ring finger (my fingers are short and thin). Â It didn't taste bad b/c I couldn't taste anything the thing was so tiny!! Â The potato with paprika was good. Â And I don't recall what the fourth dish was, but I vividly remember the disgusting pepper stuffed with salted cod. Â On the menu there were two ways the stuff pepper can be served; with salted cod or with cheese. Â I thought the server had brought us the one stuffed with cheese instead of the cod we ordered b/c the stuffing was creamy (liked instant mashed potatoes but cheesy tasting). Â He insisted it was the cod, so I have to take his word for it it wasn't the cheese one. Â Whatever it was, I couldn't bring myself to take another bite after the first bite. Â My bf just assumed baccala tasted like that. Â Seeing as I've never had baccala, I couldn't attest to its taste but the thing that was stuffed inside the peppers was nasty. Â Ugh. Â And the waitress said this was her favorite dish, too!! Â I felt cheated somewhat. Â But she was very nice and the service was good. Â Though I doubt we'll be back here again. Back to Las Ramblas for my tapas!!",1
2278,6,5,9/12/2013,I absolutely love this place! It is cozy. The service is unbelievable! And every single dish we ever ordered has been awesome!,1
2062,6,4,9/11/2013,"Years ago, on a search for tapas bar flamenco, we were directed multiple times to Xunta (yelp.com/biz/xunta-tapasâ€¦). Unfortunately it closed before we got around to it, but Nai opened (literally) in Xunta's place in 2010. Two bits of advice to help you enjoy your time here: 1) Come on a flamenco night. 2) Come on a flamenco night. Nai does the same flamenco shows as Xunta: Thursdays and Saturdays, 8:30pm and 10:30pm. Tables are empty until JUST before flamenco starts, at which point people swarm in. If you have no reservation, your best bet on these nights is to try to snag a table between sets, around 10pm, when service has geared back up and some parties are leaving. Otherwise, you don't want to be one of the unhappy masses huddling at the entrance, lining the wall, staring gloomily into the merriment inside. Try somewhere else. We arrived early with the intent of taking our sweet time with dinner and drinks - a good idea since service is slower during the show. The red sangria was pretty good! I like the half pitcher option (tip: it's the size of a regular pitcher at Las Ramblas yelp.com/biz/las-ramblasâ€¦). They also have 5 other flavors (white, mango, etc.) for you sangria heathens. As for food, racions (the next size up from a tapa) of oxtail and pan tumaca arrived at our table promptly. The pan tumaca (a.k.a. pan con tomate) is served with slivers of serrano ham and was great. The oxtail was beautifully tender and not at all difficult to eat since it fell off the bone so easily. Typical tapas, like patatas (bravas or alioli) and chorizo a la plancha, are skippable. The patatas were just not that good. The chorizo was very salty, and I was befuddled that the raw egg yolk placed on top was fully cooked on the bottom, as if they had fried an egg and snipped off the whites prior to plating. ?? Our waittress also recommended a new dessert - basically beignets with blueberry goat cheese, and it was absolutely lovely. At this point we were horribly stuffed, and just looking for excuses to stay for the rest of the flamenco... ...which was excellent. Holy vaca, such duende!! Flamenco is more of a furious, passionate spectacle than it is a sexy dance, and the three dancers went all out. You could really feel the rapport between them and the guitarist. There were a few birthday parties in the room and to everyone's amusement, the birthday women + man were called out at the end for an impromptu flamenco lesson with one of the dancers. It was kind of hokey, but you can imagine this makes Nai a perfect place for large groups. Everyone in the room was in a great mood, and the flamenco really contributed to the positive energy. Maybe the sangria helped a tiiiiny bit. Last but worthy of note: Our waittress was super amazing. Friendly, full of recommendations and knowledge about the menu... She appeared exactly when we wanted something, but never hovered. On top of the fact that Nai is a reasonably priced tapas bar with great sangria and really fun flamenco shows, the awesome service was really the icing on the cake (or, the alioli on the tortilla?).",1
2279,6,5,9/8/2013,"Relaxing atmosphere, great service and amazing food at reasonable prices. By far the best tapas I've had to date. Having visited Barcelona and eating my fair share of tapas and sangria while there I can say it truly makes me feel like I'm back in Barcelona. The croquetes de jamon are a MUST !",1
2280,6,4,9/8/2013,"Good Lord! Â 7 for tapas, make a reservation. Â Always make one for huge groups! Flamenco performance transported you to the streets of Barcelona where dreams are made of Rioja and Serrano Ham. Â Casual and homey. Â Get inebriated on culture and a myriad of fruity sangrias. Â Paella, Tortilla Espagnola, Croquetas de Jamon, Pulpo a La Gallega, Gambas al Ajillo, Mejillones Rias Baixas- Winners at our table. Â Bread flows like wine, so you can get your sauce on. Escargot was a little goopy and all I tasted was garlic-but whatever. Empanadillas de Atun- Amazing. Â  Great Service, they understood my terrible muddled Spanish and didn't shrug me off like a gringo. Â The service was rapid and attentive. Beware- if you tell them its your birthday, guess who's dancing with the Flamenco dancers....Do you even lift?",1
2281,6,2,9/7/2013,"Meh. It's all right. I think the best thing about this place is that its GREAT for groups. If you are looking for a decent place for a group dinner this is the place to go. We ordered a bunch of things on the menu, theyre all pretty average. The only thing that pops out are the weak Sangrias... weak... I should reference this at my next AA meeting.",1
2282,6,4,9/1/2013,Service - Good. Held our reservation after I told them we were coming late. We were still able to get the happy hour special when the clock hit 7. Mango Sangria - Light and tasty. The waiter recommended mango and blueberry sangria as the lightest sangrias. Still enough alcohol to make some of us (not me) red. Esparragos Navarros - White asparagus with pink sauce. It was definitely more tender and bigger than normal asparagus. However it is quite expensive - the large has only 4 pieces. It's something you would try once for novelty and not again due to the price to food ratio. Mejillones Avoa - Mussels in paprika wine sauce. It was a bowl of many small mussels as opposed to a few big ones. Sauce is perfect for the mussels but too salty for dipping bread in. Tasty and pretty good deal for the small size we ordered. Churrasco Arriero - Skirt steak. It came medium-well done. A little chewy but it was still good and flavorful. Not a fan of the dipping sauce though - mango salsa? Didn't really go with the steak. Tabla De Quesos Y Embutidos - Assorted cheeses and cured meat. It was alright. Chorizo and potatos - I forgot the dish name and it's not listed here. The chorizo and little diced potato pieces were equally tasty. I want more! Overall pretty good food and I would definitely come back another time to check out the many other menu items and sangria flavors.,1
1697,6,4,9/1/2013,"Great tapas place. Check out the pulpo a la gallego, really good. Usually crowded. Service is very good as well (nice staff). Good spot in the east village.",1
2283,6,4,8/29/2013,"It was a great experience. The bartender was fun to talk with, she said she was from Zaragoza and very cool. She recommended me great drinks. The waitresses were very cool and you can have tons of fun with. The food was ok. The environment was wonderful!",1
2284,6,4,8/22/2013,"I really like this place, it has a very casual and homey feel inside. My friends and I were seated at a table for 8, near the flamenco area (which I'll get to later!). Decor and service were great, so I don't have any complaints about that. We tried both the mango sangria and the blueberry champagne sangria; both were great. Not heavy on the alcohol side, and the fruitiness definitely came through. The tapas were great. Recommendations from our list were the chorizo a la plancha, gambas al ajillo, albondiguillas estofadas, and any of the croquettes. All of the food was pretty good, but prepared to order at least 2 or 3 plates per person; this is a tapas restaurant after all. The real reason we came on this Thursday was for the flamenco. It was a lot of fun to watch, mesmerizing at times with great music. It's definitely not an experience you can normally get. All in all, it's a fun place to go if you're in the mood for tapas, and definitely one of the better tapas restaurants I've been to. They don't have traditional jamon iberico, however, which is something I always look for at a tapas place, but otherwise, it's certainly good, and cheaper than many other tapas places out there.",1
2285,6,4,8/22/2013,"Enjoyed my meal here food was 3.5 star but our waitress was awesome so I bump it up to 4 stars We came here on a tuesday for their happy hour. Their sangria is truely delicious as the reviews suggested. Really liked the red one and the mango sangria is also very good, but a bit too light/sweet for me We got the Churrasio Arriero which is steak served with red peppers on the side. This one was just ok. The steak could be a bit more tender Patatas Bravas: potatoes in this spicy ketchup. Good but nothing special Croqutas De Jamon: Ham croquette. My favorite of the night. Delicious we also got an order of the mix seafood, forgot the name, it was just all right Overall, a very pleasant experience. The waitress, this African American lady, Â was super sweet, nice and professional. She made the whole experience awesome. Will definitely be back again.",1
2286,6,3,8/21/2013,"Go here for tapas if you can't find another spot and must have tapas or the location is extremely convenient. We ordered their mango sangria and were underwhelmed. For food, we had the croquetas de pollo, skirt steak, mussels in avo sauce, and patatas bravas. None of them were bad but nothing was the best or close to best rendition of anything I've ever eaten. The avo sauce with bread and the skirt steak were probably the highlights of the meal. I make better croquetas at home and the patatas bravas were no where near as delicious as my old favorite, Mercat. The waitstaff was mildly attentive but not up to NYC caliber. I reserved on open table and honored my reservation. Nai marked me as no-show even though I showed up exactly on time. Open table resolved the issue but it was just a bummer that I had to deal with that. No other of the 39+ restaurants I've reserved through open table have ever done this to me so I'm rounding Nai down to 3 stars.",1
2287,6,4,8/20/2013,"I was in desperate need of a last-minute Friday night dinner reservation for 9 people. I was surprised to see that Nai still had availability on such short notice, so I went ahead and made the booking. Service: 5 Food 3.5 The service here was absolutely phenomenal! I had called several times to change the reservation and they never gave me a hard time. Our waitress was friendly, made great recommendations, and checked in on us regularly. She encouraged us to try a different flavor of sangria ($25 pitchers, yes pleasee), and even offered to replace it if we didn't end up liking it (which wasn't an issue since it was delicious). The food was great, don't get me wrong. The meatballs were bomb, the assorted croquettes were flavorful and flaky, and I definitely recommend the skirt steak. The patatas bravas were a bit too mealy (the potato chunks were just too big to get crispy), so you should opt for the patatas alioli instead. However, nothing stood out or wow-ed me in particular. All in all it was a fantastic experience. The layout and seating was not cramped, the ambiance was warm and friendly, and I would certainly recommend this place for anyone planning larger group dinners.",1
2288,6,3,8/16/2013,"This place is a reasonably priced tapas bar in East Village that draws crowds with its cheap sangria and weekend flamenco dancing. Alas, we missed the flamenco. Our reservations were too early in the evening but we did enjoy some of that cheap sangria. I feel like we must've ordered the majority of the menu, but the one takeaway was the Pulpo a la Gallega was very very good. Super fork-tender, not at all chewy, I don't think I've ever had octopus that good and at much more esteemed restaurants. In fact, the octopus would probably be the only reason for my return to Nai Tapas. The rest of the food was pretty unmemorable, your standard patatas bravas and croquetas. The Mejillones RÃ­as Baixas were the smallest, most pitiful mussels I have ever seen, but came steeped in the most fragrant garlic / white wine sauce. Much bread-dipping ensues. Anyways, it's an affordable tapas restaurant with decent food, and I'm sure if you're on your third glass of sangria and watching a lively Flamenco performance 2 feet in front of you it's a damn good time.",1
2289,6,3,8/11/2013,"Nai Tapas had solid food in terms of quality, but unfortunately re-affirms my belief that tapas restaurants that are too into the idea of 'tapas' never feed you enough... When we went, there was no flamenco performance, so perhaps we missed out on a key part of the Nai experience. That being said, we asked the waiter for recommendations and consequently got what he thought were the 2-3 best dishes in every major food category. The food was all tasty...but somehow, even with only 3 of us, we only got a small bite of every dish that came by. If you want an 'authentic' experience, perhaps with flamenco, then Nai might be worth considering. If you want a filling, hearty meal though, perhaps consider somewhere else...",1
2290,6,5,8/11/2013,Excellent service and food. My gf and I went there and it was a nice surprise. Great sangria and the tapas was really good.,1
2291,6,5,8/8/2013,"I had a blast at this place! I have reserved through open table for my friend's bachelorette party (4 ppl) at 7 on a Sat night and asked to be right in front of the flamenco performance. Around 2pm of the day I received a confirmation call for the reservation. Nice! So as all of us know that girls take a while to get ready and of course we were late about 20 min. (But I did call around 6:30 to let them know we are running late...the person on the phone was nice about it) When we got there our table was already waiting for us and not a minute wasted we were seated. The portion of the plate was small and if you choose the tapa size instead of the regular size, it's basically 3 pieces to 6 pieces. Even tough it makes a bit harder to split between 4 ppl but our waitress, Jenn, who is awesome by the way would put in one extra for us. I'm not expert on authentic tapas food but I enjoyed our food. We kept the sangria coming and many glasses and cheers were raised. It can be loud but that's expected at this kind of place. So if you are looking to pour your heart out to your date please go somewhere else. The flamenco was spectacular! I never seen one before but to have the opportunity to watch it so closely was sensational. The rhythm and passion coming through the dance is so vibrant and you just want to get up and dance with them. Our super Â amazing waitress secretly put in a request for a shout out for the bride-to-be and they invited her to the dance floor! She was so exhilarated to have the whole restaurant cheering for her while she danced and it was the best highlight of her night! Overall, great service, great ppl, great food and it's priceless when your good friend was kissing goodbye her single hood with a loud bang!",1
2292,6,4,8/7/2013,"My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed this place. We had a reservation and had to wait around 30 minutes. We had just arrived to the restaurant when the manager said our table would be ready in 2 minutes. Just as the 2 minute mark was up, 2 horribly snippy females strut in the door right past us and look at the open table and go ""I see our high top awaiting us!!!!!"" and walk right over. The manager was extremely friendly and apologized for the rudeness of the girls, offered us a free pitcher of sangria and a spot at the bar while we waited. We were in no hurry so this was fine for us. The place was pleasantly crowded with a good atmosphere (Friday night around 9pm). We had trouble picking out things on the menu cause everything seemed appetizing. We ended up going with the garlic shrimp, chicken croquettes, beef empanadas, meatballs in brandy sauce, and the patatas aoili. Everything was amazing! We were happy with every single dish and it was very difficult to pick our favorite. Great staff and atmosphere, and good food! I'll definitely come back sometime.",1
2293,6,5,8/6/2013,"Ever since I went to Barcelona, I've been on a search for a Spanish omelette as good as the one I had there. Nai Tapas is as close as you can get! All the tapas that we tried were excellent. I really think you can't go wrong with anything you order here. Not to mention the prices are so reasonable! I came with a group of 3, we ordered 5 or 6 tapas, a salad, and a pitcher of sangria, and the bill only came out to $88! That's pretty freaking awesome if you ask me. The atmosphere is also really nice and cozy, it felt like being in Spain. Bonus - on Thursdays & Saturdays they have a flamenco show which is really cool and entertaining to watch. Also, it was a friends birthday, and they bring all the birthday people to the stage area and give them a quick flamenco lesson - awesome!",1
2294,6,5,7/31/2013,i cant stop coming to this tapas bar! certified best meatballs i've ever had in my life! and the sangria is awesome! not watered down or too strong...great date night place with entertainment!,1
2295,6,3,7/31/2013,"I wish I was as impressed with the food as I was with the service. I had read great reviews on Nai Tapas and I had wanted to try it for a while now. It was friday night, my friend had just come back from her Europe trip and I had lot to catch up wit her. I was looking for a quiet place with happy hour drinks, small bites and good service. We arrived there at 6:30 pm, we were seated right away even though we were still waiting for one more person to arrive. Our waiter was charming and had great marketing skills. We ordered a pitcher of mango sangria. This was our first time trying mango sangria, we didn't know what to expect. But the waiter gave a big go ahead for it. The drink was good, wasn't something i would drink on regular basis, but for a warm weather it was refreshing.We ordered 6-7 tapas dishes. Being a fish lover, i really enjoyed my Sardines. They were fresh and cooked to the right amount. Patatas Bravas, Chicken Croquetes, Seafood Paella, Oxtail were few of the other dishes we ordered. I didn't try the oxtail, but my friends really enjoyed it. The other dishes were just ok, was edible but not delicious . I was a lil dissapointed with our paella. I imagined a paella from my barcelona trip with lot fo shrimps, muscles, squids and clams. But for 17 bucks, the portion was really really small, it literally had 3 pieces of seafood and 4 spoons of rice. Since our waitor kept asking us how everything was, i gave him an honest review for the paella. He took my review very well, promised to pass on the comment to the chef and even gave us a small discount for the paella. We ended the meal with coconut Flan. I liked it.",1
2296,6,4,7/30/2013,"Nai Tapas is awesome. Â Great service, wonderful food, totally priced affordable, and great sangria. Â Do you need anything else? Â The only reason why I'm not giving it a 5-star rating is because I think Alta and Casa Mono are better, but from a value perspective, this place rocks! Â I highly recommend the establishment - be sure to book your reservations in advance as this place usually sells out.",1
2297,6,3,7/29/2013,"I've had a lot of fun at this place. I came with a large group of about 8 or so and it was a free-flowing party of tapas and delicious sangrias and nobody was wanting for anything. Afterwards, they played flamenco music, so a few of us got going on the dance floor. It's super tiny and not fancy at all, but I have really great memories in this place.",1
2298,6,4,7/29/2013,"Love this place. Tapas in the city can get very expensive very quickly but this is not one of them. Some of the best tasting tapas items I've ever had, not to mention their Sangria is off the charts. It's on the smaller side so on a Friday or Saturday night there can be a bit of a wait, but hey it's Manhattan what do you expect. Come during the week and you'll probably be seated immediately. And enjoy.",1
2299,6,5,7/28/2013,"I love this place. Food is great, inexpensive and the flamenco really entertaining.",1
2300,6,5,7/25/2013,"Solid, authentic spanish tapas. Nothing crazy or fancy, just good food. Â And great waiters.",1
2301,6,4,7/22/2013,"Spent this past Saturday night at this wonderful little place celebrating my wife's birthday along with 15 friends/family. The staff was fantastic. Service was top notch and food was great. We opted for price fixed menu which included a nice cross section of great delights along with various different flavored sangrias. The mango flavor was a favorite. The chicken croquets were great along with the spicy cheese squares, the sausages, curry chicken and meatballs. The entertainment was GREAT. The performers were gracious and extremely talented. The music and dancing were both top notch. I rarely offer reviews, however the combination of GREAT and caring management along with an equally up to the task staff and wonderful entertainment made this night truly one that we will remember with smiles for a long time to come. Anyone debating of where to go for a great evening filled with something different, the debate is over.... this is the place.",1
2302,6,4,7/22/2013,"Went with a group of girls for a fun night out. It's the perfect atmosphere to sit, drink sangria and try some tapas! We absolutely loved the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria!",1
2303,6,5,7/21/2013,"This is my favorite Tapas place in the city. My best friend and I love going to Tapas bars and we come here at least twice a month. I have yet to had a tapa that wasn't good and they sangria is amazing. They have so many different flavors. My favorites are the red sangria and the blueberry/pomegranate/champagne sangria. And on Thursdays and Saturdays, they have flamenco dancers. I have yet to go then, because I never plan enough in advance, but I'm hoping to go soon. I highly recommend checking this place out. You won't be disappointed.",1
2304,6,2,7/20/2013,"I really do not understand how this place has gotten so many good reviews on here or open table, how I originally found out about this place. Our waiter rushed us through our meal from the moment we sat down. Mussels were not good- half of them did not open and the rest were un-fresh and tasted bad. The ""spicy broth"" they were in was oily. When I told the waiter about the mussels and tried to send them back he took the dish and just walked away. We were charged for them... Egg omelette was very bland. Bathroom was filthy, smelled,hot and floor was VERY unclean. I was extremely disappointed by the poor service and food. I would not go back here. The placed was filled with younger people and young couples on dates.. maybe they just don't know any better.",1
2305,6,4,7/14/2013,"Service was great, Mango Sangria was awesome, a tad on the loud side but after a few glasses of Sangria, you'll be just as loud. The mussels were cooked perfectly and the price for two after a couple of hours made me very happy. Â I highly recommend this place.",1
2306,6,4,7/12/2013,"Came here for my birthday dinner an had a great time. Not sure if the food tasted so good because of all the sangria we drank lol but I absolutely loved the meatballs patatas bravas, and beef empanadas! I would definitely go back.",1
2307,6,4,7/10/2013,"I love this place, their mango sangria was a refreshing kick to the summer heat. The dishes are usually pretty tasty, the shrimp with garlic was my favorite. The left over sauce was great to dip the bread with. However, the mussels this time had a weird smell to it. Probably shouldn't be ordering shellfish during hot summer months.",1
2308,6,4,7/8/2013,"The tapas here are pretty awesome. I'm not sure if it is awesome because they tasted good, or because the servings were so small that everything tasted good. I'm pretty sure it was a mixture of both that made the food taste good. I ordered 5 plates of items that were most popular and of items that looked good on Yelp photos. I shared it with a friend and thoroughly enjoyed every small bite. Their Flamenco show was awesome! If you come here, make sure you make a reservation for the show! It really made my night. The dancers were so talented! They also have pitchers of sangria, loved that as well! Overall, the experience was awesome but thats because a show came with my dinner.",1
2309,6,2,7/2/2013,"Peeps must be too drunk from the sangria to taste the food here! Yes, it's a fun place. Yes, I was tipsy from the awesomely cheap sangria deal. Yes, I was PUMPED that they had olives stuffed with anchovies-- literally, that's all I snacked on when I was in Spain and the Basque Country a few years ago. Excitement ended at the olives. The octopus, which came highly recommended from our waiter, was overcooked, mushy, and badly seasoned. Also unimpressed by the fish dishes (all overcooked) and asparagus (mushy too). Everything else was mediocre. The service was awesome and they did take a couple items off the bill because we were disappointed. But still, there are tapas places popping up all over Manhattan so I'd really only come back for the sangria and flamenco...",1
2310,6,4,6/29/2013,"Went to Nai for my birthday with 13 people. They could not have been more accommodating, responsive and helpful. The experience was well beyond expectations and I will definitely be back. In fact, I bet all of my 12 guests will go back on their own. The Flamenco is not cheesy, as some might think. It's a real surprise in an otherwise mundane city of restaurants with no oomph. What to order... Gambas Ajillo - shrimp in garlic sauce - superb! Croquetas De Jamon - Serrano Ham croquetttes - a very nice dish! Croquetas De Pollo - chicken croquettes Albondiguillas - meatballs in brandy sauce- so delicious! Patatas Alioli - potato in creamy garlic sauce Patatas Bravas - potato in spicy tomato sauce Tortilla Espanola - Spanish omelet Churrasco - skirt steak sauteed with spicy cherry peppers and garlic Chorizo Plancha- grilled Spanish sausage Bacalao Frito. - fresh cod loin lightly fried.",1
2311,6,5,6/24/2013,"Great service. Our waiter was really helpful and funny. He gave us some great suggestions for tapas and all of them were delicious. The sangria there is also quite amazing. We got pitchers of the mango and the blueberry champagne sangria, which definitely satiated our sangria craving. I will definitely be going back soon!",1
2312,6,4,6/23/2013,"This small tapas bar in the E. village serves up some pretty tasty food. Â You walk in, and it looks exactly like a bar with a full bar to your left and various tables surrounding. Â The workers were all nice and friendly, Â The pitcher of sangria was only $20 and you have 4 or 5 different flavors to choose from, and best of all it was a full pitcher. Â We tried around 6 or 7 things, all were good. Â Definitely a solid place if you are in the mood for some tapas and cheap drinks.",1
2313,6,3,6/22/2013,"So these are the times you wish the Yelp stars can be categorized. Â First time to Nai this week and it is a really fun place - great young crowd, super-nice/responsive/helpful wait staff, great assortment on the menu, and very decent prices for food and drink. 5 stars for all of that. Â Lots of birthday dinners going on so certainly a fun place to come with a crowd. Â  My only disappointment came with the tapas itself....much of it simply average...definitely not bad...but just average. Â Would have like to seen a bit more creatively & sophistication with the construction of each dish instead of layers simply being slapped together. Â All the food came quickly so perhaps that was the trade-off. Â  Likely to return but my expectations have been adjusted.",1
2314,6,4,6/14/2013,Great place to eat! Â The menu covers a wide range of food (all good). Â The service was great and the location is cozy. Â I can not wait to go back.,1
2315,6,5,6/11/2013,"Came here on a Friday night for happy hour with 2 of my friends. We got a half pitcher of sangria for $10 and 6 tapas to share, and they were fantastic! All tapas were fresh and yummy and the drink was great and stronger than I expected! We got here before 7pm when it was fairly empty, but it was a full house by 9pm. The service was one of the best I've had in the city for its price, and it was consistent throughout the night despite the growing crowd. It's a great spot to chill with a small group. I shall be back again soon!",1
2316,6,5,6/10/2013,"Fantastic service, friendly bartenders, great food and dynamite sangria's. Thursday night they had flamenco dancers that were just awesome. Definitely a regular now.",1
2317,6,4,6/6/2013,"3.5 Â or 4....the staff/service was outstanding, the group we went with all loved the food and we had a great night so 4 it is :) no true liquour which was very sad for the frozen margarita or mojito lover in me ..just beer wine and sangria (delicious and perfectly spiked!!) awesome tapas selections and each one we ordered was a hit! the waitress (jenn i believe) was very helpful! here goes: Churrasco Arriero - steak was perfectly cooked, very juicy and tender with light sauce, enough meat to share for at least 3 people Gambas En Salsa Verde - shrimps were a little too cooked for my liking but the sauce was amazing; good for sharing with like 2-3 Mejillones RÃ­as Baixas - all the mussels had some meats in them so that's a relief and it was tasty, good enough to share with at least 3-4 people Patatas Alioli - the big hit of the night in my opinion...very very garlicy but perfectly cooked potatoes! shareable for like 2-3 SalpicÃ³n De Marisco - this is that one tapa that you get and dont share because you wanna taste it all! so refreshing and tasty.",1
2318,6,4,6/3/2013,Yum. Great food and the sangria.... ay!,1
2319,6,5,5/26/2013,"Love this place! The atmosphere, service, and the food were wonderful. Double points for the flamenco dancers who danced so amazingly. I would definitely check this place out :)",1
1751,6,4,5/23/2013,"The Good: - AMAZING atmosphere - Book early/reserve for a table in front of the Flamenco dancing. They have a live show every Thursday and Saturday! - I will be coming back and bringing vistors for the spectacular show. I paid a lot of money in Spain and this was equal if not better. And it's FREE with dinner! - Try the 'Gambas Al Ajillo' - shrimp in garlic sauce from the tapas menu. - The host and waiter were both INCREDIBLY sweet and helpful with the menu and explaining the intracacies of the dishes. The Bad: - Very disappointing food! - I did not enjoy the garlic potato dish - doused in mayonnaise nor the tuna empandillas, however, I did not try enough of the menu The Details: This place is VERY loud if you come for Flamenco dancing (9 - 10 PM on Saturdays at least) so sit further back if you want to have a conversation. But that's Flamenco for you - the heel stomping is incredibly loud.",1
2320,6,4,5/21/2013,"Great food, especially the croquetas! Fast and good service. Good value for money. Lively atmosphere, although a bit loud if you're planning on talking to your company the entire time. Only thing I'm annoyed at is the restaurant told Open Table that I did not honour the reservation, which my party and I obviously did.",1
2321,6,3,5/18/2013,"No one was by the door to accommodate new customers. We had to wait and wait until someone acknowledge us. The waitress explained the menu to us basically the whole menu to her was good. Anyways we got the Pan tumaca which was like a bread toast topped with serrano ham & manchego cheese. : this didn't turn out as I expected it to be, it didn't work with one another especially the cheese. Beef empanadas, they called the turnover: I always call for this just to be on the safe side whenever I come to a Spanish restaurant. The meatballs: again a must have in case the other tapas is no good. Pulpo A La Gallega which was octopus sprinkled with sea salt and sweet paprika. This dish was too salty. Pollo Al Ajillo chicken with potatoes in garlic sauce. The chicken was too dry. I also tried their mango sangria. Next time I won't go exploring other sangria. Red sangria is always the way to go. Service was fluent.",1
2322,6,5,5/10/2013,"Truly an awesome brunch experience. Â Beautiful paintings, great latin music, awesome sangria (multiple choices), great food, and excellent service. Â I must admin that we were one of 3 tables that were there at the time, so I can't speak to the service when it's busy. Â But we had a great experience all around. We tried the following: - Churrasco Arriero - Gambas Al Ajillo (Shrimp in Garlic Sauce) - Pulpo A La Gallega (Octopus in Olive Oil) - Patatas Bravas (their version of home fries) - Stuffed peppers - Another shrimp dish (can't recall) - Two sangrias (red and peach/mango) And all were very very tasty! Â Within those, the must-tries were definitely the Churrsasco, Shrimp, and Patatas Bravas. Â But they were all good! I would definitely recommend!",1
2323,6,5,5/7/2013,Great service and great food! :),1
2324,6,5,4/14/2013,"We tried to go for dinner and the show, but the early seating (8:00PM) was full. Â Instead we went for the 10:00 PM Flamenco show on Saturday. Â Having just come from a very big dinner, we did not order a meal. Â However, we soon regretted being so full as the entrees around us (and the reaction of the other patrons to the food) looked great. Â  The show was fantastic and the music and dancing were both terrific. Â I wish the sound system was a bit better. Â We were literally in front of the musicians and sometimes it was hard to hear the vocals and acoustic guitars. Â That said, it was a great show; very passionate dancing and music. The service was polite and efficient. Â We literally ordered a club soda and coffee, but the waiter was all smiles and attentive. Â The check was about $6.00, with no cover, so we tipped $20.00 on top of it because we had taken a table for the whole show. We will definitely be back to eat dinner",1
2069,6,4,4/14/2013,"Happy hour before 7pm!!! :) We got half pitcher of Sangria for 10 dollars.. Their most popular sangria is the red sangria.. I will recommend getting that because you will get more ""alcohol"" compare to the tropical/mango or other fruit taste.. And I personally prefer red sangria compare to the white sangria.. I came here on a thursday night at 6pm.. I guess it's the day before good friday.. The restaurant was fully book and we can only get seated at the bar.. It's ok because the bartender lady was really friendly.. She recommend us all the ""good stuff"".. The tapas (""good stuff"") - Patatas Alioli potatoes basted in a creamy garlic alioli sauce: It's basically just potato with garlic sauce.. I would recommend to order this as a tapas dish but not a bigger portion because it's pretty filling after a few pieces.. - Clams in spicy sauce.. We dip the complementary bread into the spicy sauce.. We both love spicy food.. The clams is pretty good and I like it because it's not ""burning"" spicy but you get to taste the flavor I have to be honest.. I was so hungry that I ate most of the food and I kinda forgot what we ordered.. - something with cheese at the back of the menu.. It's one of my favorite.. I am wondering how can I forget.. - some spicy chicken.. I will not comment much on it.. since all I remember was DELICIOUS.. I have to say Nai Tapas Bar is one of the best tapas place I have ever had.. Cheap & Delicious + friendly waiter + good & cheap sangria!! I will return again!",1
2325,6,5,4/14/2013,"This is place is great. The food is really good. We got 4 tapas for 2 people. The tapas did not come all together but one after the other one. I don't know if they do this on purpose, but it improved the experience a lot. I guess it works if you are sharing all the tapas. If you are not sharing, you might end up eating at different times. We got the following: Gambas En Salsa Verde: delicious and good size. Croquetas De Bacalao: tasty, but somehow small. Only 3 little pieces. Patatas Bravas: Good amount of potatoes. Pulpo A La Gallega: Nice ending to a great dinner. Along all this food, you get (unlimited?) amount of bread will olive oil. The waiter tried to convince us to order one more tapa at the beginning, but these 4 tapas + half a pitcher of sangria (with red wine) was the perfect amount of food. At least for us two. Service is also really good. An on top of this, if you go say a Saturday around 8.30 or 10.30, you get a flamenco show. Pretty entertaining. I wouldn't go there for my birthday, unless prepared to dance flamenco. The place is a little pricey, but taking into account that you get a show and good food, it worth the experience. I'm glad my girlfriend took me here, hehe.",1
2326,6,4,4/10/2013,"Been to this place twice and it keeps me wanting more. The mussels, anything chorizo, and croquetas are delicious. Service has always been pretty good and the beer selection is what is to be expected of a Spanish place (Estrella). Only had the Sangria once and that was during happy hour (pitcher seemed watered downed). I must come on a Thursday or Saturday - I believe they have flamenco dancing.",1
2327,6,4,4/9/2013,"My friend was visiting from SF and wanted tapas - though I've never been to Nai, I made a reservations and was glad that I chose this place. Though I didn't need the reservation (the place is pretty empty on a Tuesday night at 7 pm), I've been turned away during the weekend before, so I didn't want a repeat of that. We ordered: Gambas Al Ajillo - really flavorful, garlicky shrimp Bacalao Frito - fried cod, not super heavy, like fried fish is normally Pimientos De Piquillo Rellenos - peppers stuffed with cod - really tasty, one of my favorites of the evening Patatas Alioli - potatoes with spicy mayo - good, nothing unexpected Empanadillas De Atun - also one of my favorites for the evening, tuna stuffed empanadas, really flavorful and LOTS of sangria The food was amazing - I liked everything that we ordered. The sangria was also really good, they had a lot of different types (we tried all) but I think my favorite was still the classic red sangria. The bartender was really friendly and helpful - she made a bunch of suggestions and wasn't pushy at all. I'll definitely come back when I'm in the mood for tapas again!",1
2328,6,3,4/8/2013,"Atmosphere 3.5 Decor 3.5 Food 3.5 Service 4 So I wanted to get Tapas, and this was the only place I could make last minute reservations for. I arrived to dinner 10 minutes late for my reservation, and my friend was already there. They wouldn't seat him yet, because the whole party had to be here before they seat you (I understand that, that's pretty normal). But when I arrived, no one came to help us out, and when someone came, he helped out this couple that had just walked in right past us and had an 8:45 reservation, and then the server walked away...we waited for a whole 15 minute before someone came and seated us. After we were seated, the service got much better. The servers were really helpful in answering our questions, and helping us make our selections. Further more, my phone was out of batteries, and my friend had a charger, so we asked them if they could charge my phone. They were really friendly about it, and looked for a free outlet for me without a fuss :) The decor of this place is quite cute. Very rustic with wooden tables. Beware though, the wooden tables (at least mine) sloped downwards, so first, my eating utensils rolled in the napkin rolled on the floor, I picked it up, and put it on the table to get the utensils out so I can put the napkin on my lap, and the fork and knife fell on the floor -- how embarrassing. There was not a great selection of tapas, it was someone limited. A lot of seafood, very little meat. We ordered a churrizo, the garlic shrimp which is meant to be good, the octopus, the asparagus stuffed with anchovies and the meatballs in brandy sauce. All in all, food was above average. It tasted good, food was well seasoned, but nothing really wowed me, or left me wanting more. The sangria was great though, we had the red sangria. I like my sangria with a lot of fruits, this one just had a few slices of apple. As a summary, this place is OK . Probably a solid 3.5. I would not be able to give it a 4 though.",1
2329,6,3,4/7/2013,"Came here after reading Yelpers reviews. It was Friday night, my friend used Open Table to make her reservation. Got there before the end of Happy Hour (Pitcher Sangria special). Haven't seen my friend for a while, started to chit-chat. The waiter came over three times to confirmed our reservation, asked us when we're ready to order. So finally we gotten to order from the menu, which had quite a big selection. We ordered 4 tapas dishes to try, but the waiter said we should get one more dish to be full. Taste wise it was okay, wasn't all too special. The skirt steak came out a bit tough, the octopus was tender yet kind of bland. My friend liked the Proscuitto wrap goat cheese ball a lot, too filling for my taste though. Price wise, was expected for East Village restaurants.",1
2330,6,5,4/5/2013,"Love, Love, Love, this restaurant! The food is amazing and the wait staff is equally as wonderful. Â We have been here a number of times and have never had a bad experience. Â Their garlic shrimp is perfectly cooked and tasty. Â Their ham and cheese croquettes are one of my favorite things to eat here. Â The flamenco shows are awesome. Â Oh, and the drinks are priced well and are tasty but pack a punch. Â Can't wait to go back!",1
2331,6,4,4/3/2013,"Very good authentic tapas served in a cool relaxed atmosphere. Â Prices are reasonable and drink selection is solid, from spanish beers ive never tried before to commendable sangria served from three barrels set behind the bar. A gimmick, yes, but its a nice touch and it works. Â Nice wine selection as well. Â All told, nice place to go with a date or with friends any day of the week.",1
2332,6,4,4/2/2013,"They are only losing a star due to the fact that even though we booked, we still waited 45min for a table. I am new to NYC so maybe this is normal? Other than that, once we had our table, it was amazing! The waitress did a great job recommending food items and they were all delicious. As for the sparlking white wine Sangria, I have no words. The staff were all really friendly and the place has a buzzing, cozy atmosphere. I definitely recommend it...I am now craving Tapas just from writing this review!",1
2333,6,5,4/2/2013,"Nice selection, great service and tasty food. Can't complain! Chorizo anything rocks. I can't wait to go back again!",1
2334,6,4,3/30/2013,"This might be my new favorite tapas place. The garlic and shrimp, white asparagus, and mussels were delicious and I couldn't get enough of the mango sangria. But I didn't like the goat cheese with ham - goat cheese is tasty by itself, it doesn't need to be deep fried. The flamenco dancers and musicians were really talented and fun to watch. I liked how they would grab everyone's attention to watch the dancers and then play more quietly so people could converse. The atmosphere is very intimate so bring a date!",1
2335,6,4,3/21/2013,"The waitress was patient and willing to educate us about a cuisine that we didn't know very much about. She seemed genuinely interested in making sure we had a good experience. The ""house red"" was on special for happy hour and it was a good value. Would happily return. There are tapas left to try.",1
2336,6,5,3/20/2013,"Absolutely wonderful! Great bottle of wine! Amazing Tapas! We had: Salteado de gambas, Mejillones rellenos, Pelotollas de queso de cabra, Esparragos rellenos, Churrasco arriero, Solomillo a la naranja! All delightful! Service was great!!",1
2337,6,5,3/12/2013,"I came here for my birthday. The tapas were pretty good and the waitress was very helpful in picking out the tapas to try as well. We had the patatas bravas, beef empanadas, Chorizo A La Plancha, Tabla De Jamon Y Queso, and Croquetas De Pollo. We also had a pitcher of mango sangria to go along with it. All of it was good They also added a chocolate cake with a candle because it was my birthday! Great Service!",1
2338,6,5,3/11/2013,"I spent 6 months in Barcelona during college, and ever since have craved tapas and sangria to a dangerous extent. Â Dangerous because usually tapas in the United States in no way resemble anything I ate in Spain, meanwhile they cost 1.5-2 times as much as they should. Â  Thankfully, Nai Tapas is both authentic and affordable, and I am eternally grateful to my friend Aron for choosing this place for this birthday dinner. Â The table got multiple pitchers of sangria, and the classic and mango flavors were to die for. Â The pomegranate blueberry was pretty good too, but the others overshadowed it. Â Also, this sangria actually packs a punch and is not just fruit and ice, so beware! Â  I would recommend pairing up with someone at your table with similar tastes, because you don't want to be passing plates to an entire table, it's easier to just split a bunch of stuff. Â As for Â my boyfriend and I, we wanted the authentic, weird-sounding tapas for that Catalan experience. Â  So. Â We got the escargot in garlic sauce, blood sausage, a raciÃ³n (big order) of patatas bravas, octopus, and olives stuffed with anchovies. Â The escargot was delectable (I mean what isn't in garlic and oil??), the blood sausage was amazing; great flavor and presentation, the patatas bravas were so authentic and crispy, it really brought me back to drinking Estrella Damm in the middle of the day and eating in PlaÃ§a Reial. Â The olives were good, but they weren't what I remembered, so I'll give them a pass next time. Â Really the crowning jewel was the tender, flavorful pulpo a la gallega. Â There is no faking this dish; if the octopus isn't fresh, it will be terribly obvious because there is no sauce or other stuff to cover it up. Â Our waiter informed us the dish was so good because they only imported Spanish, cold-water octopus, as opposed to South Pacific octopus. Â Kudos to Nai for doing it right. Â  I can't wait to come back and try some croquetas and tortilla! Â  We also enjoyed the flamenco performance, which was surprisingly authentic as well. Â The only thing is it made conversation difficult since it's pretty loud, but I wasn't complaining.",1
2339,6,5,3/10/2013,"Came here for a merienda of sorts, on a Sunday afternoon (around 4:00). GREAT SERVICE, which I think is still the case, even when we're not the only patrons in the restaurant. The food was absolutely amazing. We ordered the bacalao, piquillo peppers stuffed with salted cod, fried goat cheese and prosciutto on toast and calamari in its own ink, and everything tasted to perfection! The flavor was rich but not overbearing (as should be the case with tapas), the quantity was great (we ordered for 7 people), the texture of everything was just right! We also ordered pitchers of the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria, which I definitely recommend. No complaints here! Will definitely return!",1
2340,6,4,3/9/2013,"They have six types of sangria! Â The blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria was delicious and refreshing. Â The chorizo a la rioja and pan tumaca were great. Â The tortilla espanola and stuffed peppers were done well, but bland. Â The pulpo a la gallega was decent. Â Service was warm and friendly. I will go back to try the other sangria flavors and other tapas on the menu.",1
2341,6,3,3/3/2013,"The quality of food has declined since my last visit. The octopus was too soft and mushy. The spanish omelet was overcooked and I couldn't even finish it because it was so dry. The potatoes with aioli was good. The other dishes I had were not memorable. And skip the chocolate cake. The wine-soaked pear was good, but nothing special. Sucks that I have to find a new go-to tapas place with consistent quality.",1
2342,6,3,3/2/2013,"The tapas were okay, and would have been much better with some minor changes. I thought the patatas bravas were too soft and should have been crispier. The Pan Tumaca would have been much better withOUT the spicy tomato paste spread on the buttered toasted bread. The Churrasco Arriero - skirt steak was the best and the Gambas Al Ajillo wasn't bad. However, our sangria was watered down. On another note, we came here on a Thursday evening and it was ridiculously loud because of live performers and dancers. We were seated near the front and couldn't see the performers and just heard lots of 'clacking' from the dancers' finger cymbals. They also appeared to be understaffed, with one waiter and 2 bus boys and service was really slow.",1
2343,6,5,3/2/2013,"Yummyyyy tapas!! 4 people - 9 tapas dishes. Happy hour from 5-7, $20 pitchers of sangria. Who could ask for anything else? Mussels - They were so succulent and moist. The broth the mussels were cooked in had such an intense briney flavor. Typically I'm not a fan of mussels but cooked this way I would order 2 servings of it. I actually ended up taking the mussels out and putting it on the bread after dipping it in the broth. Definitely something I would order again next time I visit. Escargot - There were only about 6 pieces of snail but the garlic sauce the escargot was cooked it - was absolutely divine. If it wasn't so embarrassing I would have totally licked the garlic off the plate. Pairing the garlic with the bread definitely made it all the while worth it. Definitely something I would order again as well. Ham croquettes - It's like a higher level of mozzarella sticks...but even better. There weren't that much ham inside the croquettes but it was so hot and melty delicious you can't help but go for a second piece. That cheese is so good. Goat cheese with serrano ham, tomato and toast - This was definitely the prettiest tapas plate of the whole evening. I'm not a fan of goat cheese but the combination between the ham, toast and tomato helped cut down the goat cheese flavor. Not a fan of the goat cheese but definitely a tapas dish to try if it's your first time. Chorizo with onions - Who doesn't love chorizo? This dish is better than the chorizo with fried potato because there's more of it. The carmalized onions cut the salty spiciness of the chorizo with the sweet greasy onion taste. I also paired the basket bread with the chorizo and it was perfect. Definitely another dish to order on the next visit. Chorizo with fried potato - This tapas dish comes with four pieces. Even though the fried potato did well as a starch base for the oily chorizo there weren't a lot of flavor bursting through it. This is something you can pass - it is something any person at home can make on their own. Patatas Bravas - It is fried potato squares with a spicy drizzle. Every tapas place has it - so is it worth ordering? Probably not. I would like to order another patatas dish though since it is a starchy element (it also helps fill up our stomachs). Shrimp with garlic sauce - One of the best dishes of the night. They gave us around 5-6 pieces of shrimp and the garlic sauce was mouth watering. It had the right amount of garlic undertones but then the broth hits other seafood notes and just elevates the little bowl. This paired with the bread was also a winner. Definitely definitely a reorder! Meatballs - Meh. Meatballs are meatballs. My friend commented that the Ikea meatballs are better. They weren't awful but I would order another tapas plate over this anytime. For sangria, we ordered the mango and blueberry. The mango sangria reminded me of one of the V8 tropical juices but spiked with wine. It was vaguely sweet with a touch of bite (probably from the lemon slices we kept mistaking were orange). The blueberry sangria was stronger and actually didn't really taste like blueberries. It definitely had some hints of sparkling wine because I kept feeling a fizz (probably my buzz). We opted to not order dessert since Venieros was across the street. Our waiter was great - hilarious and picking on us the entire night. We had a ton of fun being sassy with eachother. He gave us this little jar of Hot Mama's Belize pepper jelly that is like a little jar of crack. Just tried it today with fried chicken and it was delicious. (I'm actually going to hunt down a bigger jar of it and smother it with all the fried chicken I can find in the world.) I've never been a fan of tapas since they never seem to fill me up but then again we also had 3 baskets of bread to fill us up and the total ended up being around $35 each with the sangria and it was great. I definitely would love to come back and try their other tapas dishes. FYI - there's only 1 bathroom in the back. ~happy eatings!",1
2344,6,5,3/1/2013,"Spaniard style food is incredible and if it's not in Newark, its often hard to find a good place in the tri-state area. This place blew me away. The tapas are absolutely fantastic. I had one of everything on the menu (having gone two nights back to back I was able to try everything). For desert, I highly recommend flan de coco. It, honestly, is the best flan I have ever had in my life, and if I could eat flan every day, I would (i love it that much!). If you can, definitely reserve a table when they have their Flamenco performances. It was beautiful and made the experience what it was. The bartender is amazing!! She encouraged us to come back the next night to watch the Flamenco dancing. If you can, sit at the bar! I usually hate sitting at bars, but this bar is soo much fun to hang out at b/c of the bartender. She is the best!!",1
2345,6,5,3/1/2013,Great place. Very friendly. Good tapas. Good wine. Great performance of flamenco. Awesome music. I didnt want to leave! :),1
2346,6,4,2/28/2013,"So fun! We arrived at 6:30pm on a Saturday night and the place was packed. We managed to find seats at the bar and the service was great. I'm a huge fan of tapas and having recently been to Barcelona, I had high expectations. Nai met those pretty well! Really large selection of dishes that you can get as tapas or raciones. The night was topped off with an impressive flamenco performance by some very talented and passionate dancers. Seems like it would be a great place to celebrate a birthday - the dancers brought up people who were there for special occasion and taught them some flamenco steps.",1
2347,6,3,2/17/2013,"Cute restaurant but filled with college aged diners. Food was good but not exceptional. Sangria weak. While I had a great night, I dont think I would go out of my way to come here.",1
2348,6,5,2/16/2013,"It's more like 4.5 stars only because the food is sometimes lacking and their sangrias miss a certain pezaz. Â  Overall the atmosphere is fun - especially on flamenco nights! Â The crowd is happy and the waitstaff all do a good job. Â The food is overall very delicious - especially their seafood - SO MUCH YUM! Â  The tapas are a little pricey - that's really the biggest gripe. But hey - they have a nice location in the east village that they need to upkeep. Â  I brought many people here, and they still talk about how great this place is!",1
2349,6,4,2/14/2013,"A fun restaurant, great place to go with a group of friends. Delicious Sangria and wonderful flamenco performance. Its a great place to hang out and have fun. The server brought us another 1/2 a pitcher of sangria for free after to paid to encourage us to stay for the rest of the set. Overall, the service is slow. Not a place to get a quick bite. It is a Spanish restaurant after all.",1
2350,6,4,2/12/2013,Food is great and service is friendly. Prices are definitely fair and the Sangria is awesome. Especially the berry champagne flavor. But on weekend nights they get packed because it is a small space. Even with a reservation it is hard to get seated - they could do a better job at organizing their reservations. But we were more than happy to sit at the bar when the reservation didn't work out. Nice spot!,1
2351,6,5,2/4/2013,"I had an amazing time, the waiter made it all possible, he was delightful and his food recommendations were amazing!!!!!! the only negative thing i have to say is Â the person that first greeted me, was not friendly at first but it all worked out at the end and must definately will go back",1
2352,6,4,2/2/2013,-,1
2353,6,5,2/1/2013,"Love, love, love this place. Â The most authentic tapas place you can find in NYC. Â The tapas are actually things you would eat in Spain, for the most part. Â Some things are better than others. Â Don't miss the albondigas in brandy sauce. Â They are incredible. Native speakers that work there, native chef, etc. Â I love that they have tapas/racion portions just like in Spain, too. Â Prices are fair. Â  A must try!",1
2354,6,4,1/28/2013,"I came to Nai Tapas Bar with a group of about 20 at around 7:15 p.m. on a Saturday. Despite the potential intimidation in numbers during a prime dinner time, that certainly did not show with the Nai staff. They were very accommodating and knowledgeable, and food came out in a timely fashion. The small/large plate option is a great way to try a number of different dishes at a reasonable price, and they were great for sharing. Highlights included the Almejas Diablo (clams in spicy sauce), Caracoles (escargot , already taken out of the shell), Patatas Bravas (potatoes in a house sauce) and the octopus, which wasn't very rubbery like one may usually think when it comes to octopus. Be sure to save your bread to use for the sauces. Two fairly minor nit-pickings in the grand scheme of things deny a 5-star rating from me. While the live music and dancing was quite entertaining and energetic, it was also bit loud, so it was tough to have a conversation with anyone at your table if you were sitting close to it. Also, the staff would combine two small orders into one large order, but since we were in a large group, it got confusing because we didn't know who else ordered the same dish -- it could have been someone 10 people down the line at the other end of the table, and both sides were clueless. If it was a smaller group, combining the two small orders would be a convenient no-brainer. All in all, I'd go again, for sure, and I definitely recommend it.",1
2355,6,2,1/28/2013,"Croquettes are mostly cheese -- can't tase the jamon (and it's not nice jamon either) Meatballs taste like spaghetti marinara Not what I'd expect from a tapas bar The spicy papas bravas are bland and not crisped well Possible I ordered the wrong things, but there weren't as many options for a person who can't eat seafood. I can imagine going here and enjoying trying things with maybe one or two friends, but we had a big group and service was very slow. Took an hour to get my beer.",1
2356,6,4,1/20/2013,"I rarely venture into the East Village, so I would've never known this place even existed had my friend not suggested that we go check it out. The inside is pretty casual and nothing special in terms of decor, but it was packed so it's clearly one of the neighborhood hot spots. From the minute we sat down our waiter (Uniquo I believe), was amazing. We didn't know what we wanted so we allowed him to choose 6 tapas plates for us, and he made perfect selections. I still don't know what they were but they were good :) We also ordered a pitcher of the champagne sangria, and it was delicious and packed a good punch. By the end of the pitcher I felt like we had gotten our money's worth. Â It wasn't just our waiter that was great. Every waiter and busser made rounds and would check on the other tables around to make sure no one needed anything, which I loved. I would say it's probably not the best date spot because it's VERY loud. It's one of those restaurants where they cramp lots of tables together to fit as many people in as possible, so you're sitting in on your neighbors' conversations (and pretty much on their laps), but it's so loud you can't hear what they're saying anyway. I barely heard what my friend was saying from across the table. I would say that based on the excellent food and exceptional service alone, I will definitely make a trip back to Nai in the future.",1
2357,6,4,1/19/2013,"My three friends and I arrived on a Friday night with a 6:45 reservation and the restaurant was surprisingly still fairly empty. By the time we left around 8pm, the place was pretty filled... so come early so you can 1) get seats, and 2) get the happy hour drink special (a pitcher of sangria for $20) before 7pm! Having eaten a late lunch and afternoon dessert, we weren't that hungry so we ordered only six tapas plates for the four of us. We ordered: - Croquetas De JamÃ³n (ham croquettes) - there seemed to be way more cheese than ham... or maybe that was just the one piece I took :-/ - Gambas Al Ajillo (garlic shrimp) - the tapas portion only came with 7 pieces of shrimp, but it was very flavorful and one of my favorites - Calamari in its own ink - pretty bland.. wasn't a big fan - Caracoles (escargot) - buttery and yummy, my other favorite of the night - Patatas Bravas - fried potatoes drizzled with a sauce that resembled spicy mayo - Pulpo A La Gallega (octopus) - also a bit on the bland side We also got a pitcher of the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria, which was VERY light and delicious. It tasted like a fruity soda... my kind of drink! Food and drinks aside, the service here was attentive and excellent. We were seated a few minutes before the end of happy hour (7pm) and our waiter didn't get around to giving us menus until after 7, but he let us order off the happy hour drinks menu anyway. My friend had also bought a slice of cake that she wanted to take home, so they let her store it in the fridge until the end of dinner. 5 stars for service! Overall, it's a good place to go with a small group of people, and I'd definitely return for sangria during happy hour!",1
2358,6,5,1/15/2013,"Best kept secret! My new favorite tapas bar. - Mussels with paprika: a large serving of deliciousness - Hangar steak: tender and cooked well. Even the small portion is nicely sized! - Coquettes with ham: a solid croquette. Not as good as Spain, but it'll suffice and I usually order it - Escargot: AMAZING! I really didn't know what to expect since I didn't have escargot in Spain but the snails were the perfect size and the sauce was amazing! - Chorizo with onions: Good Pitchers of sangria are $20 during happy hour. (I prefer the red) Can't beat that. Love this place!",1
2359,6,4,1/14/2013,"Get to the Chase: Pros: 1) First thing that I have to say is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING service (very friendly, courteous, and apologetic when it got crowded and service slowed down a bit) 2) Food is decent (Not spectacular, but pretty good) 3) Not too pricey $50 per person includes (10 large dishes + sangria pitcher + tip split between 6 people) 4) Fantastic live Flamenco + spanish guitar on the weekends 5) Sing happy birthday 6) Lively, boisterous, and fun atmosphere 7) A gem in a hit or miss neighborhood Cons: 1) Food wasn't mind-blowing or anything new 2) Definitely need reservations on the weekend or you'll be waiting a while",1
2360,6,3,1/6/2013,"A fun little restaurant that has great live flamenco performances on certain nights. It can get very crowded and reservations are recommended, but the three of us were eventually able to sit at the bar after a bit of a wait. The bartenders were very kind and helpful. Start off with a Moritz, a sweet and malty beer from Barcelona. It packs a lot more flavor than Estrella, another Spanish beer. Unfortunately, the tapas were not as good as the restaurants I went to in Barcelona. Not that I should expect the exact quality, but they were off by a decent amount and the prices were a lot higher too. The patatas bravas are supposed to be crispy with a creamy aoili and spicy red sauce. Instead, these were soft, soggy, and covered in what tasted like ketchup. They unfortunately did not have the simple pan con tomate (bread with crushed fresh tomatoes). The pan tumaca (bread with tomato, serrano, and machego) was good, but a really small bite. I would recommend squid in ink as mopping the sauce up with bread was probably my favorite part of the meal. The Spanish omelette stuffed with potatoes and onions was quite filling and a good pick as it's hard to get full on only small tapas plates. In the end, it was $30 with a beer and we all walked away stuffed. Not the great tapas meal, but worth a try if you're really in the mood. It at least has an atmosphere to it and is a good place to bring a date.",1
2361,6,2,1/6/2013,"So apparently this is the place where all the Spanish people go to have traditional Spanish tapas...or so I was told. Â I guess this makes sense, because when we walked in and tried to order, everything was already out for the night - the waiter just shook his head and said ""there were a lot of Spanish here tonight"". Â He may have said ""Spaniards"", but i suspect my mind changed it to ""Spaniards"" and I fear my mind can be a little racist without my knowledge, so in case ""Spaniards"" is a derogatory term, I'll have to assume he didn't say it. Now that that's out of the way. Â The best thing about this place? the atmosphere is ADORABLE. Â If you don't care about food quality, this is a fantastic date place. Amazing. you walk in, and you initially become skeptical because it's ""garden level"" which, as most of you know, means ""basement"". Â Gross. Â However, the room opens up to this brick-facade-d, dimly-lit, soft orange/red glowing cozy little nook of a restaurant. Â Insta-romance, folks. Â The place is for the guy who says ""i want to make my gal think I'm a little bit romantic and a little bit fun, wrapped in a coating of laid-back."" The food we were able to get our hands on (as everything was out) was a meager order of blood sausage (too dry and chewy but otherwise OK) and a greasy dish of octopus pieces. Â Sadly, the octopus chunks were all covered in fat and too greasy to get a good grasp on long enough to travel to my mouth, so we left hungry and disappointed. However, the sangria was delicious, the service was great (friendly Spanish man to pop up occasionally when we least expected it), and the vibe was perfect. Â Will i go back? Sure. but only to sit at the bar and have a drink with friends.",1
2362,6,4,1/4/2013,"Went with a girlfriend and waited a bit. Place is small and crowded, but staff are friendly and food and drinks are good. We sat at the bar and the bartender was nice and attentive. They had huge glass jugs/kegs of sangria of different types. Other drink selections were well diversified. Tapas were all good, though I forgot which ones we ordered since we pretty much got one of each. No complaints here.",1
1599,6,4,1/1/2013,"If you're looking for a tapas bar to chill at with friends, Nais Tapas Bar is the place you should be at. It's definitely an amazing intimate tapas bar that's a must go if you're in the area. Each dish is packed with flavored and the sangria measures the same! This is a good place to celebrate an occasion. The staff is amazingly friendly here & great with suggestions. Everything is also decently priced, which is a plus if you love eating out without breaking the bank!",1
2363,6,4,12/25/2012,"Had a great time here for my birthday party of 9 ppl. The owner is very professional and a super easygoing, friendly guy who makes your special day as special as it can be. I came on flamenco night and made a reservation 2 weeks before. What was so surprising to me was that I had my reservation confirmed the day OF, via a very nice phone call from the restaurant. The tapas were great. I had a number of their potato tapas, which were so well-flavored - I highly recommend the garlic potato tapas. I didn't like the octopus dish very much and the white asapagus dish was quite bland. Also, I wouldn't get the dish with clams again because it came with about 4 baby clams, but the sauce it was in was quite yummy. The live flamenco band and dancers were a nice touch and entertaining to watch. Oh, and there is a surprise if you are the birthday girl... oh yes, there is a surprise.... OMG and how can I forget the MANGO SANGRIA! SO DELICIOUS! Probably the best sangria in townnn. Get a pitcher, heck get two pitchers!! Every gulp was savory good and gave the perfect amount of buzz.",1
2364,6,3,12/20/2012,"Ate: Gambas, Cod wrapped with potato, pork loin, chorizo Drank: Sangria Liked: Gambas were good. Â Cute space and very authentic. Disliked: Music was too loud and we were trying to talk. Â Not their fault, but wasn't our speed. Sangria was weak. Chicken: None! Â Chicken haters would love this place! Would mom like it?: Â Mom would go up and try to dance with them to all of our embarrassment. Would I go back: Yes, on a night without the live music. Recommend: Gambas Al Ajillo. Â That's like the calamri of Tapas places. Â And I love it.",1
2365,6,5,12/15/2012,"Seriously, a great place! Went for my birthday last night and it was just amazing meal. My roommate woke up this morning and she thinks she dreamt of the gambas con ajo. Staff was super nice too. We had an 8:45 reservation and clearly had to call to say we'd be running late. We did have to wait maybe 15-20 minutes for table after that, but the food was WELL worth the wait. Every single dish we got was amazing. The mussels are divine, and you get a TON. Definitely go for the papas bravas and shrimp with garlic. Both excellent and good judges for a great tapas place! Escargot are also to die for. We also got peppers stuffed with cheese and a salad, both solid dishes. The bread is good, olive top notch, and really attentive staff. Also, really good/strong sangria! You can taste the brandy and the fruit is like a shot in each piece. Now I didn't see the bill, perks of the being the birthday girl, but my friends assured I didn't bankrupt them! I can't wait to go back and definitely want to check it out on Thursday or Saturday for the free flamenco show! I'd make a reservation if you're planning on going during the weekend before 9:30, it was packed when we showed up at 9:15 and there was a steady stream of people.",1

Â We tried the fried goat cheese on toast, patatas braves, albondigas, gambas al ajillo, sliced steak, and chorizo wrapped witth potato. Â All of our choices were delicious. Â We ended the meal with the coconut flan. We went on a Thursday evening and enjoyed a flamenco show while we ate with great music. Â It reminded me of being in Spain. Our server, Unua, was so accommodating and friendly. Â  We will definitely be back!",1

After we finished our meal they didn't pressure us to leave which was really nice because a friend was visiting from out of town so it was great to catch up. Also get the sangria, you won't regret it!",1
2371,6,5,11/28/2012,"I was very impressed by Nai. Their tapas selection is great, making it so hard to choose. I tried about 7 different tapas, all were good, but my favorites were the following: Fried goat cheese- Awesome goat cheese balls wrapped in jamon served on a tomato and toast cracker. Pure awesome. It works so incredibly well. Chorizo riojana- Think patatas bravas with chunks of chorizo mixed in. Whether it was a potato or the sausage, every bite made me so happy. Meatballs (albondiguillas estofadas)- Tasty and savory. These came in a delicious sauce which I had to dip the bread in. Seriously, prepare to soak it all up! The staff was great. Â The manager came over a few times to check on our table, see how things were going. He was super friendly and even gave us complementary shots of some dessert liquor! Â Which I didn't need- I was sufficiently buzzed off the mango sangria. Â Watch out, it may taste like fruit juice but it must have a lot of alcohol masked in it. The tropical sangria is also good but the mango was just a tad better. There are also live flamenco shows twice a week. I'd love to check these out!",1
2372,6,4,11/26/2012,"Great service, in particular Jenny behind the bar. Took the recommendations from some of the other reviews, the shrimp in garlic and the potatoes in aioli were really tasty.

2373,6,5,11/23/2012,Great tapas place right near where I live. Everything we ordered was great except for the dessert. Â  We especially loved the skirt steak and ordered a second round!

2374,6,4,11/22/2012,"I don't usually like tapas places because they're way too expensive and not all that worth it. This is an exception. Came here with a buddy to talk business, and asked the waiter to just give us his selection of his favorites. The guy was awesome, super friendly, really fast with the service, extremely considerate. Turns out that the tapas were REALLY freakin' good! We ordered another round at his choice, and it was also fantastic. Sadly I don't remember what they were, but I would totally bring friends here if they're in the mood for a little tapas action!",1

Â There is also an extensive tapas menu, which come in bigger servings too. Â For four people we ordered 6 tapas - along with the bread they give you - and that was the perfect amount of food. Â The food was delicious, the favorites being a fried goat cheese, potatoes in a garlic alioli, and the skirt steak. For six plates of tapas and two pitchers of sangria we each paid $30 something, including tip - must more inexpensive than we were expecting! Plan on going back here very soon!",1
2376,6,2,10/29/2012,"If I had reviewed Nai Tapas from the very beginning up until when our first plates came out, they would have gotten a 5. While the food was delicious, and the service started out great, I left incredibly disappointed. After our plates came out, our server didn't bother to come check on us at all. Apparently, the group next to us was much more important than my friend and I, since he was over there constantly. We wanted desert, but no one bothered to glance at us. We had to wave someone down for our bill. It was tempting to leave unnoticed. Both my friend and I are foodies and pay whatever it takes to have a great meal (we paid over $200 each at WD-50 the night before). We highly value customer service and therefore tip very generously. I left a small tip (because for some reason felt guilty not tipping at all) with a long note on the receipt expressing my disappointment. Too bad, it seemed nice.",1

2379,6,4,10/24/2012,"I came here on a very random Tuesday night with a friend from out of town after reading reviews of it on Serious Eats and Yelp. Wow, did the restaurant live up to the hype! I had the following dishes: Mejillones RÃ­as Baixas (galician style mussels in garlic, virgin olive oil and white wine) - AMAZING!! GET THIS, GET THIS! The mussels were cooked perfectly, but the sauce is the claim to fame. Make sure to ask for refills on your bread basket just to soak up all of the sauce and enjoy it deliciousness. Â  Boquerones De Zumaia (imported basque anchovies) - Not the best, but an interesting flavor combination. Make sure you really like anchovies. Pulpo A La Gallega (spanish octopus in virgin olive oil, sprinkled with sea salt and sweet paprika) - The octopus was a little too squishy for my taste, but had great flavor. EspÃ¡rragos Navarros (imported white asparagus with a minced onion and pepper vinaigrette) - This was on the menu as white asparagus with a pink sauce (I think). Nice mild flavor and a good complement to the other dishes with major flavors. Patatas Bravas (spicy potatoes gently coated with our spicy house tomato sauce) - The way I want all my potatoes to be - crispy and covered in a red sauce similar to hot sauce. Perfection. Pimientos De Piquillo Rellenos (piquillo peppers stuffed with salted cod) - So good! That cod is no joke and the flavor was amazing. I took one star off because the service once our meal was over was a little slow, which was off considering it was a quiet Tuesday evening. Otherwise, amazing!",1

This particular time ( and many times before) we got skirt steak, cheesy potatoes, roasted pepper and melted cheese on toast, tuna empanadas, beef empanadas, the ox tail stew (special of the day), and the lava cake. EVERYTHING was delicious and well prepared! In addition, we had the mango sangria which was perfect! I've also had a variety of their sangrias and they are all very good!

2387,6,5,9/28/2012,"Generously accommodated our 13-person birthday party (with 2 weeks notice) Flamenco show was entertaining beyond expectation Service stood out as authentic Spanish - friendly, quick, not intrusive We never felt rushed to leave or clear out I recommend getting a dessert from the italian bakery next door if celebrating a birthday (they will bring it out and serve it as if you bought it there) Coming here will become a tradition! Highlights from the menu: Spicy clams Fried goat cheese Patatas bravas Gabas in garlic sauce Pomegranate champagne sangria",1
2388,6,1,9/27/2012,"i'm just totally perplexed as to why this place is always crowded. worst tapas i've ever had. would expect this caliber of tapas at a mall in rural america, not in the middle of new york city. and that's being tough on mid-america malls. the bread they gave us was stale. the octopus tasted slimy and salty. the patatas bravas were basically Ore Ida hash brown potatoes doused in ketchup and wing sauce. the goat cheese was the only thing that was OK to eat and that's because you really can't eff up fried cheese. the service was great and they gave us a discount on sangria, as well as taking the octopus off our bill after we told them we didn't like it.",1
2389,6,4,9/23/2012,"I dine at tapas restaurants quite frequently, and I have to say that this is one of the better ones I've been to. Some quick tips: *The Patatas Alioli, which were potatoes basted in a creamy garlic alioli sauce, and the mussels prepared in a paprika wine sauce were absolutely amazing. *Meat was very very flavorful. *The wait staff was outstanding. *The prices were very reasonable. *$20 sangria pitchers / $11 beer pitchers during happy hour. Â How can you complain? Will DEFINITELY be coming back! Â :)",1
2390,6,5,9/20/2012,"5 - octopus. Subtle. Tender. Tasted like the ocean indeed. i highly recommend getting this since i haven't found octupus like this anywhere else. subtle - dont' expect strong flavors 5 - ham croquettes. Creamy delish 5 - goat cheese ball w Serrano ham wrapped around it. how can that not be good? 5 - escargot. Loaded w garlic and I'm sure gobs of butter. 4 - skirt steak. Perfectly cooked. Sauce was great, otherwise I make a similar delicious skirt steak at home so i prolly won't get again 4 - squid ink. Really good. I've had better at Tia Pol 4 - chorizo. good. not a must 4 - paella special. Of pasta not rice. must'be been craving carbs after the protein injection 4 - assorted charcuterie plate. I'm assuming this was good since Dave ate the whole thing and no one else got to try any. Thanks Dave. 4 - garlic shrimp. Have u tastes garlic shrimp before? That's what it tasted like. 2 - sangria. Couldn't taste any alcohol in it. fail No liquor license meaning only beer and wine would be my main complaint. Appreciated the service or free pitcher of beer and sangria at the end. everyone too bloated to finish it, but thank you guys!",1
2391,6,5,9/18/2012,"We went here with a group of 11 , they were very accommodating . The sangria was flowing and the food was amazing. Definitely go if you want a good show and good food.",1
2392,6,3,9/16/2012,"Four stars for the food: Â My friend and I ordered five tapas, and unfortunately I don't remember them but they were all very delicious. Â So I expect it's like that for everything on their menu. The three stars is for the service. Â It started out great, but they forgot about my party at the end. Â There was a birthday party and what it seemed like a bachelorette party (there was a table of all women). Â And our waiter completely forgot about us. Â Which is sad because that soured our experience. We happen to catch part of the flamenco show, which was great. Â But it can get pretty loud in there so I'd only go if I wanted a livelier atmosphere.",1
1844,6,5,9/12/2012,"I do not give out 5 star reviews easily. I have given out less than 10 while I have reviewed hundreds of businesses. This place has the rare distinction of deserving all 5 stars from me. Everything from the food to the service to the decor was just perfect. The gf and I had been on a weekend binge of popular restaurants around manhattan. The night before, we went to Sakagura. You can find my review of it elsewhere on Yelp. On the whole, Nai was definitely on par with if not better than Sakagura in terms of dining experience. In the past, I had tried to come around 6-8PM on a Saturday but the place was so packed that night I was told I had no chance of a seat without a reservation. In hindsight, it must have been flamenco night. This time, we got there at 6PM on a Monday and were, surprisingly, the first customers of the night. We sat outside and was tended to by Uno, who was a very friendly and helpful waiter. He made recommendations on sangrias and told us about the happy hour specials. $3 beers and $20 pitchers of sangria. $10 for a half pitcher. He had no qualms about moving our whole table inside when it got cold. The inside decor is all wood and dimly lit, creating a nice moody ambience with a rustic feel to it. There are barrels on the wall where the beer taps are. The place is actually quite large for a New York restaurant and you would never expect it looking in from the outside. The tables are also nicely spaced apart and you aren't cramped together like sardines like at most restaurants that try to maximize seats - and therefore profit - at the expense of customer comfort. People began coming in between 6 and 8 and the restaurant was very lively by the time our food came out. Churrasco - the steak was very flavorful and just chewy enough. The garlic sauce is amazing and you just want to spread it all over the bread and stuff your face with just that. Croquettes - we had the jamon and the bacalao, of which I preferred the jamon. It was the creamiest croquette I have ever had with a perfect crispy crust that offered vital contrast with the soft well-whipped filling. Pulpo de la gallega - the octopus by far was the best thing I had all night. So tender and full of natural ocean flavor. How long must they have massaged the octopus before cooking it? I could have eaten two plates of it. Definitely a rare find and the piece de resistance of this establishment. Squid in ink - very subtle flavor that is hard to find anywhere else. I soaked some bread in the ink and it was delicious. Patatas - I had the bravas and the alioli, of which I liked the bravas more. The patatas are cut into very small cubes almost like hash. The flavor gets in better that way. The bravas had a nice spicy and tangy red sauce smothering it. The alioli was good also but had a more subtle mayo flavor. The sangrias - we had the mango and the champagne pomegranate, of which I preferred the pomegranate because I like tangy drinks. The mango was also good except I didn't actually see mango as a component fruit in the drink so it's more likely that they used canned mango juice. In any case, both were good and I was feeling quite well after sharing two half pitchers with my gf who was completely inebriated at the end of our dinner. They also have a fine beer selection including Estrella, Mahou, and San Miguel which we took advantage of at $3 a pop during happy hour. The service, finally, was nothing short of impressive. Very attentive. Super friendly. Never intrusive. We were told we should definitely come back on Thurs and Sat for the flamenco show but to reserve a week in advance as it fills up quickly. The whole meal ended up running us a tab of $86 which is very reasonable for how much we stuffed ourselves. I added a $20 tip which made the total just north of a flat hundo. The sangrias at full price I would think were too much for what you get but I plan on coming here only during their amazing happy hour. Nai is my new favorite tapas place, better than both Pata Negra, La Boqueria, and even some of the arguably more authentic places in Spain itself.",1
2393,6,4,9/11/2012,"Our group of 3 walked in on a Thursday night around 7:30. They were fully booked but luckily we managed to get seating at the bar after 10 minutes. They have a Flamenco group performing on Thursday and Saturday nights (starts at 8:30pm) so I figured we got lucky. Space was small but not uncomfortable and once the sangria came out, the evening kicked off nicely. Food was mostly 4 stars. The 3 of us got 6 small plates to share: Mejillones Avoa (Mussels in paprika-wine sauce): Asking for more bread to soak up the mussel sauce is a good thing. We had to put in an effort not to fill ourselves with bread. The mussels were cooked just right . 4/5 Pelotillas de Queso de Cabra (Fried goat cheese over a slice of tomato & toast wrapped in imported Serrano ham): We really loved the slightly creamy texture to the goat cheese and the ham had good flavor to it. Came with 3 toasts so it was perfect for us to share. 4.5/5 Croqeutas de Cancalo (Salt cod croquettes): Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside with just the right amount of seasoning. Came with 3 croquettes. 4/5 Patatas Bravas (Potatoes coated with spicy house tomato sauce): This is the only dish I didn't like. The potatoes had no texture and the spicy house tomato sauce tasted like buffalo wing sauce. I am surprised this dish got such lavish praises on yelp. 2/5 Churraso Arriero (Skirt steak sautÃ©ed with garlic and spicy cherry peppers): Better than I expected. The steak was cooked perfectly and the flavors worked well. 4/5 Chorizo Salteado con Cebolla (Spanish sausage sautÃ©ed with onions): The chorizo had good flavor, that's all that matters. 4/5 In the middle of our meal, the flamenco show started. It was pretty entertaining. I found it pretty amazing that the two dancers and the musicians were performing in what must be the tiniest stage in NY. In general, I find most many tapas places overcharging for the amount of food they put out. The check for our 6 dishes and a sangria pitcher was $78 with t&t (that's $26 pp if your math sucks). For the quality of the food, service and entertainment, Nai Tapas Bar knocks it out of the park in terms of value.",1
2394,6,5,9/10/2012,"Hot, Steamy Flamenco dance show...waiter make lady happy...food make me happy...win",1
2395,6,4,9/3/2012,Great food and good sangria! Â Watch out for the old people that get pestered by big groups.,1
2396,6,2,9/2/2012,"Ratings: Food 1 out of 5 Ambiance 3 out of 5 Service 4 out of 5 Entertainment 3 out of 5 Overall the food kinda sucked. Â Nothing really stood out and definitely not a meal I would go back for. Â But on other fronts, it was good. Â Service was very good (I just wish the food was better). Â Towards the later half of our meal, there was live entertainment on their small ""stage"" towards the center of the restaurant. Â The 2 ladies who were performing stomp their feet and clap their hands and dance around. Â I am not doing a great job explaining this but it was entertaining and fun for the first 15-20 minutes but then it just got too loud and boring (overdone a bit, the show was too long, it's difficult to carry a conversation while this show is going on because it's so loud and long). I hate rating this place badly because they had such great service but sadly, they just dont hit the mark with the food and thats the whole point of going out to eat...",1
2397,6,3,8/30/2012,"The service was the bomb. Our waiter recommended the octopus for us, so we got it. We ended up not not really liking it, so we didn't finish it. The waiter gave us a complimentary drink when he noticed we didn't eat much of it. The sangria was fine, but after an entire pitcher, I didn't feel remotely buzzed. Also, it was a little too sweet for my taste. I also tried the meatballs, but they were nothing out of the ordinary. Also, the fried peppers stuffed with cheese tasted just like that. They were okay, but they might have been better if they were made with a more spicy peppers, instead of a red pepper. The service was so great, I feel bad for not really wanting to go back because I have had better Spanish food in the city.",1
2398,6,2,8/29/2012,"This was the Friday night hotspot with very authentic Spanish tapas. Unfortunately the service was terrible and even though we had a reservation it took them forever to get us seated, get our drinks and even get our food. They were also out of a bunch of stuff which is a little more forgiving since we were there at like 10pm at night. Once the food finally came out it was pretty good though. We had stuffed red peppers, spicy potatoes, meatballs, etc. I thought the peppers and the meatballs were the best but overall I've had better tapas. It wasn't too expensive which made it worthwhile and was close to the karaoke bar we were going to so overall not a waste but I don't need to go back.",1
2399,6,5,8/26/2012,"This is really 4.5 stars - the only 'bad' thing I would say about this place is that the menu could be a bit more inventive. Its primarily Galician staples and they're done quite well at an excellent price (I realize I'm supposed to be complaining right now) and that's really great but I'd love to see a bit more unconventional stuff and that's not really their style. But what is their style is incredibly affordable, very well executed dishes served up by a highly competent and friendly staff. You can see why the 'complaining' portion was relatively short. We arrived 15 minutes before their kitchen closed on a Sat night and, despite informing us of that, which is entirely reasonable, they then went on to clean off a table for 6 and make it available to us in under 2 minutes. Like watching a nascar pit crew I tell you. Then they brought out dishes quickly and yet everything was clearly just made. Great beer selection including Estrella on tap which is exactly what I needed to go with my octopus, galician style. Will definitely be coming back here - good stuff.",1
2400,6,4,8/25/2012,"Fun, authentic, and absolutely perfect for any occasion. I am growing to be a big fan of tapas. I just love the format of sharing small plates with friends, so that you can try a great variety of different dishes. Add a pitcher or two of sangria (like the deliciously sweet and refreshing red sangria we had here), and you really can't go wrong with good food and good company. Some notable things I had here that I would recommend: - Gambas al ajillo (shrimp in garlic sauce) - Serrano croquettes - Patatas bravas (in the red, slightly spicy tomato sauce) - Skirt steak with garlic and peppers - Chorizo with garlic and onions - Assorted jamon and cheese I also like that Nai offers most of their tapas in 2 different sizes, a small ""tapas"" size and a larger ""racion"" option, making it easy to order more or less depending on how many people are in your party. The service here is also stellar, amazing hospitality for a casual restaurant.",1
2401,6,4,8/24/2012,Great service and food!,1
2402,6,4,8/22/2012,"3.5 for the food; adding 0.5 for being affordable. The menu is quite Spanish. I spent 10 days in Spain, during Semana Santa, doing nothing but eating and partying. So I'm reasonably familiar with what the food tastes like there. I have to agree with a previous review that the food is fine but nothing special. I wouldn't stay here for hours spending tons of money sampling all kinds of tapas, like I did at Eslava in Sevilla, where the locals feasted. But, East Village is not Spain. Hence four stars. The bartender on Monday night Â is super nice.",1
2403,6,4,8/20/2012,"The flamenco show was awesome! It was such a fun experience! The service was also really good and the staff are very attentive. I think salt-cod croquettas were definitely the best dish I had, followed by the mussells and then the stuffed peppers. Yum! The peppers took a little longer to come out but I think that's because they take extra care making them.",1
2404,6,3,8/16/2012,"I had wanted to go here for ages, and finally went last weekend for a date with my husband. Â The restaurant inside is very tiny, and it looked like one of the only larger group tables was a high table (kind of annoying). Â I was disappointed that the show wasn't on (we went on a Friday). The bartender and the waiter we had (Raul) were excellent - funny, quick, and everything else you could hope for in a waiter. I was let down by the food, and didn't think it was that flavorful in the end. Â We had the squid, the anchovies, the croquetas, meatballs and the chorizo. Â They were all fine but didn't really taste that good (I've lived in Spain as well). Â The one thing I absolutely did enjoy was the tortilla .... delicious (but maybe a bit too eggy for the potato ratio). Â  This would not be a good date restaurant while the show is going on, it was too loud and small and chaotic (we stopped by on Saturday to check it out). Â  Inexpensive, but just OK.",1
2405,6,3,8/14/2012,"I came with a group of girls, which was great because they took reservations. I didn't come during the flamenco show so maybe that in itself is worth another star. The 3 stars is for the food - good but not anything more spectacular than other tapa restaurants. Make sure to get their pitcher of sangria- now THAT is delcious and worth coming for!",1
2406,6,3,8/13/2012,"Not three stars but not quite four. I'd totally give this place a 3 1/2. A friend and I randomly decided to try Nai Tapas Bar on a Friday night as we were both not too hungry. I have to say, the best thing about this place was probably the service (who even says that about a place anymore?!?). The bartender who got us a table was really nice and our waiter was just the best. My friend was worried about getting a fruity sangria since she's not a huge fan of sweet drinks and our waiter was hilarious and so helpful. He told us a bit about each sangria and promised to give us a cheaper deal on our next 1/2 pitcher if we didn't like the mango. Of course....we loved it! Great sangria that's not too sweet! You have to go for the sangria! The food on the other hand....was just ok. I know it's tapas and so the portions are always small but I guess what we ordered was really small. We both enjoyed the food but it was nothing special. I actually really liked the Squid in Ink. So, on the whole, I'd go back to Nai but maybe just for the sangria and one or two tapas plates. It's a great atmosphere though.",1
2407,6,4,8/10/2012,"Awesome tapas, sangria, and service. First, the tapas. They were pretty legit and reasonably priced. We ordered the Albondiguillas Estofadas (meatballs), Chorizo a La Plancha (grilled Spanish sausage), Gambas Al Ajillo (shrimp in garlic sauce), Almejas Diablo (clams in a spicy sauce), and Pollo Al Ajillo (chicken and potatoes in a garlic sauce). This came with unlimited bread that was crusty and perfect for dipping into the delicious sauces. The clams weren't really that spicy at all (which means something, because I have little to no tolerance for spicy food), which was great for me, but if you're expecting something smoking hot, prepare to be disappointed. The Gambas Al Ajillo were my favorite--large shrimp in garlicky goodness. Portion sizes were pretty decent. There were three of us and we were definitely full by the end of the meal. Secondly, the drinks. There are give or take six different flavors of sangria to choose from. One of my friends who had been here previously mentioned that the red and white wine based sangrias are dryer, the mango and tropical flavored sangrias are sweeter, and the champagne based sangrias are in the middle. They all sounded delicious, so we wanted to get a small sample of the mango flavored one to decide whether or not it was too sweet for us (it was). I expected them to give us a small cup to just take a sip--but no, our Â awesome waiter brought us a giant glass to sample for free! Definitely a bonus. We ended up getting a pitcher of the champagne sangria, because it was happy hour and only $20. The pitcher special goes for the whole night, while the glass ($5) and half pitcher ($10) happy hour deals go until 7PM. Third, the service. I arrived a bit early for my reservations (which were pretty unnecessary, but I wanted my OpenTable points), so I sat at the bar waiting for my friends to come. The bartender was very friendly, explained the happy hour specials, and even gave me tips on what drinks to order or not. Our waiter was also so nice (and pretty easy on the eyes haha) and all the other servers made sure our glasses were always filled with sangria and our bread basket filled with bread. If you have questions, they are definitely patient and willing to explain everything on the menu. It was pretty empty when we went (6:30 on a Tuesday), so our food came pretty quickly. Might be a different story on a busier night. All in all, a solid experience. Reminded me of my weekend trip to Madrid when I studied abroad. I'll definitely be going back!",1
2408,6,5,8/8/2012,"Great food. Great atmosphere and very nice waiter. I brought my boyfriend, which was from out of town, to this restaurant and he thoroughly enjoyed it. The bill didn't come out to be too bad either. And I came on a Friday night so I didn't see the dance show. Overall, I had a great time and recommend it to everyone.",1
2409,6,4,8/8/2012,"Great tapas experience! The tapas were fairly priced ($6 or so on average) and savory. Everything seemed authentic, from the chorizo to the clams. The sauces were particularly great - dip some bread in and you have a good top-off for your meal. Went around 7pm on a Tuesday, so the palce was fairly empty. The waiters were all great! They gave us an entire glass of sangria when we just wanted to to taste one flavor... we ended getting a pitcher for $20 happy hour, which was a pretty good deal. Seems like it would be a fun place to go back to at night for live music.",1
2410,6,4,8/7/2012,"Had no problems getting a reservation for a Monday night, and was pleasantly surprised to find they offer $20 pitchers of sangria on Mon-Wed! woooo Dining partner looooved the beef empanadas, and I do agree they were quite good. Also enjoyed the chorizo with onion and the clams in spicy sauce. Not such a fan of the gazpacho shot accompanying a toothpick with olives, beans, and anchovies - it was supposed to be a flavor explosion, but was kind of weird. Was pretty disappointed by the boiled octopus, which I found sooo textureless and flavorless, blech. Ended with the almond tart for dessert. It was decent, but I would rather have taken the money and gone to get dessert at Blackhound around the corner. Friendly and fast service. Interesting that they're still using a paper-based system to keep track of orders. Might come back for flamenco night to see what that's like~",1
2411,6,3,7/30/2012,"I went here for my birthday dinner because it was under the ""good for groups"" category. Â I also wanted some small eats we could share. Â The food was delicious and this is probably one of the better tapas joints I've been too. The wait looked long but we had reservations and sat down very quickly. Unfortunately - I did not realize we were there for ""flamenco night."" Â Unless you are there for the spectacle, I would avoid flamenco night. Â  Sadly our table was literally against the small flamenco ""stage"" and the performers even bumped into my friend a few times. Â It was SO loud we all lost our voices the next day. The flamenco dancing was beautiful & fun to watch... but I would avoid Nai on flamenco night if you are looking for a quiet spot to chat with friends. Â Otherwise - the food was good and the people were friendly.",1
2412,6,5,7/29/2012,"Love this place! Make reservations, especially if you want a good table for the flamenco show. Â Tapas were delicious. Â Very close to what you'd find in Spain. Â Highlights were: Pulpo - probably my favorite. tender, smokey and delicious Squid in ink jamon and machengo plate Grilled sardines Clams Our server was soo super sweet. Â We bonded over Bilbao and his Basque background. Â This is definitely a place I want to come back to.",1
2413,6,5,7/26/2012,"This place is FANTASTIC. I went twice in just the span of three days. The first time I went on a Saturday night with a group of friends. We just happened to stumble upon Nai and went in. Little did we know there was a live flamenco show going on! The show made the restaurant way too loud to have proper conversation, but the tapas made up for it. All of the food was great. That first night we had: -Squid in its own ink (FANTASTIC! Especially if you use the appetizer bread and dip it in the ink) -Caracoles (escargot in a sauce, this was great too) -Some kind of chorizo, which I didn't get to try -Beef empanadas (good) I went again with a friend on a Monday at around 5PM and the place was quieter. There was no flamenco show and there were a lot of free tables. This is the ideal time to go for someone like me, who doesn't enjoy very loud places. This time we had: -Bacalaitos (AWESOME!) -Beef empanadas -The squid in its own ink -Blood sausage (GREAT) -Some kind of potato dish (which I didn't try) Everything I've had here is so full of flavor and well cooked. It really makes me trust Â them. But the best part? Their food is always served HOT! I'm the kind of person who needs all their food to be served at a very high temperature in order to enjoy it. I can't stand when something is served cold, or even when it's served warm. Everything I had at Nai was very hot, just the way I like it. The service was also great both times. We didn't have to wait too long for our food, and our waiters were very kind and attentive on both occasions. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. I can't wait to return to try the rest of their dishes!",1
2414,6,4,7/22/2012,"Great food, very nice establishment and beautiful.",1
2415,6,5,7/22/2012,"My new favorite restaurant in the entire city. I walk by this place every single day of my life on my way to work, and I have been tempted to try it for months because I am a lover of both tapas and flamenco. Today was finally the day to go, and I arrived at around 9:40pm, asking for a table for two. Little did I know that my lovely friend would make me wait for an entire hour and a half, but the staff was extremely gracious about the fact that they were basically losing money since my table could have gone to someone else in the meantime, instead of having me sitting there waiting... and waiting... and waiting... You guys have no idea how much I appreciate the fact that they were so nice about it and never tried to rush me. Anyway, when I decided that I had had enough of ogling at everyone else's food while my little table remained empty as I waited for my friend, I finally decided to order a few things. First, the gambas al ajillo, let me tell you, this is the number one reason why I wanted to go to a tapas place so badly today, I have been craving gambas for months, and these actually surpassed (by a loooootttt) all my expectations. In the end we (yes, my friend did eventually show up) ordered like three servings. We also had the croquetas de bacalao and pollo, and the pelotillas de queso de cabra with serrano ham. I am still not over how delicious every single thing was. Absolutely fantastic. The drinks are also amazing, the tinto de verano is pretty tasty, but then I had the mango sangrÃ­a and I almost died. I still cannot believe how exquisite it is. On top of all that, the dessert was also perfect, the tarta de Santiago, beautifully balanced. Service was the absolute best, David and AndrÃ©s became my pals tonight, and I am definitely looking forward to coming back much more frequently from now on. The ambiance and music were definitely my style, as I knew every song they played. And, let's please not forget, the flamenco show was yet another highlight of this wonderful experience. This is definitely a place I will be recommending to everyone I know.",1
2416,6,4,7/20/2012,"This is a cute space. Â We sat at the bar, and the woman who was bartending was sweet and also pretty attentive considering how busy they were. Â I had the patatas bravas, which were coated in a spicy tomato based sauce - absolutely delicious. Â I also had the pimientos de piquillo rellenos with cheese, a breaded fried pimiento stuffed with a small amount of cheese served on toast. Â That one was a little oily for my me, but tasted ok. Â As a vegetarian, there were a few more options that I hope to try next time. Â  We had the red sangria. Heaven have mercy. Â It was sooooooooooooo good. I only chose to show some type of home training because I was in public, but if I'd been at home (or in the trust tree of friends only) I would have basically put a straw straight in the pitcher. Â Pretty reasonably priced ($10 for both of my tapas) and they had a flamenco with live music accompaniment. Â  Overall, a very pleasant experience. :)",1
2417,6,5,7/11/2012,"Yet another reason I love NYC. Â  Walking into a restaurant and being transported back to a memory or a far away land with authentic music and delicious foods. This cozy tapas bar is bookshelved by by beautiful brick walls. Behind the actual bar are kegs of wine for your sangria drinking pleasure. Â (Side note for Filipinos: They carry San Miguel$6!!) . Service on a Saturday night at 10:30pm was so so. Â Super friendly hostess directed us to the bar as we waited for our table. Â Same lady turned out being our server as well since they were short handed that night. Â She did it all. Â We did have long waits in between being seated, ordering, and being served. Â Fortunately the live music and Flamenco dancers were a fun distraction. Â (Live Flamenco Live Flamenco shows on Saturdays at 7:30pm & 10:30pm). Â Not to mention the pitchers of tasty sangria that kept flowing. Â They come in all sizes: by the glass, the half pitcher, and whole pitcher. Very authentic menu. Actual Spanish people eat here. Â That's a good sign you found a good tapas joint. Â Tapas here reminded me of my trip to Madrid from years back. Â  All the food had great flavor but was a bit inconsistent at times. Â We ordered the Churrasco Arriero -$19(skirt steak sautÃ©ed with garlic and spicy cherry peppers) and enjoyed it so much that we put in for another order. Â Our second serving left us a bit unsatisfied, not as much flavor-as if the cooking process was rushed. Â Tortilla Espanola (traditional Spanish omlet with onions & potatoes-$10) Â is a must order as well as the olives stuffed with anchovies and potatoes. Â  Final round up: 4 girls:4 half pitchers of sangria (try all their flavors, all delicious!) + about 8 plates of hot tapas = $40/girl including tax & tip.",1
2418,6,5,7/9/2012,"I was there last Sat at 7 pm. Our last 2 guests were running late but the host offered to seat us right away. The bread they gave us as we waited was nothing special. The crust was too hard. The olives were tasty though. When the full party has arrived, we ordered a whole bunch of tapas and as well as the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria. The sangria was excellent. Not too strong and really refreshing. I, personally, LOVED the Pulpo A La Gallega (octopus), the Churrasco Arriero (skirt steak), the Gambas Al Ajillo (shrimp in garlic sauce), and the Pan Tumaca (serrano ham and manchego cheese on toast). So delicious. We also ordered a pitcher of the red sangria- good but i preferred the blueberry. We ordered more food but the restaurant was so busy (don't know when it happened but all of a sudden I noticed it was packed) that we had to wait. And we waited what felt like an eternity. After inquiring about our food, our waiter Raul brought us brought us a free plate of tapas (i think the Patatas Alioli) as an apology for the delay. And then some time after that he brought us A FREE PITCHER OF SANGRIA. What? So awesome!! When we got our bill we thought they overcharged us so Raul very patiently explained each item to us. Not once, but twice. I was cringing inside but he was so friendly, nice, and helpful about it (turns out everything on the bill made sense, we weren't charged extra). We paid and as were leaving I waited for Raul to come clear the table. I asked for his name, thanked him, shook his hand, and gave him an extra bill- I was THAT impressed with the service. Without a doubt I am coming back here again. Oh and I can't believe I almost forgot about the flamenco dancers!! They were fantastic. It really helped create a fun and festive environment. Lol why bother travelling to Spain, j come to Nai Tapas Bar!!",1
2419,6,5,7/8/2012,"OMG, what a gem. Didn't have a reservation but as I was really in the mood for Tapas, we showed up. David was accommodating although he was super busy running around. The food was great, but now that I look back, everything we ordered was fried, maybe that's why? The goat cheese with serrano ham on toast - yummy ! The kicker was the amazing flamenco dancers. Who would've guessed? Our waiter Raul was super attentive and that just added to the whole experience of a warm, cozy atmosphere. I'm sure the other spanish yelpers can comment much better on the food, but basically I have zero complaints and the bill in the end was another pleasant surprise. ""Nai"" simply turned a simple casual catchup dinner, into an amazing experience.",1
2420,6,5,7/5/2012,"Nai translates to ""mother"" in Galician. Â As such, the images that come immediately to mind are those of my ""Spanish mother"", a woman with tremendous warmth who is always telling silly jokes, and treats me, her ""adopted daughter"", as one of her own. After being seated and looking at the menu, I was happy to see that food and beverages made me feel as though I was in Galicia again, possibly in the house of my Spanish mother. Â I never imagined that I could order a clarita (a draft beer with La Casera - a brand of soda) or kalimotxo (a popular mixed drink of cheap red wine and Coca Cola) in the East Village. Â AND there was Spanish wine by the glass, Estrella Damm on draft, and my favorite, Estrella Galicia, by the bottle. On this particular Monday, the bar special of the day was $20 for a large pitcher of sangria. Â With five flavors available, we were unsure of which to order and requested a taste of mango sangria before committing to a whole pitcher. Â Our waiter brought us a large glass (which he let us finish and did not charge us for!) and both of us were surprised to taste a sweet and refreshing white-wine based sangria, with lots of wine-soaked apples. As for the tapas, they are probably some of the best that I have had here in the United States (and for me to say this is quite a statement!). Â Many of the recipes on the menu were passed down from Ana Maria Gonzalez Arias' grandmother, who hails from Galicia. You MUST order the pulpo a la gallega. Â It is so tender and practically melted in my mouth (FYI: octopus should never have ""texture"" or be chewy). Â When we asked the waiter about the recipe, he said the preparation is just as it is in Spain: the octopus is boiled briefly in water 3 or 4 times before the heat is lowered for it to cook normally. The albondigas were also fantastic. Â A pork-beef combination is used for the meatball itself and everything is slowly cooked in a tomato-brandy sauce. Â Be sure to use a slice of bread or two to enjoy more of the sauce! We also ordered a combination of croquetas de jamon and de bacalao. Â The filling for the croquetas de jamon was perfect - not too runny or pasty. Â Because bacalao is a very delicate fish, the flavors in those croquetas got a little ""lost"". Â Although I preferred the croquetas de jamon because they were more savory, both were very enjoyable. The beauty of Spanish food is that sometimes the simplest ingredients and most basic preparations are some of the most enjoyable. Â The bacalao frito, a preparation of cod fish lightly battered and fried and served with aioli sauce, was a perfect example of this. Â The handful of ingredients used allowed us to appreciate how fresh the fish was. Last, but certainly not least, we shared a slice of brazo gitano for dessert. Â Once again, I was flooded with memories of my Spanish mother who always makes a savory version of this sponge cake that can be filled with practically anything. Â Nai's rendition of this traditional dessert used an almond-sugar filling and was drizzled with chocolate. Â The sponge cake was perfectly moist, making this the perfect way to end the meal. Our waiter was extremely attentive and shared his enthusiasm for the menu with us over the course of dinner. Â He also gave us additional information about the flamenco performances that take place on the weekend and told us he hoped we would return. Â I am so happy to have found a place that brings back memories of Spain, while serving affordable food and drink in an atmosphere that makes me feel like family.",1
2421,6,4,7/4/2012,"I tried out this restaurant for the first time recently with a group of 5 friends. We were seated right away and Â the service remained excellent through the entire meal. The waiter was friendly and attentive. We had the red wine sangria (pitcher for $20) which was tasty! We ordered about 6 ""racions"" aka the larger tapas. We all agreed that it was plenty of food. Each dish was better than the next, we got everything from the garlic shrimp to the skirt steak. At the end we were all surprised at the total of the bill, such a bargain! We will definitely be going back.",1
2422,6,4,7/3/2012,"Stopped by here for a quick bite to eat last night. We ordered a pitcher of champagne sangria (yum) which was on special for $20! We ordered the shrimp in green sauce, octopus (galician style), and the skirt steak sauteed with garlic and spicy cherry peppers. Churrasco Arriero (skirt steak) - Probably the best dish. Ours was cooked perfectly to medium and the meat was well flavored and tender. The sauce/garnish that came with was refreshing, and I loved the pickled cherry peppers. Pulpo A La Gallega (octopus) - Our server warned that it might be a little chewy...honestly it was a bit too soft! I feel like the texture was off and it smelled a bit too fishy. Maybe an off day for this dish, but definitely not up to par with other octopus tapas that I've had. Shrimp in green sauce - The sauce for this was delicious. We sopped up the whole thing with the bread they provided. Overall, the ambiance was nice. We sat outside because it wasn't too hot or humid, but the servers were very attentive and came out frequently to pour our champagne sangria, refill our water, and check up on us. I thought some of the dishes were a bit pricey compared to other tapas joints, but some of the vegetarian dishes were a bit cheaper. Evens out in the end. I would recommend coming here sometime Mon-Wed and taking advantage of the $20 pitcher!",1
2423,6,5,7/3/2012,"Every once in a while, one of the show ponies from my stable of thoroughbreds wants edification that she's special. Â So, I gotz ta do what I gotz ta do...take her for a deelish dinner. Â  In this case, since she was Castillian, and since I've been to Spain multiple times, I took her to a legit tapas bar to impress her. - Decor/Ambience: Pretty packed and loud...but very fun. Â I'm not a flamenco connoisseur, but it was def cool to watch. - Draaaanks: White sangria was kind of tart but the mango sagria was off the chains...drank waaaay too much (which is status quo on a date) - Fare: Tapas is ubiquitous in Spain and I'm always down for it in NYC...so we ordered: * beef empanadas * blood sausages * skirt steak sauteed with garlic * seasoned pork loin * potatoes in creamy garlic aioli sauce * potatoes in spicy tomato sauce * meat and cheese plate * spanish octopus Except for the pork loin (kinda salty), they were all fuckin deeelish. * As for dessert I didn't order any, I was already taking her home with me. ;)",1
2424,6,4,7/2/2012,"Great food! Amazing service! Festive atmosphere! I dined here for my birthday and was super happy with the overall experience! Our server, Raul was fantastic and made sure we were happy all night! The place gets a little loud so don't expect to have an intimate convo when the flamenco dancing starts. BUT if you're looking for a fun spot for dinner with great good, Nai is your spot!",1
2425,6,4,6/25/2012,"In my honest opinion, tapas are made for girls. That's why we've decided to venture here during our girls night out. It wasn't a spectacular experience but it was suitable for a catharsis. In terms of the food and drinks, here's what I had to say... Blueberry Pomegranate Sangria - First pitcher was not potent. Second pitcher hit the spot Churrasco Arriero (skirt steak sauteed with garlic and spicy cherry peppers) - Best dish but TOO well done, which made it chewy Lomo Adobado Con Pimientos Asados (seasoned pork loin with fresh roasted red peppers) - Definitely tender but lack of flavors. More gravy would be awesome Patatas Bravas (spicy potatoes gently coated with spicy house tomato sauce) - Perfectly seasoned with a mild kick. Sweetly done Patatas Alioli potatoes basted in a creamy garlic alioli sauce - Ultimately creamy but no garlic flavor. Tasted like plain mayo Mejillones Rias Baixas (galician style mussels in garlic, virgin olive oil and white wine) - Bland. Sand. Flat Pulpo A La Gallega (spanish octopus in virgin olive oil, sprinkled with sea salt and sweet paprika) - Nicely spiced but overcooked. A little texture would be great Esparragos Navarros (imported white asparagus with a minced onion and pepper vinaigrette) - Fancy but the sogginess killed the asparagus' taste With all the mentioned above, we still had room for dessert (which was what we were hoping for). This place is a little hard to find because we got misguided by the confusing Yelp (Google) map. However, the friendliness of the staff made up for it all. Will try to come back on a Thursday night to catch the live flamenco dance performance.",1
2426,6,4,6/25/2012,What to order: Red or Mango Sangria Beef Empanadas Blood Sausages Potatos in Garlic Aioli Sauace Meatballs Meat and cheese plate What not to order: Chicken and potatos Cod croquettes Garlic Shrimp Mussells Overall: Great friendly tapas spot. Lighting is semi bright contrary to other dark tapa places. The sangria is one of the best I ever had at a good price. The tapas are extremely tasty if you order the right ones. The flamingo drums during the weekends is very lively. It turns any boring date into an upbeat energetic dinner. The most notable thing about this place is the service. The staff is one of the friendliest I have ever seen and you feel right at home. I always over OVER tip at Nai.,1
2427,6,4,6/20/2012,"Went for a quick bite late on a Tuesday night and was pleasantly surprised with the speed and quality of the food. Can't miss the albondigas and the fried goat cheese over bread with serrano ham. Delicious! Make sure the bread comes, because the sauces are all worth soaking up.",1
2428,6,5,6/18/2012,"I've already been here twice in a span of a week and a half, and there's a very good reason for that. I randomly stumbled upon this place one day, when I was walking around in the East Village. What initially caught my eye, was the sign for the live flamenco dancing on Thursday and Saturday nights. A group of my friends and I decided to try it out on Thursday night, and it certainly went above and beyond in exceeding our expectations. Our waiter, Raul, was not only polite and helpful but he was also quite patient while the six of us took our time in deciding what to order. In the meantime, he made sure that our glasses remained filled with their blueberry pomegranate sangria - a great choice out of their many flavors. Plates that are a MUST HAVE: Bacalao Frito, Chorizo A La Plancha, Patatas Alioli, Empanadillas De Carne, and the Pork Tenderloin (Spanish name escapes me)...to name a few. I could go on an on but I'll end here by saying this - if you're looking for a low key spot with an intense vibe, great service and even greater food...look no further. With a friendly staff and food at an affordable price (and amazing flamenco dancers/Spanish music on Thurs and Sat)....is it any wonder why all the reviews for Nai Tapas have been nothing but amazing?",1
2429,6,5,6/8/2012,"We came (based on all the good yelp reviews), we saw (the flamenco dancing), we ate (everything!) and drank until we were merry (blueberry pomegranete champagne sangria hit the spot). It started out as a reservation for two on Thursday night. Â One more joined, followed by another, and then another and another. Â The staff were incredibly nice and kept helping us find more bar stools which was very much appreciated even though it was a packed house! Â  Â  Reminder to self: great date spot or for a lively evening to catch up with friends.",1
2430,6,5,6/6/2012,"Great service, delicious food and the sangria was perfect, not too much ice and just enough fruit! You MUST order: Gambas A La Plancha Aceitunas Rellenas Croquetas De Bacalao Croquetas De JamÃ³n SalpicÃ³n De Marisco Pulpo Vinagreta Tabla De Quesos Y Embutidos Chorizo A La Plancha Tortilla EspaÃ±ola Pinchos Morunos",1
2431,6,5,6/5/2012,"The food here is delicious. Â We ordered the following things and all were delicious. - Calamari in its own ink (very very delishious) - Empanadas - Blood Sausage - Anchovies - Garlic Shrimp Two types of sangria: - Pomegranate champagne sangria (delicious) - Red I would love to come here again, especially when they have the live dancing.",1
2432,6,4,6/1/2012,"I would give this place 4.5 stars if I could. It was really good food, great service, and I liked the restaurant's vibe. The sangria options are great, but not as strong as I would hope for. Our experience was great here and it was also decently priced.",1
2433,6,5,6/1/2012,"I love this place!!! great food, the champagne sangria is amazing and the show is really awesome def going back :-)",1
2434,6,4,5/28/2012,"Wonderful ambiance and food! Â Tapas were VERY GENEROUS as compared to the size of standards tapas and delicious! Â Highly recommend the squid cooked in it's own ink and papas alioli. Â Call in beforehand to make reservations during flamenco timeslots (one at 8:30pm and another at 10:30pm on Saturday). Â Not every table has a good view of the dance floor (which is why I rated this a 4 and not a 5), however the sound permeates throughout the restaurant (pretty loud). Â Bon apetite and enjoy the show!!",1
2435,6,4,5/28/2012,"came on a friday night. sat at the bar with friends and enjoyed some tapas and sangria. Â The drinks were awesome. Â We had a pitcher of pomegranate and a pitcher or mango. both equally delicious. Â To compare them would be to compare apples to baby wolverines. Â  The bartender was helpful when it came to which size we should order to things. The cheese and meat plate was yummy as all cheese and meat plates are, the olives were unimpressive. Â The asparagus in pink sauce i won't order again. Â It was blah. The potatoes were also meh. Â  The shrimp and the octopus on the other hand were amazing! Â I sooped up all the sauce with the bread! yum yum yum. we read that there was outside seating, but they said that they weren't seating it.... strange. hopefully next time. b/c the sangria begs to be enjoyed outside.",1
2436,6,3,5/28/2012,"Croquettes. Empanadas. Meatballs. SANGRIA!!!Etc!! Rustic, quaint, cozy. Service friendly and efficient! Enjoy :)",1
2437,6,4,5/27/2012,Great service even on a busy weekend. They are an amazing staff not just one but the whole place. The food was pretty decent not the best but definitely not lacking.,1
2438,6,4,5/22/2012,I went on a Tuesday night and it was pretty quiet. The most friendly service I've ever encountered in the city. Reminded me of why we give tips in restaurants. The food was delicious. Order yourself the -bravas (not aioli unless you like garlic) -cheese and prosciutto combo (forgot the name) -croquettes -seared steak and you got yourself a delicious meal don't forget the Mango Sangrias CAUTION: Don't get the crab crepes they suggest you. It was absolutely terrible.,1
2439,6,4,5/21/2012,"Some great food, some stuff we didn't like-the calamari and seafood tasted like nothing. Someone in my group used the word Alpo. The empanadas and cod were amazing. My boyfriend wants to return just for them. Our waitress was extremely sweet and accommodating-even with our group of 7. Sangria was great, and they had mango and a pomegranate option. The flamenco show was good for something different, but became almost too loud Â as we were seated right next to the stage. The price is great and came out to about 65 pp with a twenty percent tip. Glad I tried it out.",1
1936,6,5,5/16/2012,"I love this place! The sangria is magical, the food is very tasty and at a great price. The bartender was awesome to talk to as we were sitting at the bar drinking sangria and eating our tapas. Def worth sneaking in this cozy little joint!",1
2440,6,2,5/12/2012,I really don't get the hype for this place. The ambiance is by no means exciting and the food really isn't all that spectacular.,1
2441,6,3,5/9/2012,"Came here for a bday with 3 friends on a Friday night, with a reservation. Place was crowded but not overly packed, but service was still really sub-par. It was on the later side, but still. - Out of most of the things we wanted - Took FOREVER to get drinks, service, etc. - Waiter acted like he was doing us a favor by seating us Food was good, not great. Portions were fine, not amazing. Price was so-so. Village-esque place in terms of layout/decor. Wouldn't refuse to go back, but def not on my list of fav places.",1
2442,6,5,5/9/2012,"I came here with 3 others on a Saturday evening without a reservation, about 7pm-so right about prime time. The staff did their best to accommodate us--since we weren't sure if we would be able to make it out before all the 8pm reservations, they let us sit together at the bar, and we still go to watch the Flamenco show! Â That was a really special treat. The bartender was really nice to us, which I appreciated. I had the garlic shrimp which was just great--I LOVE garlic. My husband got the crab crepes. Â I didn't have any sangria but I was impressed that they had a huge bin of fresh fruit right on the bar, she'd scoop some into a glass before tapping the sangria. So if you're into that--you really need to try this place.",1
2443,6,4,5/7/2012,"Really fun place! Â Food is only 3 stars - good but nothing special. Â However, the sangria and flamenco are really fun! Â It's a good spot that's not too fancy but a great place to spend an evening. Â There are also lots of great bars and dessert places nearby to walk to afterwards.",1
2444,6,4,5/6/2012,"The staff was really friendly! We got half a pitcher of mango sangria. It was delicious but a bit expensive for $16. But I learned that if you go Mon-Wed they have full pitchers for $20. The food was good. We ordered 4 dishes and dessert. Our favorite was the garlic potatoes. Next time, i want to get 5 plates of that. So delicious! The grilled chorizo was good. But I would not recommend the crab stuffed crepes or the pork cutlet dishes (sorry, i don't remember the exact names). We got the creme brulee to share and it was heavenly. I deducted a star because it was really loud in side. While I enjoyed the entertainment (a lot!) they could've turned the volume down just a tad. At the end of the meal we were stuffed and all for about $40! Overall, my bf and I enjoyed it and would go there again.",1
1875,6,3,5/4/2012,"This place is a solid 3 stars. If their sangria was a bit stronger and more natural tasting, I would be happy to bump the ratings up to a 4. Paul H. took me here to begin our night of feasting. We got some potata bravas, mussels, and croquettes. The food was really good Â but it did take a little while to come out. I honestly think the waiter forgot one of our dishes and didn't bring it out until we reminded him. It's ok, he was really nice and helpful. The ambiance here is really fun and inviting. I noticed a band was setting up so they must have live music playing here on some nights.",1
2445,6,5,5/2/2012,Absolutely delicious. Great ambiance and can usually make reservations on the weekends.,1
2446,6,2,4/29/2012,"I think the only reason why I'm giving this place a 2-star rating is because I'm comparing Nai Tapas to the various tapas places I went to in Barcelona a month ago. Sorry, Nai Tapas. You're competing with the big boys here. For someone who hasn't had authentic tapas, I'm sure Nai Tapas would be perfectly adequate. They have a relatively wide menu, and tapas plates cost about $6 to $7. The dishes that I got, though, were quite lacking. I tried the beef empanadas, lightly fried codfish, jamon platter and blood sausage on toast. Everything came off to me as either old, or freezer-ed. The empanadas tasted like they came out of a box, the ham had an off taste to it, the codfish was a little overdone, and the blood sausage was served very in a very unwieldy fashion. The champagne sangria was good, though. Get that. It's happy hour up till 7 pm even on Fridays.",1
2447,6,3,4/26/2012,"I have mixed feelings. On the one hand, the venue was fun, they took (and fulfilled) a reservation, and they had good drinks (sangria, beer, the like). On the other, I didn't find the food mind-blowingly spectacular. For instance, the manchego/prosciutto platter was DELICIOUS and I kept going back for more. But the asparagus was mushy. Sure, it was out of season, but take it off the menu please? I could probably eat the patatas bravas for days, but the octopus was... mushy. Hmm... sensing a theme. Anyway, they still get 3 stars for the atmosphere (dark, loud, PARTY!) and for the fact that they take reservations. Definitely stashing it away in my list of places for groups!",1
2448,6,4,4/22/2012,"Literally just finished eating here just 2 hours ago and I am so happy! Service was incredibly great; maybe it was the rain or maybe it was a Sunday night but the the wait staff was super attentive. Â They provided great recommendations and the food came out quick. 1. Croquettas Bacalao - the best I have ever had. Â Not overly salty or fishy taste. Â So yum! I could have had all 3 to myself. 2. Gambas Al Ajilla - this dish was ok. Â I have definitely had it better elsewhere in terms of how savory the sauce was. Â But for a staple dish, it was definitely worth having. 3. Crepes with Crabmeat - could have skipped this dish 4. Grilled Chorizo - need I say more? Yum! 5. Jamon y Queso - generous portion of serrano ham and manchego cheese. a definite get. 6. Patatas Bravas - we asked for a side of alioli sauce and mixed it together for a heavenly flavor 7. Pork Tenderloin in Orange Sauce - very nice dish but was it wasnt memorable enough to have again. Great tapas place! Highly recommend anyone to try for a yummy meal with generous seating for you and your friends.",1
966,6,4,4/22/2012,"Had no clue about this place, so thank you to the friend that introduced me to it! Â At first I thought it wasn't going to be very good because their tapas list was a mile long. Â They seriously have every variety of tapas under the sun and then some. Â How can they possibly be good at making everything?? Â But at least for the ones I got, they were good! Â Now I'm intrigued by this flamenco night thing that everyone is raving abt.",1
2449,6,4,4/22/2012,"Good tapas and sangria, especially the meatballs and shrimp. The grilled octopus was too mushy for my taste. Service can be slow when the restaurant gets packed. Pretty inexpensive for the quality.",1
2450,6,4,4/21/2012,"I came here with a date who picked this place based on reviews and his love for tapas. After reading the Yelp! reviews I was really excited to try the food and the sangria here. First things first, the service here is GREAT and super accommodating. Even though my date was smart enough to make a reservation at 7:45pm, I was STILL late and showed up at 8:05pm. I blame the traffic on 10th street. The service staff was totally understanding and even joked around while walking us to our table, saying that it was my job to be fashionably late. (whew!) Next comes the sangria... we ordered a pitcher of red sangria to be split between the two of us. I've never seen such skillful pouring as demonstrated by our server. I took a quick peek at the fruit in the pitcher; mostly apples so I was a tad disappointed. Usually red sangrias have more variety of fruit, but it was incredibly delicious nonetheless. It was sweet without being too sweet. Tart without being too tart. As for the tapas, I had the following: 1) Pan Tumaca (toast with tomato, serrano ham, manchego cheese) 2) EspÃ¡rragos Navarros (imported white asparagus with onion & pepper vinaigrette) 3) Gambas Al Ajillo (grilled shrimp in garlic sauce) 4) Pinchos Morunos (marinated grilled pork skewers) For dessert, we split the lava fudge cake a la mode. These four tapas, a desert, plus half a pitcher of sangria were enough to fill me up! I'd definitely come back here again for dates, with a friend, or even with a large group. When a group of 15-20 girls walked in the staff swiftly maneuvered a few tables around without disrupting the meals of other patrons. By the way, this place is a bit difficult to locate. It's located next to a bakery, and rather than being at sidewalk level, you have to walk down into the restaurant.",1
2451,6,3,4/20/2012,"The service and space are great but the food is just ok. Based on the food alone I'd give it 2 stars because nothing was memorable but the service was really excellent. The sangria was tasty but that's probably because they used grape juice. I'm a lightweight and it did nothing for me, even after 3 glasses.",1
2452,6,4,4/18/2012,Good food,1
2453,6,5,4/16/2012,"I've been coming here since the beginning and love it more every time I go ..the food is super tasty, the flamenco is tons of fun and the staff is friendly and attentive even when they are packed. champagne sangria is my drink of choice (although they Â all are delish) and you can't go wrong with any of the tapas. Â One of my favorite places to eat and drink in the city. :)",1
2454,6,5,4/14/2012,"Awesome all around! Friendly staff, happy hour til 7pm and accommodates groups!! Food is delicious and the sangria is fabulous. Just a note to make sure your friends are not super late because on a friday night you have to give up your table after two hours (BUT they told us this at the beginning of dinner and still let us stay an extra 45 minutes since our group couldn't get our shit together). Such nice folks. I was really so impressed by this place, a new favorite!",1
2455,6,4,4/13/2012,"3rd time's the charm at this happening place. Each time I attend, it gets busier and busier but RSVPS are still welcome (and encouraged!). Â Going to keep this short since this is my 3rd update but came here for my bday dinner and the food and service was excellent as usual (read my prior reviews- I already wrote 2!). But, the new thing for me this time was the Flamenco dancing. Â Ask for the exact times on Saturdays but the live music, band, singers, clappers, and the dancers made it for an authentic night out. Â As a friend pointed out, these people are professional clappers (how do their hands not hurt from clapping to the beat?). Love this place. Great service as usual which only enhances the experience even further.",1
2456,6,5,4/9/2012,"What a great find this place is. Â Our friends made early reservations for us, as we were attending a concert later. Â A high chair for their baby was already in place when we arrived. Â We ordered an extensive selection of tapas and larger portions, as well as a pitcher and a half of their terrific pomegranate champagne sangria. Â The food came out in waves, so we would be finishing 1-2 items by the time the next round arrived. Â Basically everything we ordered was a winner - meatballs, jamon, the usual tapas etc. -- all nicely done. The baby even ate some octopus! Â The service was so attentive and thoughtful. Â And we could not believe how tiny the bill was, considering everything we ordered - an incredible value for the money. Â We left just as the Flamenco was being set up, so that entails a return trip. Â All in all, a must the next time we are in the neighborhood.",1
2457,6,5,4/9/2012,"I made a reservation for my birthday 2 weeks prior and it was easy. Â  I had a blast that night (past saturday). Waiters are very helpful, friendly and the Flamengo show is fantastic!! I can't find any bad thing about this restaurant - excellent service, delicious food, very reasonable price and wonderful performance!",1
2458,6,4,4/8/2012,"I had one of the most pleasant dining experiences at Nai Tapas Bar. First off, let me rave about how awesome it is that a Tapas Bar in New York actually takes reservations.. (GASP! Â Unheard of! Â Do you know how many times I've waited 1 hour plus because tapas restaurants are usually super small and super happening?) Â Then, a couple days before, I called to see if I could update my reservation from 8 to 10. Â The person who answered the phone was so nice, friendly, and accommodating, it was refreshing to talk to them. Then, on the day of, the same person called me to confirm, but he did so in a very friendly and welcoming way. Â I already felt like I was going to like this place a lot. And, it didn't disappoint. Â The whole staff at Nai's was amazing. Â They were patient with our huge group, and brought us drinks, bread, and really took good care of us. Â We had an all ice cream cake, and although they didn't have a freezer, they were able to ask the bakery next door if they could use theirs. Â We showed our appreciation by sharing some of our Chinatown Ice Cream Factory Lychee, Mango, and Black Sesame ice cream cake with them. The food was so good. Â I highly recommend the ham croquettas, the mussels ( that sauce was amazing with bread), the steak, the heart of palm salad, the octopus (which had a creamy texture), chicken with potatoes, the sausage wrapped with potato, and the fried cod. ( YUMMMM ) For drinks, we had 2 pitchers of the Red Sangria, which was delicious. Â They also had some drinks I had never tried before like beer with seven up, and red wine with coke. Â Pretty interesting. On top of it, on Wed and Saturdays they have a guitarist playing Spanish music and a live Flamenco Show. Â It was really entertaining and really added to the whole experience that night. Â The dancers were passionate and it was a beautiful, emotional performance that we all really enjoyed. The restaurant itself is small, but I didn't feel cramped or crowded. Â It was just loud enough to have a good ambiance, but not so loud that I couldn't hear my friends. Â I highly recommend this place if you like Tapas.",1
2459,6,4,4/8/2012,"Great ambiance and food. Mango Sangria is a must. Some highlights include the Albondiguillas Estofadas (meatballs with brandy sauce), Crepes stuffed with crab meat, and Churrasco Arriero. The Churrasco Arriero was our favorite dish, the skirt steak was perfectly cooked and was accompanied by the most delicious sauce made of garlic and cherry peppers. Service was friendly and attentive. Make sure to make reservations for the live flamenco at 8:30 pm on Thursdays and Saturdays.",1
1959,6,4,4/8/2012,"My girlfriend and I came here for dinner early last weekend - we hadn't made a reservation, and we figured that it'd be easier to get a seat than later, when it gets a bit crowded. There were a few parties seated at 6 PM, but nothing too bad, so getting seated was a cinch. It's a bit dark in the interior, but getting one of the tables by the window was money - the natural lighting helps the mood quite a bit. Service was quick, and the tapas came out one by one, so we were never left pondering when the next dish was coming out. The food itself was delicious overall, although I wouldn't put the overall quality at a 5-star level. Certain dishes were extremely well-done; my favorites had to be the croquettes, which blended melt-in-your-mouth potatoes with succulent cod, and the mussels, which worked extremely well with the paprika sauce. It gave it a bit of a kick that a regular tomato-based broth for this dish wouldn't give, but it wasn't too spicy to overpower the other flavors. The cured meats with cheese was also delicious; I don't remember the exact meats or cheeses, but they were all very good. Unfortunately, the other dishes were a bit forgettable. I don't remember these as well, but the chicken meatballs were delicious and very tender as well. The crepes with crab meat sounds like an interesting and unique concept, but the crab meat was nowhere close to what you get in fresh crab cakes, and the sauce that was drizzled on top of the crepes didn't really do much for me. I've had delicious tortillas in Spain and at Soccorat, but the one here really didn't do much for me. It was too potato-y, and I didn't really get a good taste of the sausage (which was allegedly in the dish). This is a different style of tapas than I've had previously, but it was still pretty delicious overall. You probably can order 2-3 per person and have a meal worth sharing amongst everyone. I'd come back to try some of the other items; most of them are absolutely delicious, while some are just average.",1
2460,6,4,4/4/2012,"Food is yummy and the sangrias are divine. The wait staff is extremely helpful and awesome, honestly. They were so attentive and I experienced the best service.",1
2461,6,4,4/4/2012,"I went there on a Tuesday night, so no, there was no flamenco show, but its ok, I can always come back. Of course you gotta start off your meal with the most important thing, sangria. They had a few different types of sangria- red, white, mango, tropical, champagne etc. The waiter said that the most popular flavors were the red or mango. I ordered the red sangria. I wished it was sweeter and fruitier. Food wise, it was excellent. There are 2 sizes for the tapas: tapas and racion. Racion is bigger. For a table of 4 people, they recommended ordering either 4 racionnes or 6 tapas. We decided to do a combination. EspÃ¡rragos Navarros - asparagus in olive oil, it was pretty good. Tortilla Vegetariana- delicious! Good size as well. Calamares Fritos - you can't really go wrong with deep fried calarami Patatas Bravas - I love this dish! Bacalao Frito - Deep fried cod fish. Each chunk wasn't that big, and you could dip it in some sauces that resembled tar tar sauce. Croquetas De Pollo - yummy. The waiters here are all Spanish and quite helpful. I forgot to mention that they give you a bread basket at the beginning of the meal but the bread was cold and chewy.",1
2462,6,4,3/31/2012,"I was really looking forward to checking out this spanish tapas restaurant, I've been slowly trying to hit up all the tapas restaurants in Manhattan. Nai tapas didn't disappoint, the waiters, mostly all spanish were very lively and provided a great service. I must say, the chicken and jamon croquetas were amazing, so were the chorrizo wraps and the aceitunas. The sangria was great, not as good as the one you can get back in Spain but it still made a great compliment to the dinner. Nai Tapas is great for any occasion, whether you are a big group or just on a date, they will be able to rapidly accomodate you. Great restaurant and highly recommended!",1
2463,6,4,3/29/2012,"Mmmm tapas. This restaurant has a wonderful atmostphere. If you come for the live flamenco, take note that it gets loud. If you're near the action, you will be shouting at your date! That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Food and drink were fairly standard and nothing to write home about. Service was warm and swift. I'll return for the entertainment :)",1
2464,6,3,3/29/2012,"I'm not sure why this place is getting such rave reviews. I came here last week with my boyfriend for a casual Thursday night dinner. We were seated right away and immediately ordered a wide selection of their tapas- meatballs, mussels, olives, some fried chicken monstrosity- and a large pitcher of sangria. Overall, the service was good and the ambiance was nice- but the food was mediocre at best. One of the mussels I had was rotten which totally threw me off. Nothing ruins a meal faster than rotten shellfish. Nai seems like its great for bar fare and sangria but not much else. The prices are great, but the food is not.",1
2465,6,5,3/28/2012,"This place is amazing for so many reasons, namely the Flamenco. A must do on Thursdays and Saturdays at 8:00PM. The show is the real deal and it never gets old. Wanna impress a date? Friends in town? Just want a classic unexpected NY experience? Make a reservation, AND get there early,they get packed for good reason. The food is decent--your standard tapas at a tapas price. But you're going for the Flamenco, it trumps everything. Beyond the show the staff is wonderful. Attentive, good energy, down to earth, most of them Spanish from Spain. Just go. You won't be disappointed.",1
2466,6,5,3/26/2012,"This place is fantastic. Â I went here this past Friday with my friend from out of town and husband. Â It was so tasty, the food was fresh, the manager/owner David was so friendly, and it was reasonably priced. Â We had garlic potatoes, sausage, the omelet, shrimp, and squid. Â So, so good! Â I will be going back soon.",1
2467,6,4,3/26/2012,Really enjoyed myself! I'm allergic to shellfish but still felt there were plenty of yummy options. My group took a while to get behind the sharing bit cause we all really liked what we ordered. But highlights for me were the patatas bravas and the patatas in alioli (sp) as well as the meatballs in brandy sauce! Don't let them fool you into thinking the patatas bravas are hot- they were just tasty. I could have eaten just potatoes and meatballs and been perfectly happy. The drinks looked good too-though I wasn't partaking this particular evening. Service was very friendly and they described anything we had questions about as well as letting two of my friends try two different wines and then decide what they wanted. I feel like a lot of places don't do that anymore. We made a reservation so our party of 5 had no problems getting in. I'd suggest making one if you know you want to head there-it did fill up pretty quickly once we were seated around 730. Definitely seems like a later night dinner kind of place. I think it would be fun for a group or for a nice date!,1
2468,6,4,3/26/2012,"Interesting tapas options and an intimate setting. Water boy was almost too attentive, and the waiter kept bringing out more drinks even after we said we were all set. Thankfully he left those off the bill.",1
2469,6,4,3/25/2012,"Soo....Im kind of a hot head. We were running late with some out of town friends, about 30 mins late. By the time we arrived, they gave away our table.Totally understandable but as a hot head I didnt give the best face and was visibly annoyed. Even though I gave a complete sh*t face he managed to get us a table. WOW. That was above and beyond. I appreciated very much that he accommodated us even though he didnt have to. Definitely recommend. The food is great- my guest were veryyyy happy! Especially with the croquettes! The sangria couldve been stonger though... The flamenco show is great! in between they played some of my favs: Enrique Iglesias, Carlos Vives, Julieta Venegas, and Manu Chao. Overall I recommend, especially after putting up with Â my sh*t face for being late to my own reservation! :)",1
2470,6,4,3/25/2012,"This place is great. Great food, great drinks, and great service. On a Saturday night they also had great live music. This is up there as one of my favorites in the city now.",1
2471,6,5,3/23/2012,short and to the point. Â Amazing experience. Â Raul was great! Recommended several tapas and did not oversell. Â Good atmosphere and had no wait. Â Reservation was honored and would high endorse the experience!!,1
2472,6,5,3/22/2012,"Just go. You will not be sorry. I haven't been to a place that bent over backwards to make everyone happy like this maybe ever. We were a group of eight and they catered to our every whim + more. The food was incredible, they let me try wines until I found one that was perfect, sangria (esp red) was a huge hit! We were there on a Saturday night - live flamenco. I've been to many flamenco shows in Spain and these dancers were top notch and so passionate. Really incredible night - thanks so much!",1
2473,6,4,3/20/2012,"The mango sangria is really good but might be a bit watered down. The most memorable dishes were the clams, mussels and meatballs. All of them were really good. Stay away from the octopus and asparagus. The octopus was slimy and the asparagus was soggy! Kinda gross.",1
2474,6,4,3/16/2012,"This place is very delicious, if you're in the area(and even if you're not) you should try it! I went with my friend and we split a pitcher of sangria, beef empanadas, pork skewers, calamari, mussels, and an almond tart. Everything was great. The waiters were friendly and attentive, and we ended up staying long after our meal was done to finish our sangria (and nobody was hovering over us to see if we were finished). The only reason I gave it a 4 as opposed to a 5 is because all of this together was $30 a person, and I don't think it was filling enough to be that much. But hey, everything else was great, and the sangria was especially delicious, so I'd say it was worth it in the end.",1
2475,6,4,3/14/2012,"Went to Nai after seeing good Â Yelp reviews and craving tapas and sangria. Â Went on a Tuesday night with three friends. Â We ordered two or three small tapas each to share for the table and two pitchers of sangria, red and champagne. Â Both sangrias weren't that great. Â The champagne sangria was the worse of the two. Â Both were too sweet, but at $20 a pitcher, I can deal. THE FOOD WAS SPECTACULAR and came in two rounds, which was nice. Croquettes, potatoes, tortilla espaÃ±ola, calamari... Unreal. Gave it 4 stars for the overly sweet and watery (but $20!) sangria and because it was almost empty on a Tuesday, making the experience a little awkward. But I'd go back for the food. OMG.",1
2476,6,2,3/11/2012,"We had reservations for 10pm which was not honored. Â We had to wait an hour before we realized we are not getting a table. Â The host said he couldn't do anything about it, which was quite disappointing.",1
2477,6,4,3/11/2012,Funfunfun. Casual with great sangria. Yummy tapas. Felt like I was back in Spain. Flamenco dancers and music a bonus.,1
2478,6,4,3/11/2012,This is such a cute little spot. I didn't eat here so I can't review that area but I did drink here. There was a group of five of us. We came here and shared two pitchers of sangria. We got a regular flavor and blueberry sangria. It was amazing! The service was really good and it was so cheap. They also have free live entertainment. There is just one thing: this is not the place to come with a LARGE group. It's really small in here. I really want to come back here one day to try their food!,1
2479,6,4,3/7/2012,"Very impressive selection of great tapas. Great music, great sangria and moderate prices. Â Oh, and live Flamenco on Thursdays and Saturdays. Everything you need from any tapas place, and mucho mas. Awesome.",1
2480,6,5,3/6/2012,"Nai's Tapas is an experience that you share with family and dear friends. The food is delicious, but the sangria and the hospitable atmosphere is what really makes this east side eatery a great experience. I have been here about 10+ times and I am treated wonderfully each time. The crew is very warm and they make sure your cup is full of sangria all the time! You have to treat yourself.",1
2481,6,5,3/5/2012,"I am in LOVE with Nai! The service is top notch and I have nothing bad whatsoever to say about them. Their tapas are cheap and delicious. I love that most of their tapas are only $5- $7, which means you can order a couple to try. I really recommend their Garlic Potatoes and Croquettes. Both of these dishes were my favorites of the night.",1
2482,6,5,3/4/2012,"Nai Tapas Bar is great, everything from the ambiance to the food. Pitchers of Sangria range from $16-20, depending on what you get and tastes amazing! The food comes tapas style - the small plates are about $6 on average and $10 for the larger plates. Â Both of which are rather reasonable and very very tasty! The only bad part is the place is rather small, so if you do go you should make a reservation. Â I went on a Wednesday night around 7 PM with no reservations and my friends and I had to wait a while. Â Luckily there was some space at the bar for us to sit and wait. Â We got a few appetizers there to start off before we got some seats. Â The bar tender was very nice and very helpful. What's great is they do not try to push or rush you out, My friends and I were there for a while (maybe 4 hours) - ordering drinks and tapas!",1
1876,6,4,3/3/2012,"I came here based off a colleague's recommendation. Decor: 3/5 -Not much seating. Seating capacity is around 50 Service: 3.5/5 -Friendly service. -Total wait time was 25 minutes for the bar -Due to reservations, walk-ins will need to be patient Food: 3/5 -Mejillones avoa: mussels in paprika wine sauce. My favorite dish of the night because of the light yet flavorful broth. You get between 20-30 small mussels. -Empanadillas de Cazue: beef turnovers. This reminded me of a Jamaican beef patty. You get two. -Tortilla Espanola: traditional Spanish omelet with onions & potatoes. Sadly the omelet was bland and needed Tabasco sauce. I also used the paprika wine sauce to add flavor to the omelet. -Pinchos Morunos: marinated grilled pork skewers. This was my second favorite dish. You get one skewer with five cubes of pork. The pork was borderline to being overcooked. Other than that, the marinade tasted great. I'm definitely coming back but I'm giving Nai 3.5 star for now.",1
2483,6,5,2/29/2012,"I can't say enough about my experience at Nai Tapas. A group of friends and I came here on Valentine's Day and the staff really went above and beyond to serve us. We were seated at a high top table, as most of the other tables in the back were taken by dates. Our server was laid back and knowledgeable and recommended how many and which tapas we should order. The food was delicious and everything came out right away. We ordered probably 20 different tapas and quite a few pitchers of white sangria. The standouts were the ham croquettes, the meatballs and the patatas bravas. I didn't eat any of the fish dishes, but apparently those were very good as well. However, what really stood out in my mind was that our waiter accidentally brought an extra tapa that we didn't order. We pointed out to him that we didn't order it and hadn't touched it yet, so he could just bring it back. He told us to keep the dish and that it was on the house. He then brought over a whole PITCHER of white sangria and told us that it was on the house as well to apologize for the mistake. The whole meal ended up costing around $35 dollars each with tip and alcohol! I have never seen this kind of service in New York, let alone in a restaurant that isn't incredibly upscale such as this. I would recommend Nai Tapas to any of my friends for it's good food, reasonable prices, laid back, unpretentious atmosphere and outstanding service.",1
2484,6,5,2/26/2012,"Amazing atmosphere... Went there for dinner w/ my boyfriend on a sat. nite. We had a reservation for 10.15pm and we got a cute table right next to the performers! I really enjoyed the show - the performers passion was almost touchable and it filled the small busy space! In terns of food, the seafood platter was great (octopus was amazing)! Other things, the shrimp in garlic sauce was great! Highly recommend this spot!",1
2485,6,5,2/16/2012,"Best Spanish restaurant in NYC. Ambiance, Food, Hospitality, Food & Prices its all there. Make sure to go on flamenco nights, performance is amazing their selection of Spanish beers and food is right on the spot. I could go on writing about how good the place it is but you should go and experience it yourself!",1
2486,6,4,2/15/2012,A pretty good place to go to for dates as well. Something I didn't know before (which I should have) is that they have live Flamenco on Thursdays and Saturdays.. Definitely a place to try,1
2487,6,4,2/12/2012,"The pros: - Not too crowded - easy to get reservations for Fri/Sat - Excellent ambiance - Great flamenco show - Meatballs and croquets were very good The cons: - The octopus was overcooked and very bland - Several items were not available on the menu - The dessert list consisted only of an almond tart and 2 types of ice cream in the middle of February... Â the two cake options they did not have on hand (they did give us the almond tart for free, but it was pretty mediocre at best) Overall, I give the restaurant 4 starts because of the great atmosphere and great performers. Â It's a fun place to go with a group of 4-8 or a birthday.",1
2488,6,3,2/8/2012,"Pretty good place for girls night dinner. Relatively empty at 7:30, but by 8:30 it was quite full. You can either choose to get tapas or racion (a normal portion). It was recommended you get 2-3 tapas a person. Â I think it would even be safe to go with 3 tapas a person even. Nothing ""wowed"" me, they were all decent enough dishes though. One dish I would recommend skipping would be the escargot. Â Never knew escargot could be bland, but it was here. Definitely order sangria. Â Not sure if it is every night, or just Wednesdays, but it was $20 a pitcher. Â $16 for half a pitcher. You do the math. Strongly recommend the blue pomegranite champagne one and strongly do NOT recommend the mango one. Service was really good. Â Our waitress checked up on us quite a few times and walked into numerous heated debates about inappropriate subjects that we should not be having in a restaurant...but at least she cared!",1
2489,6,5,2/3/2012,"Awesome little spot. I took my girl here for her birthday dinner and we both loved it. Granted, it was a Monday so the place wasn't packed, but that said: Service: 5/5: Excellent, warm, welcoming. The server took his time with us to explain dishes, make recommendations, and answer questions. Â At one point they brought out an extra dish due to a miscommunication while ordering and when I mentioned it, they immediately apologized and said ti was on the house. Food: 5/5: Everything was flavorful and delicious. We had the - skirt steak: tender, good-sized portion - stewed meatballs: the meatballs and the brandy sauce were each great on their own, amazing together - white asparagus: very soft and tasty, but it only comes with 2 pieces - Spanish octopus in EVOO: AMAZING. They boil the octopus instead of grilling it, giving it a very soft, tender texture (like very tender abolone or scallop, instead of chewy like calamari). It melted like butter in your mouth. - mixed seafood in cider & olive oil: Good dish, but the octopus in this dish was more chewy and similar to the usual texture I expect from octopus - Red sangria: did the trick, was $20 for a pitcher (I think it was a special that night), they also have 4 other flavors Ambience: 4/5: One side has all exposed brick, representative of NYC. The other is painted with a Spanish-themes motif. Â Multiple little tables with plenty of elbow room. Good music (mix of spanish guitar and various other sounds with Latin roots, I heard 3 Manu Chao songs during our dinner). Price: 4.5/5: Â Not bad, as far as tapas go. All in all, a cute little tapas spot with great food, service, and atmosphere for a very reasonable price in a great location. Will definitely return, I had no complaints.",1
2490,6,4,1/31/2012,"Everything was delicious but I highly recommend the meatballs in brandy sauce. I could go on and on about the dishes but there's no point. Just go and order, you won't be sorry. The service was amazing...it's rare when I do a shout out on service, in fact, that's my biggest issue with restaurants, but Uno was so great I have to write about him. From making sure out water was filled, to checking in on us and having a charismatic energy and personality. We throughly enjoyed his service! I'm pretty sure the food could have been awful but we would have left happy because of him! But the combo of amazing tapas, $20 pitcher of sangria and excellent service made me a fan and a repeat patron.",1
1879,6,3,1/24/2012,"I really wish I could give Nai a half star, because it's right between 3 and 4! The atmosphere, drinks, and service are all great, but the food left something to be desired. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. Our waiter was super friendly and kept bringing us free pitchers of sangria.",1
2491,6,5,1/24/2012,"I came here on a Monday around 6, and the place was completely empty. Based on the high yelp reviews, we had been anticipating excellent food and service for weeks! We tried the patatas bravas (spicy and excellent), beef empanadillas (unique - had olives and raisins, very tasty), albondiguillas (delicous), cod croquetas (least favorite - good taste, but the filling was mushy), shrimp with garlic sauce (the bf said they were delicious, but I didn't try them), and grilled chorizo (pretty good). All servings are moderately-sized and well worth the money. We came during happy hour (lasts until 8?) and got a 1/2 pitcher of red sangria for $10. The half pitcher was about 4-5 (small-ish) wine glasses and very flavorful, though they don't soak their fruit in alcohol or wine before serving. I tasted :) The total for both of us before tip was $40. I will definitely be back!",1
2492,6,3,1/24/2012,"Came here with a group of 7 people. Pluses: The space/ambiance was accommodating, the service was friendly, and our bill was extremely reasonable -- we ate a lot of tapas and drank a lot of sangria over two hours, and the total was under $40/person. Minuses: None of the tapas were particularly standout, and most were pretty meh. Also, most tapas came in plates of 6, which was awkward to share among 7 people. Â Some restaurants will figure out a way to accomodate groups like ours in those circumstances, which would have been nice. Â Lastly, the flamenco show went on *way* too long and was much too loud. It was fun for a the first few minutes, but we all had to leave after it went on 30 minutes -- conversation was impossible over the noise, our ears were ringing. And really, it's not that exciting to watch someone click their fingers and stomp around to a guitar for more than a song or two.",1
2493,6,5,1/23/2012,"Wow. We walked in and were lucky enough to get a table immediately even without a reservation. It turned out to be one of those amazing nights when everything went right. Nai had the perfect mix of atmosphere, great tastes, and great company. The had great unique and affordable tapas plates, decently cheap wine, and live dancing. My date and I split 5 dishes and a bottle of wine. We were both stuffed by the end of the meal. Two great dishes that I really enjoyed were the Octopus (grilled, not fried), and the meatballs. The service was amazing and very comfortable. The music and dancing can be quite loud, so it might not be the best place for a chatty dinner.",1
2494,6,5,1/21/2012,"Nai ay ay. Where do I begin with this place? Â Maybe file this under ""Places I don't want to give a good review so people don't saturate it, but it'd be a crime not to""? Â  The food is just traditional Spanish comfort food done correctly- light and fresh-tasting- no more, no less. Â No crazy re-inventions, no pentagonal plates the size of half your table with a bite of food in the center, no molecular gastronomy. Â But there's certainly a huge place in my heart for traditional food done right without smoke and lights. Â The octopus (pulpo a la gallega) was the best I've had in an NYC Spanish restaurant; so tender, not chewy and well-seasoned. Â The tortilla espan~ola was tasty but kinda dry. Â We asked our waiter for some kind of sauce and he brought us an aioli and this amazingly refreshing and tasty tomato-based sauce. Â Both just elevated the yum factor exponentiallly, so it would have been ideal if the dish came with these sauces to begin with. Â The meatballs were great; so soft and tender. Â The flavor of the meat was good, but elevated to ""PFFFF OMG WTF"" by spooning over they brandy sauce it come in. Â The cod fish croquetas were spectacular; a soft fried volcano of cheesy deliciousness with the nice contrasting saltiness of the fish. Â Finally, for dessert (which I usually skip but the prices are really good and figured the rest of the good was so good, might as well try it), got the tarta de santiago, which our Spanish waiter advertised as ""just like my mom made at home""....and well, all I can say is that I deeply envy our waiter's childhood food. My thing about NTB is that although the food is great, the most important that is that it reminds me of what dining out in NYC is supposed to be, but sadly (at least in my experiences) is not often enough the case. Â So many times, in this crazy city, we get plowed into restaurants like herds of credit card-wielding, too lazy to cook, want to impress my date stupidheads. Â So we go, are made to wait for a table despite having a reservation, get more of a forced grit of the teeth rather than a smile, get our food, shovel it down, pay and GTFO so the restaurant can repeat. Â This has been so common for me that I stopped caring about eating out and took up cooking in earnest....until...until NTB made me believe in eating out in NYC again. Â  The whole wait staff (incl. bus boys) was awesome. Â It really felt like we had made a good six friends by the end of the night. Â The flamenco music/dancing to which past reviewers have alluded is amazing and, on its own merit, worth going to NTB. Â And then even when the performers are taking a break, the restaurant plays good Spanish rock (which, if you're not a fan, is like if GnR, Bon Jovi, etc. had Mexican cousins). Â  And we were not even rushed in the slightest while we downed wine and chatted with the staff. Â I have never raved on and on about my dining experience so much after a meal....so much that I'm pretty sure my girlfriend contemplated ditching me between 1st Avenue to Union Square just so I would finally STFU about it.",1
2495,6,5,1/19/2012,"Heck yes. Went here on a date and it was great. It was a little hidden, so it took a minute to find. Really glad we did though. Started off with an Estrella (because it was on tap, and it is a Spanish restaurant after all), then moved (begrudgingly) to sangria. It was really good, even though it is winter time. For dinner we shared several plates. We started off with a plate of assorted meats and cheeses (Una Tabla de Quesos Y Embutidos). These were varied and interesting, definitely a good place to start. Next we had the octopus (Pulpo A La Gallega), and it was stunning. The octopus was velvety, and perfectly seasoned. Get it! Last we had the meatballs (Albondiguillas Estofadas), and they were delicious. You are probably thinking, ""Meatballs? Really?"" But don't think, just do. The sauce was tasty (make sure you have some bread). I will definitely be back, hopefully on a night when they have flamenco.",1
2496,6,3,1/18/2012,"i was excited about nai and while they delivered on being a tapas bar, nothing really stood out as extraordinary. octopus salad was good - octopus was cooked more well done than i'd like but not rubbery. tomato, ham, and manchego bread met expectations little meatballs were perfect appetizer size, mediocre on taste patatas bravas were odd. Â rather than the usual pepper sauce, the sauce tasted more like siracha.",1
2497,6,4,1/18/2012,"The service was excellent, the food was quite good (especially the mussels and chorizo with onions)... The mango sangria was deceptively light, but gave a nice buzz. Overall, I would go again!",1
2498,6,5,1/18/2012,"Traditional tapas and red wine with a side of live flamenco? Â Yes, please. I went to Nai Tapas with my date on Saturday night without a reservation, and was seated immediately. Â Although the restaurant seems small from the outside (it's half underground), the space is sizable with many tables and quite a few bar seats. Â The tapas were rich and flavorful morsels - my date's favorite was the grilled octopus in olive oil, and mine was the garlic sauteed shrimp. We were impressed with the long menu - many options came in smaller tapas servings ($5-10) and in larger portions as well (more like $10-15). Â We were full and happy after 5 tapas-sized dishes and a bottle of wine. Â The best part was the flamenco band in between courses (!)... I'm not sure if that's a weekly performance, but it definitely should be. Â This is one of those places that's great for a date night but would also be fun for drinks and food with a larger group of friends.",1
2499,6,4,1/17/2012,We really enjoyed this restaurant. Â The food was fresh and tasty and the service was excellent. Â Our waiter made very good suggestions as to what and how much to order. Â I would definitely go back.,1
2500,6,2,1/11/2012,"I recently dined at Nai with a large group (20+). Based on reviews, it seemed like the restaurant would be able to accomodate a large party without a problem. While the food was good, it took over 2 hours for us to receive a morsel. We tried the blueberry champagne sangria, and it tasted watered-down and funky. Maybe I caught them on a bad night? I'll have to go back to find out.",1
2501,6,5,1/10/2012,"I LOVE this place. EVERYONE IS NICE, THEY WELCOME YOU LIKE LONG LOST FRIENDS. Nai also has an excellent flamenco show. And everything on the menu is awesome. (They even did a few great vegetarian dishes just for my husband.) I will always return.",1
2502,6,5,1/9/2012,"Amazing food, great service, fun place to go. One of those places you stumble upon that will stick with you forever. The food is amazing and there is a great wine selection. They have live flamenco shows.",1
2503,6,4,1/7/2012,A delightful little place Came here for dinner with a few friends on a tuesday night. We were greeted by an extremely friendly and helpful waiter who took us through the menu in detail and made our life much simpler with the ordering. We started with a tasty mango sangria and moved to about 8-10 tapas style dishes. The food was great. Simple but great. My favorites were - pork meatballs - lobster crepes - chorizos - clams I really like this place. No BS. Just good food and good service. The bill came up to about 30-35$ per head.,1
2504,6,5,1/2/2012,"Went here on a Monday for dinner with my girlfriend. Â We decided that we need to come back asap because it was that good! The service was impeccable - so friendly and attentive. The food was amazing. We had the mussels in the paprika sauce, the chicken in the garlic sauce, the octopus with sea salt and paprika and the shrimp in garlic sauce. Â All were awesome! Nai Tapas is a go-to restaurant in Manhattan.",1
2505,6,5,12/31/2011,"We came here last year for new years and had an unbelievable time, so we decided to come back to the city and try Nai Tapas again. I asked the best waiter, Raul, for mineral water, but they didn't have it. No big deal. I just ordered water. Five minutes later he walks over with a bottle of mineral!!! They actually sent someone to the store to get me a bottle of pellegrino!!! Now THAT'S service! Everything we got(tortilla espaÃ±ola, solomillo, chorizo alla plancha, pulpo, Almejas Nai, calamares, chipirones en su tinta, patatas bravas, pollo al ajillo, sherry, chocolate lava cake, crÃ©me brÃ»lÃ©e ice cream-actually cream catalana ice cream, espresso, cava) was absolutely delicious!!!!!!!!!! Btw there were seven of us. They actually did the 12 grapes at midnight, which is always hilarious( it's a Spanish tradition)! The flamenco show was fabulous! It was a perfect New Years! Love, love, love this place!",1
2506,6,5,12/30/2011,"Fantastic tapas place! Really charming venue, really charming waiter (knows what he is talking about!), and the food was off the chain. MUST try the octopus. Really. It melts in your mouth.. soo delicious. Also, the croquetas with ham and the blood sausage are very well executed. I've been to tapas places where they charge twice as much for inferior food. This place has really got it right. The only negative thing I can say is that the sangrias were weak, but next time, I'll just order wine. Cannot wait to go back!",1
2507,6,5,12/29/2011,"Great place, good food and ambiance, affordable prices.",1
2508,6,5,12/28/2011,If I had to sum it up in 1 word it would be SPECTACULAR! I loved the entire experience from the service to the decor to the food--nothing short of spectacular. I will definitely come back.,1
2509,6,3,12/24/2011,"Vrry friendly place and food is good. Not amazing, but tasty. Sangria made with champagne is very nice option for soething different. Excelleny bread with olive oil. Best dish we had was chorizio wrapped in a thin potatoe wrap. All in all a fine place to go. Â comfortable. But not the finest tapas in theworld either. Extra credit for great welcoming service.",1
2510,6,5,12/21/2011,"I came here to celebrate my birthday and was absolutely blown away the level of service and attention provided to me and my group. The owner not only provided free sangria for the table, he also ensured that the birthday people had a flamenco lesson with the dancers! The food was quite good as well - generous sized portions that were reasonably priced. Some dishes were better than others - the choriza a la sidra was delicious, the tortilla espanola should be skipped. Overall, a wonderful birthday celebration and I would not hesitate to recommend this place to others given the level of service provided.",1
2511,6,4,12/14/2011,"This place was good, but I was very excited after seeing the 4.5* on Yelp, and not quite sure it lived up to the hype. I arrived a little before my lady friend, and was seated right away, even without my full party (pleasant surprise after reading about everyone's horrible experiences with having to wait to be seated). I was there early-ish on a Friday, but the place was pretty packed and had a nice vibe. Wait staff was friendly, and recommended a blueberry pomegranate sangria pitcher. This was pretty good, but nothing too exciting. The food menu is pretty extensive, and everything comes in a ""small"" or ""large"" portion. The ""small"" portions truely are small, but still great if you want to try a bunch of different things. Prices are right too. Food highlights were: -spanish octopus in oil with salt and paprika. This was cooked to perfection -clams in spicy creole sauce -blanched white asparagus -meatballs I also tried the patatas bravas after reading the rave reviews. can't say it was anything special (my dining companion described it as tasting like tater tots with hot sauce), but for the $4 price I cant really complain. Overall it was a fun night out, but not the best tapas I've had in the city (still a toss up between Las Ramblas and Alta)",1
2512,6,5,12/12/2011,"We read the reviews and decided to give it a try. We couldn't find any photos online from the restaurant and didn't know what to expect. It is a very nice, rustic and low key restaurant, quite small, with a bar. The food was excellent and authentic. The service was very friendly, attentive and accommodating. They really took good care of us. The champagne sangria.... Delicious! It was just what we needed. The flamenco at the end of the meal was a treat. We are looking forward to our next visit.",1
2513,6,5,12/6/2011,"Five stars for exceeding expectations! The tapas were delectable and affordable and promptly delivered (we were in a rush). The service was friendly and warm--like we were regulars, even though it was our first visit. The sangria was just the thing to loosen us up after a long day at work before going to a concert at Webster Hall. Very pleased with this find, and looking forward to going back.",1
2514,6,3,12/6/2011,"Nai's easily rises to that top echelon of east village tapas restaurants. Delicious sangria to start, a boundless medley of dishes of for all tastes, and live flamenco and music right in the center of the restaurant. Our favorites were the champagne sangria, the pork meatballs and the potatoes with chorizo. We had a few dishes with anchovies or sardines on bread that were hit or miss, so I'd err on the side of red meats next time. Our servers were also attentive and accommodating throughout (with the exception of an unfortunate spill onto one of our guests). HOWEVER, waiting over an hour with a reservation is simply too long. Our reservation was at 10, and we still hadn't received our food by midnight. It's tough to be too angry at the staff here due to their friendliness, but these are the facts, plain and simple. Our party of 14 was obscenely hungry and moderately bitter by the time our food came. Maybe they're less crowded on weeknights? I don't think I'll go back on a weekend.",1
2515,6,5,12/5/2011,"Normally I get pretty antsy when there's a long wait & I have a reservation, but Nai had such great service, food, atmosphere, and Sangria... that those anxious feelings were quelled. First off, I've learned not to get angry when you have to wait for a rezzie, b/c while you can argue that a restaurant should understand its turnover when seating & taking reservations... you have to remember in smaller joints like this you have no idea how your clientele is going to be on any given night. Â When we got there for our 8:45 pm reservation, there were lingerers. Lingerers my friends are the enemy. Â Those people that sit at a table long after the check has been paid and those painful minutes tick on by while they occupy space without bringing about any business for the restaurant as well as preventing them from seating new business. Don't fault a place for that... it's not like they can go over and be like beat it. Anyhow, that's what happened to us which is why we sat at the bar for a few drinks (complimentary of Nai) while waiting for our table to free up. Â Needless to say, everything from the bartender, to the servers were great. They were very friendly and acknowledged the wait by apologizing profusely. On to the food/drinks. YUM! We tried two different types of Sangria, the Pomegranate and the red wine. Â I preferred the red wine b/c it had more of a kick and I'm not into sweet drinks but the Pomegranate was still very fresh. Â I love tapas and especially if the menu is authentic enough that you make funny slurring noises when you try to pronounce the dishes after a few glasses of sangria that you finally resort to pointing to the menu. Here's the ranking of the dishes we tried with 1 being the highest: 1.Albondiguillas Estofada - meatballs were deliciously seasoned and tender. They were actually the last dish we had, and by that time I was so absurdly full but made room for them 2. Pulpo A La Gallega - octupus. Yummmm and tender 3.EspÃ¡rragos Navarros - great flavor and refreshing asparagus 4/5 Empanadillas De Carne & Patatas Alioli - i can't help but love empandas & potatoes! The potatoes were unlike anything I've ever had... creamy garlic 6.Pimientos De Piquillo Rellenos - I don't really know when I'm ranking this 6...I remember enjoying it but since it didn't leave an impression like the former 5... I have to put it here. But don't let that keep you away! 7. Blood sausage - my bf loved it, but just not my taste. I was expecting a spicier sausage but the sauce made it sort of sweet (which isn't necessarily bad) 8.Crepes De Txangurro - this was really the only thing I really didn't care for...the crab was more of a cream cheesy texture making this almost like a fishy dessert",1
2516,6,4,12/5/2011,"Fact of the day: Sangria means ""bloody"" in Spanish! We wanted to get a drink and a bite before an early concert in the East Village, so we let the yelpers guide our decision... and we were led to Nai. Â It was an excellent choice. We let the waiter (who might also be the owner?) choose our tapas plates. Â He urgently insisted that we get the octopus, it's his favorite. Â And we had some clams in house sauce, and fried cod crostinis. The house sauce wasn't thrilling, so I wasn't crazy about the clams plate, but the octopus was pretty awesome, and the crostinis were delicious. All of this pales next to the sangria though... They make a big vat of sliced up fruit every day and then the mix a ladle-full of the fruit with your choice of red or white wine. Â We had a pitcher of red first (because the waiter/owner said it was best) and then we had another pitcher of white. Â Hehe. Â It was yummy. Â BOTH were yummy, but if you want some authenticity, go for red... after all, red is more ""bloody.""",1
2517,6,4,11/23/2011,Best octopus I've had!!! U need to make a reservation a week or 2 in advance for more then 3 ppl on thurs and sat cause of flamenco!! But usually go with my gf and get a set at the bar!!! Service is great and so is the food,1
2518,6,4,11/23/2011,"Their sangria is delicious but not strong enough. Â I had almost a full pitcher and was barely buzzed. Â I went there for a dinner party and they were accommodating and nice. The host was nice too except when he asked if we included a tip when we were paying for our food, which I think was rude. I hate when waiters (or in this case: host) ask or demand a tip! Dude, I've been to restaurants before I know I have to tip! Don't ask me for it. We order almost all the ""tapas"" (and raciones) on the menu. Â I think some of them were a bit overpriced for their size. Â I recommend the shrimp in garlic sauce, croquetas de pollo (these were delicious), mejillones avoa (mussels), albondigas, and the fried calamari. We had cheesecake and the chocolate lava cake for dessert. They were both average. Nothing special. I am a huge flamenco lover and was looking forward to their Saturday show. Â The flamenco show was a bit disappointing. The dancers and singers were good, but they took long breaks. Â It's supposed to go from 8:30-11:00PM and I think we only heard 4 songs. Â Plus it was very difficult to see, listen, and enjoy the show. Â This was probably due to the lack of space available and the setting of the tables. Â  They are good at handling reservations and accommodating large groups. Â So i definitely recommend that. Â The ambiance is perfect. I did feel like I was in some Tapas Bar/Restaurant in Spain!",1
2519,6,5,11/20/2011,"Went with a large group (had a reservation) and the service was excellent. Â It has a quaint, cozy feel. Â The staff was very friendly. Â The food was delicious! Â Sangria very good. Â The flamenco show was a nice touch. Â Excellent place, would definitely go back.",1
2520,6,4,11/19/2011,"It would have been 5 stars if we didn't have to wait a half hour after our 10:45 pm reservation to be seated. It was a Friday, and the place was packed. Â I felt forgotten while sitting at the bar (we were lucky that a couple left a few minutes after we got there). We had to approach the host after awhile to make sure he remembered we were there. But the food. Â Ahhh...finally, Spanish tapas. Â Only thing their menu lacked was foie. Â You have a choice of tapas (small portion) and raciones (large portion). My faves: Boquerones- vinegary anchovies and minced garlic on toast. Ordered twice. Love. Aceitunas-olives stuffed with anchovy Bacalao frito-the dipping sauce was really good Mejillones Avoa-mussels in a paprika broth. After the mussels were gone, I used an empty shell to slurp up the remaining liquid. Mmmmm. Amor. Chocolate lava cake-very delicate, almost perfect. Â Needed more. Mango and red sangria-wanted the mango, and it was very good. Sweet and very fruity. Â I then ordered the red to save face after ordering a mango 'sangria'. The red was pretty damn good as well. Not my faves: Morcilla-Not a fan of blood sausage. My guy liked it though. Sardinas a la plancha-large whole sardines on toast. I'm more a fan of fish fillets. And this was another one my guy really liked so... Lomo adobado-pork loin and roasted peppers with bread. Â It was ok. Nothing exciting about it. Raul, our waiter was very attentive and helpful in giving suggestions (He's Basque btw). Can't wait to go back and try some of their other stuff.",1
2521,6,4,11/18/2011,"Great, great food. Â All the tapas I had were fantastic and I tried almost everything on the menu. Â I went on a wed/thurs and there was a band (father and son) who played really good Spanish music and two women who danced to the rhythm. Â Went with a group of friends and enjoyed the night. Â Good sangria, too!",1
2522,6,4,11/16/2011,Great ambiance!! Dancers and singers!! Wonderful wait staff and delish food!!,1
2523,6,5,11/14/2011,"Nai is one of those places I'm really surprised I haven't heard raves about just yet. It's a quaint tapas bar inconspicuously tucked into the East Village, whose open doors show a cozy cellar bar where people are happily enjoying pitchers of sangria and munching on tables full of tapas. Came on a Friday night, on a whim after walking by. We were rather impressed by the service. It was crowded in there, but they were able to seat us within 10 minutes. Our waiter suggested the mango sangria, which was served to us probably less than two minutes later, and very clearly did not disappoint. What I liked most about the sangria was that you could order it by the glass, half pitcher( $16) or full pitcher. The sangria was a slightly sweet, wonderfully boozy golden liquid speckled with fresh apples and oranges. It pretty much made my night. Moving on, the other reason that I'm dolling out one of my 5 stars is because this is one of the few tapas bars that don't make you fall into the dreaded ""tapas trap"". You know what I'm talking about- those silly tapas bars that charge $10 for a plate that require a magnifying glass to see your food and call them selves cheap eats, when you end up spending an arm and a leg to fill yourself up. Nai is not one of these places. Their dishes come in small and large portions, with the small plates running around $6 and the large running about $11-15. They also serve you a ton of super fresh bread, so our twosome was happy with sharing 4 small plates and it didn't break the bank. The food is also rather noteworthy. Their tapas are Spanish, and done well; a rarity in this city. The mejalones avos (mussels in a paprika wine sauce) were wonderfully fresh and sitting in a salty paprika broth. The patatas bravas (potatoes) were awesome and the white asparagus no joke melted in my freaking mouth. Also noteable were the pimientos ala morue, red peppers stuffed with cod and pan fried, served on small slices of crispy bread. This place is just legit. The service is great, the food is fantastic and exceptionally affordable. I'm excited to go back and munch on more of their eats, and especially excited to sample more of their sangria.",1
2524,6,4,11/9/2011,"Good food, great service in a nice space. Wine selection was inexpensive and good. give it a shot!",1
2525,6,5,11/5/2011,"WOW!! Â Phenomenal tapas & sangria!! Â Love that this place is great for groups and takes reservations. Â Came here Friday night for a birthday dinner and just fell in love with the food. Â We were party of six and practically ordered almost the entire menu list. Top favorites were the Mejillones Avoa, Croquetas De Pollo, and Bacalao Frito. Â We lost count how many pitchers of sangria we had - it was simply refreshing and delicious! Service and our waiter were friendly, attentive, & so accommodating. Â Thank you for a fabulous dining experience. Â Definitely welcomes you back and I will be back!",1
2526,6,5,10/21/2011,"I can't enough of this restaurant! The staff is always nice and welcoming, the manager always visits your table to make sure that everything is alright and the best part of it THE FOOD. You will never be disapointed. The mix of the Spanish music and the excellent food and drink (did I mention how awesome was the Mango Sangria) will make your experience unforgettable. Will go back there at least on weekly basis.",1
2527,6,4,10/20/2011,"I met a friend here recently, and overall it was a great experience. Amazing blueberry champagne sangria ($20 pitcher on a Tuesday) and friendly service. My only complaint was that there weren't many vegetarian-friendly options. In a place where you order multiple things for the table to share, its nice to have plenty of options for everyone. I do eat some seafood on occasion, so that gave me a few extra choices. We had the potatoes with spicy tomato sauce, calamari, one of the salads, some pork dish (not for me, obvi), and crabmeat crepes (too fishy). We were too full to finish everything! I've heard there are flamenco dancers some nights - I'd love to come back then for another pitcher of sangria!",1
2528,6,5,10/17/2011,"Came here twice for the flamenco show and it was amazing!!! The staff and delicious pitchers of sangria def will put you u in a great mood! The food was good, but def not as memorable as the show or the sangria! ;)",1
2529,6,4,10/13/2011,"LOve it ! Food is delicioso !!! I never ever in my life had such a tasty aceitunas (olives). Sangria is fruity and refreshing ( I had white mango sangria ) Music is authentic Spanish ( not Latin ) Service is great ( handsome spanish macho , who will help to satisfy any of your culinary desires fast and promptly ) Decor is nice and inviting . Only issue I have - that tables are to wide , so to be able to hear your companion you must seat on same side of table , not in front of each other . Prices are good also )",1
2530,6,5,10/9/2011,"Offers a phenomenal (and phenomenally delicious) selection of Spanish tapas as well as multiple flavors of sangria. They even did a live Flamenco show right next to our table! It wasn't too pricey, either. For our group of 7, the total came out to $21/person, sangria included. It was a bit loud, but I think that the atmosphere is designed to cater to larger groups. Go with 6+ people, and expect to have a great time!",1
2531,6,2,10/1/2011,"I sooo wanted to like Nai. Â The atmosphere is so lively & the host & waiter were really lovely, but I didn't enjoy my meal one bit. I started the evening with tropical sangria, which I did not enjoy. I shared four tapas - salpicon de mariscos, crabmeat crepes, mussels, & patatas bravas. Â  The salpicon dish had a few shrimp, 2 or 3 mussels, a scallop that was sliced into 3 pieces, & a few pieces of octopus over a mound of chopped tomatoes & red & green peppers. Â This annoyed me because: 1) there was not nearly enough seafood to warrant the $18 price tag 2) the dish was completely devoid of any flavor 3) the description didn't say the grilled (i.e., hot) seafood came with cold chopped veg. Â Had I known that, I would not have ordered it. Â I f-cking hate green peppers & I don't order tomatoes out because I hate getting stuck with the mealy variety that are white inside. The crabmeat crepes had a strange taste & texture - not terrible, but strange. The mussels tasted ok, but they were sooo tiny. Â  The patatas had a sauce that tasted like cooked ketchup & vinegar. My waiter asked at least twice if my friend & I enjoyed our meal. Â He seemed so nice that I didn't have the heart to tell him I didn't. Â It's because of the friendly staff that I don't have the heart to give Nai the 1 star that my meal deserved. Most of the reviews for Nai are so positive - did I order every bad plate on the menu? =(",1
2532,6,4,9/26/2011,"Having spent a while in Spain, I was pleased with this place. The dishes had quite authentic flavours (nice, but simple) and the service was excellent. We got four raciones and 2 tapas between 4 hungry men and it was just right. It gets pretty loud at weekends because they have a flamenco dance performance and music. All in good fun though.",1
2533,6,5,9/22/2011,"Amazing food, service, and entertainment. The food was great and very reasonably priced, service was attentive, and the flamenco was amazing. But, don't go here, I want to keep it all for myself.",1

1890,6,5,9/21/2011,"Nai Tapas Bar is a dream come true! I made a reservation for 8 for my birthday brunch. This little spot caught my eye as I was walking around in EV because it looked so cute + intimate! Plus there was a sign that said $12.95 brunch special for Paella & a glass of Sangria! This is an AMAZING deal IMHO because the glass of sangria is $6-7 alone. I popped in one evening with a buddy for some drinks and the owner (I'm so sorry I didn't catch his name - he was amazing!) made the sangria right in front of us from scratch. I had the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria - delish! Our paella took a while to come out (they warned us it takes around 30 mins) but our huge goblets of sangria filled that time up just fine! The brunch deal comes with a choice of either seafood paella or seafood + meat combo paella and a glass of sangria, wine, or beer. One of the girls in my group decided against the drinks so the owner brought out an extra one for me (the bday girl!) and my friend (the belated bday girl!). SUPER SWEET! He always checked up on us and was very accommodating when my friends brought out two giant cakes and sang happy birthday! A table away a few girls were eating brunch and they brought out a small cake with candles for her too! I looooove when restaurants do a little something special for their patrons when they are celebrating. The paella was so good! The chicken and chorizo were so juicy and flavorful - def go with the combo if you're in between (unless you don't eat meat) bc it's the best of Â both worlds! The portions are pretty substantial so make sure to come hungry. We didn't order any tapas but the menu looked really appetizing :) At the end of our meal, the manager divy'd up the checks for us (manually!). It was such a pleasant meal :) A shame that there weren't too many people on a Sunday during brunch hours, but I'm sure it won't stay that way for long with reviews like mine & everyone elses before me!",1
2535,6,5,9/7/2011,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE. David and Carlos are such beautiful people. I love to come here for Happy Hour and most of the time, I end up staying until they close. They have a small seating area outside that is so great for spring/summer nights. Their food is spectacular. I recommend the lightly fried cod, white asparagus, mussels and clams, and chorizo. They have various flavors of Sangria. My favorite is definitely the Pomegranate Blueberry and Mango. Champagne and Tropical are also lovely flavors. This is truly a neighborhood gem, and I make my way out there every week there due to the lovely experience that I get every time.",1
2536,6,4,9/3/2011,"I had dinner last night with my two girl friends and it was an excellent choice for a Friday night! It's not crowded which is rare for a Friday night in the city but don't be fool by the emptiness because this place serves the best TAPAS that I've ever tasted. Try the Octopus and you won't be disappointed. The Spanish Omelet was okay, nothing special. Â  Water and Sangria Red was constantly refilled, and I manage to drink a lot of water any time I go out so that was nice. Â  Service was top notch, the server was very friendly! I can't even remember when was the last time I had this kind of friendliness in a restaurant in New York City. Everyone was friendly from the busboy to the waiter and up to the bartender. Polite + Friendly! And get this, when they waiter presented the food to us, the way he explain the food is like you're watching a Food Network channel. He was so passionate! A must try and definitely planning to go there again with some of my friends!",1

Â The meat and cheeses made me feel like I was in Spain. The white Sangria was execellent. Great place for drinks/tapas.,1
2538,6,4,7/30/2011,"Two friends suggested we go here, and I'm glad they did. I've walked past the place many times and have wanted to try it out, but it always seemed very busy (and now I know why). We met at 7 p.m. on a Thursday night, which was a good time to go. It wasn't busy yet although it kept filling up as we were there. The service was top-notch and the food was delicious. The empanadas and croquettes were especially good, as was the Spanish Omelet. I'm looking forward to going again and trying more of the dishes. It's a great gem of a place with nice staff and a good ambience.",1
2539,6,4,7/18/2011,"We were a party of 10 that had a reservation on a Saturday night for my brother's birthday dinner. The restaurant was a home run for a birthday celebration. The food was very good, reasonable. The staff was attentive and friendly. The flamenico show was awesome. The dancers take themselves very seriously. They performed from 8:30- 11pm with breaks in between. Â At the end of their show, they sang happy birthday to my brother AND then they had him come onto the dance floor to dance with one of the female dancers. This was the highlight of our night.",1
2540,6,5,7/17/2011,"Sunday brunch at Nai was awesome! We arrived around mid-brunch and were promptly seated. We even got a table outside which was great since it was a lovely day and plenty of people were walking by. My boyfriend and I got the paella brunch which is both a great deal and delicious! For only $13, you get a giant paella which was well made and a sangria, wine, or beer. I don't think you'll find a deal this good elsewhere in Manhattan. Despite the deal, the paella was some of the best I've had in the City, and I am a paella fiend. I got the seafood paella and he got the mixed paella. They both feature fresh clams, mussels, shrimp, and scallops. The only difference between the two is that the mixed paella also had giant chunks of chicken and chorizo and the seafood paella had an extra langostino. The rice was perfect, cooked to a wonderful texture with just enough saffron. I thought the sangria was pretty tasty, too, with the fruit that was soaked in alcohol for a delicious amount of time. But on top of all of that, the service was excellent. The server was SO pleasant and really attended to all our needs. He even changed our waters mid-way through the meal because the ice had melted. All in all a wonderful experience. I think they just started their paella brunch menu so I really wanted to get this review up. Wanted to share this gem of a find!",1
2541,6,5,7/9/2011,"I really can't remember when I've had nicer service. Everyone, from the busboy to the host to the waiter, was so courteous and polite. When my boyfriend dropped a knife, he was given a new one in a napkin--the kind of touch that you would expect at a much more expensive restaurant. While we were there, a fight broke out among a group of about twelve guys! The (amazing) flamenco performers were right in the middle of a piece, and the dancer carried on as if nothing was happening, although she was about a foot from the flying fists. Total pro! We were late making a reservation, and the waiter was all apologies that we weren't able to sit right next to the dancers--so much more kind than he needed to be. I can't recommend this place highly enough. Oh, and get the meatballs!",1
2542,6,5,6/17/2011,"So happy my wife stumbled upon this place when she was looking for a restaurant with a flamenco show on Yelp - thank's fellow Yelpers! Â  We liked this place so much that we went back with another group of friends less than a week later and they agree'd its great. Â The food is awesome, the waiters are very attentive, and the flamenco show is amazing. Â  Our waiter Raul recommended the meatballs, spicy potatoes, crab filled crepes, cod stuffed peppers, which was all followed up with some white wine sangria. We loved everything, can't wait to go back to try the meat dishes.",1
2543,6,4,6/5/2011,"A nice spot for Sangria and tapas. I had the escargot, the crab meat crepes and a few other items. The food was good the Sangrias were the best. You have to try the Blueberry and the Mango great. The service was fast and friendly. I got to go back for the Sangria.",1
2544,6,5,6/5/2011,"I went there last night and the food was phenomenal. So full of flavor. Our waiter was so attentive and gave us great suggestions about what to order. We did the tapas size of the calimari, shrimp in green sauce and the crabmeat crepes. We also got the cheese platter because I love cheese - even though the cheese was a little on the pricey side. Great red sangria as well. It was a very enjoyable experience overall. I felt like I was back in Spain .",1

How do people hang out in the Meatpacking district and get boozed up with snobbery when such amazing, culturally sophisticated places exist, is beyond me. The food was so good! the drinks were amazing and what more can you ask for other than a live, 5 piece flamenco show with 2 female dancers, one male dancer, two guitarists and vocalists. come on a sat and/or thurs night for the live flamenco. i recommend going and not missing it, if at all possible.",1

2546,6,4,5/5/2011,"This place caught our eye last week and we stopped in for dinner last night. It was a Wednesday, so there was only one other table being used. Â The decor is nice and (obviously) we were seated right away. We asked how many dishes people usually order and were told two per person. This worked out well. We ordered pork with roasted peppers, patatas bravas, shrimp in garlic sauce, and the octopus with paprika. Â The pork was the outstanding dish, followed by the patatas. The shrimp was solid but I would have liked a little more garlic to it. Â As another commenter noted, the octopus was boiled, I like it prepared grilled, so I think we would skip it next time. It's too bad because the flavor was great, the consistency was just unpleasant. Water was constantly refilled, and I manage to drink a lot of water any time I go out so that was nice. Â Service was top notch and we definitely plan to head back. Beer and wine only.",1

We ordered 8 dishes and a pitcher of sangria. I can't remember the name of the dishes but the escargot, chicken & potato, and the salmon croquette? were excellent. The mussels, seafood salad, side of potatoes, and crab crepes were okay too. This place lets you choose the size of each dish. We ordered mostly the ""larger"" size since we were a big group. Each of us paid about $17 - totally affordable. The only thing I didn't like was the cold bread but the sauce from the food made great dipping sauces!",1

2551,6,5,3/5/2011,"Quick! -- Check this place out before the hipsters find it! I stopped in here this evening to munch on some tapas and check out the live Flamenco music. Â What a great find! Â The music was wonderful, and the atmosphere was even better. Â Good food, interesting mix of people, tasty sangria, and a fun, unpretentious vibe. Â  Also, the service is very good -- friendly and professional. Â I particularly liked the bartender tonight, who was flying around doing ten things at once to keep up with all the orders pouring in, but she dropped what she was doing the moment my food order was up and brought it to me still piping hot. Â I know it's a small thing, but I've had so many experiences at other bars where I watched with helpless longing as my food cooled off at the other end of the bar, I really appreciated that she didn't let that happen. They're doing free live Flamenco with musicians and dancers performing every Thursday and Saturday night, and I will most definitely be back for more!",1

Tapas, little portions of seafood,potatoes or chorizo, turned out to be so much fun, you are supposed to share it with your friends.There are 2 prices for a smaller and bigger portions. For 3 people the smaller portion was enough. We ordered 6 tapas and a salad. Sangrias were delicious and the bill turned out to be so much less than we expected!

2558,7,1,10/14/2012,"Rude and pompous manager/staff (except for the bus boy) - mediocre food, but didn't get sick, so if you're looking for something not too special then try it out. Â  My wife researched somewhere new to go for brunch - found this place - which opens at 10am Sundays, which was what we're looking for due to our schedule. Our party of 4 arrived at the door approx. 10:05 or so and the place was packed. Figured that was a good sign, so we waited the approx. 40 minute wait - at which time an employee, who I believe was the manager, came to us stating there was a table for 4 available but since we had Â our newborn baby he was trying to dissuade us from taking it because in his words - ""it is tight with a baby"" Well, guess what, the entire place is tight - no larger than my living room, but we were willing to give it a shot. Â The guy was hoping we would say no because a group of 4 of his friends or regulars arrived which he wanted to give that table to instead of my party. Â We were then seated and were given our water and offered coffee. We then sat there for quite sometime awaiting someone to take our order, no one came and so we continued to sit and still no one came while the waiter began taking orders from other customers who arrived after us. Â The manager walked by and saw one of our party had his menu in his hand and he snatched it out of his hand and tossed it into the menu bin as if he was put out. Â I had to finally ask the server to please take our order, which he did. For a place this size - HOW DO YOU FORGET PEOPLE SITTING 2 FEET FROM YOU?! EXCEPT if you want to forget purposely? Â  Â The food order was taken and we waited a normal amount of time for the size of an order we placed maybe slightly longer than would be expected but when the food arrived it was lukewarm and nothing to write home about. As we paid and left the manager ignored us and seemed extremely happy we were leaving. He never checked to see how our food was - nor did any of the staff. No one thanked us for coming to their establishment to eat - simply rude. I believe they didn't want to serve us because we had a baby. Â Just a side note, our newborn baby who sleeps more than he is awake was no issue and barely made a peep the entire time. Â  I would NEVER RECOMMEND eating at this establishment as I don't enjoy giving money to undeserving, disrespectful, arrogant, pompous people. Â As I said though, we did not get sick, so I guess it's edible food.",-1
2559,7,1,4/1/2012,"The owner/waiter is incredibly RUDE RUDE RUDE. Â He yelled at me and my significant other for putting our winter gloves on the table when we sat down. Â For the rest of the duration of our meal, he told us only limited items on the menu were available(smirking and giggling); he slammed down our drinks staining our cloths. Â Nook WAS a place I would go to through the years BUT NO MORE due to this guy's attitude. Â Get over yourself sir, your restaurant is NOT Le Cirque as you put it! Â As far as the food, mediocre at best.",-1
2560,7,1,10/30/2011,"After reading these reviews, the one thing I notice that everyone has in common is HOW F*ING AWFUL THE OWNER TREATS THE CUSTOMERS. We actually walked out because he was such a jerk and yelled at me in front of the whole restaurant. Nook has the worst customer service that I have ever seen in all of Manhattan. I made a reservation for 2 over the phone and when we came to the restaurant for our 9pm reservation the manager (or owner?) told us we never made a reservation. It was a complete lie and I showed him my phone with the call placed to his restaurant earlier that day - what happened to the ""customer is always right"" in the restaurant industry? Then he revised his story and said they were writing down reservations all day by accident for the wrong date and we should come back in 20-30 min for a table. We came back in 24 minutes and saw he had just seated another couple. The manager then glanced at us and refused to come to the front of the restaurant to speak to us. Finally I went to the back of the restaurant to ask him how long our table would be ready and he said it was still going to be a while. I asked him why he had sat the couple in front of us just now and he turned at me and glared, finally barking that they had a reservation before us. I questioned whether that was really true, since he had earlier told me the restaurant had ""messed up"" the reservations for tonight. Was he lying then or now? And when I say barked, he literally raised his voice so inappropriately at a customer that I took a step back and became nervous about what he would do next - the tables nearby us stopped and stared and it was very uncomfortable. My boyfriend and I immediately walked out and I will never go back there in my life. I hope no one else will subject themselves to such horrible treatment in the service industry. Plus, the food is nothing to rave about. The only reason people go there is because it is a cheap BYO - but I know plenty of others throughout Manhattan that are well worth the travel and wait rather than coming back here.",-1
2561,7,1,5/27/2008,"DO NOT GO HERE Â  The ""waitress"" was so rude, my party of three was forced to leave mid dinner. Â We walked in before the dinner rush without reservations and were told we could take a seat. Â If we weren't welcome, they could have just said so and we would have gladly gone anywhere else. Â The waitress was SO shockingly rude, I almost fealt like bursting into tears. Â Let me make it clear that my guests and I are just normal, polite, young women and did not warrant the behavior in any way whatsoever. Â When we placed our orders, one entree and two appetizers, the waitress responed with, ""That is all you are going to order?"". Â I was literally shocked. Â We left then and there. Â Not to mention, the owners are Polish and I happen to speak Polish so I was able to understand everything the horrible waitress said about us to the cook.

2562,7,2,6/15/2014,"We were so disappointed by what we ordered. We went for brunch with friends and ordered the things that no restaurant that is rated at least a 3 should mess up ever. We ordered eggs benedict, eggs florentine, the soup of the day, and french toast. The egg dishes were terrible with strong tastes of vinegar on their eggs. The potatoes that came with the eggs were very bland and definitely not memorable in any good way. The soup was not tasty and in such small portion. The french toast was probably the worst. How do you mess up french toast? It was very soggy, not fluffy at all. The raspberry jam topping was overly tart and there were only 3 pieces of french toast, as to 4. Why the strange number? THe waiters were not friendly at all: they did not invite us in while we waited outside, they hurried us with the bill before we were done figuring out splitting the bill.",-1
2563,7,2,8/10/2011,"I know only a few guys run this place but when you were promised a table in 5 min and were ignored pointedly even though u reminded the staff that you already waited 20 min... There were 2 tables but no one bothered to clean up. The staff nodded but ignored me completely and proceeded to take orders from the next table. That plainly is unacceptable. Iced coffee is most basic beverage on earth but they could not get that right, and when I asked for more syrup, they looked at me as if I were bizarre The scrambled eggs were fine but nothing you cant make at home, get some fesh salmon from Whole Foods and the right herbs, I am sure you can open a brunch place as well To be fair the eggs benedict was great, but not wow. As expected from a good brunch place. Food was alright but service was lousy, so only 2 stars.",-1
927,7,2,10/15/2010,"Tiny which makes for a good ambience. Â The food ranges from okay to good, but in my opinion is over styled and thus slightly unappetizing. Â Honestly can't even remember what I ate which is a bad sign. Fun if you're looking for a BYO but definitely better in the area. Â  Also the owner is a bit odd. Â He can be very friendly but is unorganized. I once had a reservation on a week night and he did not put a large table aside for our party of 6- instead he had us sitting separately waiting for other parties to leave. Â It was awkward and annoying. Supposedly good for brunch, but I've only been there for dinner.",-1

I wasn't much of a fan of the mushroom things everyone else seems to love--what even are those?! The food was moderately priced for what you're getting though I guess. I went with friends on a Friday evening, so I dunno if it's like this at other times (looks like more neg reviews for the brunch crowd), but it was a pretty okay scene as far as ambiance or whatever and my group took major advantage of the BYOB policy and brought a shit ton of alc. So after we started drinking I think everything actually got better. My overall feeling is ehhh but it can be good if you bring enough beer.",-1

Yes, the service can be a little haphazard due to only one person working the front of the room and maybe two the back, but this is the only way a restaurant this size and price can work and the people who go there usually recognize that fact.

2574,7,4,1/11/2013,"I started off with the Mushroom Cigars, and it comes with 2 cigars and some greens on top. It was good, though it had an interesting taste that I'm not familiar with. My appetizer was the Tuscan Chicken (chicken stuffed with spinach&ricotta with a sauce on top), which came with chive mashed potatoes and mixed greens. It was very good, and I would definitely recommend it if you're in the mood for chicken. My boyfriend got the Steak Frites, which come with Rosemary Fries and mixed greens. Steak came out as it should have been cooked. What I must absolutely recommend is the Rosemary Fries, and it is definitely something everyone should get when eating there. They're cooked to a delicious crisp, and you do get the hint of rosemary. The mixed greens are good as well because they come with this house balsamic vinaigrette that I loved (if only I knew the recipe to it!). Some warnings: This restaurant is very small, so don't go with a party of more than 6... Even 6 sounds like too much. It is cozy, but it's not a place to eat with a large group of people. Also, they only accept cash.",-1

2581,7,4,2/8/2009,"First of all, the reviews preceding mine are spot on. Â I found this place on yelp looking for a BYOB restaurant to celebrate the engagement of some friends with some champagne. Â I got a reservation for the same night. Â The owner/waiter is a weird dude for sure. Â We might have been offended but it seems to be part of the whole experience of the place. Â My friend ordered the goulash and the guy made a weird face. Â She asked if he had a better recommendation, and he waved his hands and said ""no, no, no."" Â She actually really liked the goulash. Â My steak frites was perfectly delicious though a teeny bit gristly. Â The mushroom cigar was great, but the chocolate mousse was amazing. Â  Â Definitely opt for dessert. Â The final bill was suprisingly low--byob is great! On the downside, the portions are strangely varied. Â The goulash was small, the tuna was tiny. Â The chicken was large and I had so much steak, I shared it around the table. Â The mushroom cigar is only about 4 bites. Â The mousse was plenty for 2 to share. Â Then, of course, the place is tiny and cramped and the service was definitely odd, though we had everything we needed in a timely manner. My overall advice is definitely try this place. Â Make reservations, bring cash and wine, and bring a happy, open mind, and friends or a date.

2586,7,5,10/13/2014,Love this place! I had the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon for brunch which was delicious! I've also gone to this place for dinner and had a nice experience as well. Everyone is really nice and the place has a good vibe to it. Love that its BYOB. Great place to pregame :),-1
2587,7,5,10/10/2014,"We found this little place after a few drinks in Hell's Kitchen. The place is quite small but luckily not crowded when we got there. We were three people and we shared mushroom cigars and rosemary fries for an appetizer. For our main dishes, we had Thai lamb chops, the salmon and the Tuscany chicken. All three were awesome! Too full for dessert, we chatted with out waiter. He was hilarious and we laughed the whole time. Such a pleasant meal with the doors open and unseasonably beautiful weather in the city. I can't praise this place enough. We'll definitely go back.",-1
2588,7,5,5/26/2014,"What a great experience! I've been hearing a lot about Nook but never made it before. I'll definitely be back. We came for brunch on a Saturday. It was crowded but they did a good job of managing the tables. It's amazing that one waiter can handle the whole restaurant, and the kitchen smoothly kept the food coming. Speaking of the food, there were three of us so we got to try a few things: The pierogies - we got a mix of potato/cheese and mushroom/sauerkraut. We also opted for the bacon, which made it perfect comfort food. Egg scrambles- there are a variety to choose from, so it was hard to pick. But the eggs were so good and came with a side of potatoes that were really good. Eggs benedict with salmon - really delicious I'm definitely going to make an effort to come back to try the dinner. We didn't BYOB for brunch but next time it's good to know - some tables had champagne and made their own mimosas.",-1
2589,7,5,5/1/2014,"The food here is decent, but the crowded, fire-hazardous conditions are enough to make me steer clear of Nook forever. Very fresh ingredients. Staff is quick, efficient and friendly. The mashed potatoes are amazing! The pancakes were just okay but the eggs were wonderful! The fresh squeezed orange juice comes in a small wine glass, but is apparently delicious. I would eat here again, yes yes.",-1
2590,7,5,4/1/2014,Wonderful food. Got there 1030am and had to wait for like 15 mins. The mashed potatoes are amazing! The pancakes were just okay but the eggs were wonderful!,-1
2591,7,5,3/29/2014,"The food was delicious. The service is friendly and quick. Their brunch menu has yummy potato pancakes and a salmon dish. Their other menus include mushroom cigars - greasy but great, and other nice meat/fish/veg edibles. Overall, a good experience.",-1
2592,7,5,12/14/2013,"Snapshot: 1) Fantastic food 2) Quality service 3) BYOB (with no cork fee) 4) Cash only 5) Small space (won't fit large groups) Meal Experience: When my wife and I entered, we were immediately warmly greeted by the owner, Konrad. We were seated and he brought out a large corked bottle of water and bread (complimentary when you are seated). We ordered the mushroom cigars as an appetizer, based on Konrad's recommendation. I must say, I normally am not much of a mushroom guy, but these may have converted me. They were fantastic! I could have ordered a couple of those and made that my meal. For the entree, I ordered the Tuscan chicken (which was rolled with spinach and a cheese) and my wife ordered the Portobello Mushroom Burger with balsamic sauce and goat cheese. Rosemary fries on the side. They were both really wonderful! In all, I would highly recommend this place.",-1
2593,7,5,3/18/2013,tiny place with excellent food and service,-1
2594,7,5,12/13/2012,Brunch started off with the kind of fresh baked bread that you scarf up even though you know it will fill you up. The apple pancakes were delicious as was the savory cheddar burger and rosemary fries. My only regret is I didn't have the mushroom soup! Coffee and water was kept filled to the brim by our attentive server. The place is small but the seating is comfortable and it's great people watching. Looking forward to going back.,-1
2595,7,5,12/4/2012,"Absolutely the best place ever in the city for amazing food - smallish menu but well enough choice and everything is cooked and presented perfectly (and its so reasonably priced, too). Its compact to say the least, so be prepared to sit in someone else's lap!! but this only adds to the atmosphere. The staff are friendly but I would imagine they wouldn't tolerate Prima Donna's - come here, relax and don't show off or demand immediate service. They have nothing to hide here - you even have to walk through the kitchen to the bathroom. We can't recommend this place enough !!",-1
2596,7,5,7/13/2012,"A friend suggested we try this hidden spot for brunch - bottom line, it's worth a visit. Â Place was packed for brunch, so it made sense why the waitress might not have been as fast on the service, but the owner did a great job taking care of us and more than made up for it. Â We just relaxed, enjoyed the fantastic food, and polished off our BYOB mimosas:) Â Highly recommend the egg scramble and rosemary fries and the espresso was perfectly delicious. Â Can't wait to try it out with the bf next time!",-1
2597,7,5,5/6/2012,"This place was superb Wish I had told my date to wear Merrill's to the show It is a hard walk from 44th in high heels It is less than thirty seats Our table loved: The steak, lamb chop, Tuna Tatare, cigars, chicken and salad Everything is cooked perfectly The European owners definitely have great culinary backgrounds The apple pie was unique and delish. The service is professional Â however technical, very polite and distant. Maybe due to theatre crowd and tourist traffic Ninth Ave is fun This is a great value ! Come early.",-1
2598,7,5,2/29/2012,"I have eaten here about once per month for the past few years. Â They're still BYOB, which I like. Â It;s nice to spend your money on good food and not break the bank with a good bottle of wine. I highly recommend the mushroom cigars and the seared tuna. Â I would stay away from the goulash. Â It's good, but it's made fresh daily and great goulsh needs days, not hours. Â The steaks are great too.",-1
2599,7,5,1/31/2012,"If you are looking for excellent food at a great price, this is your place. Came into the city from out of town and after reading reviews we decided to give this place a shot. If you are looking for great ambiance this won't be your place but if you like great food stop by. Ramon was a terrific waiter who remembered our names and greeted us with a smile. The mushroom cigars are unreal. I got the filet which was huge and came with 2 sides and was cooked to perfection. My gf got the lamb which was packed with flavor. Couple all of this with byob and u can't beat this place. A must go",-1
2600,7,5,4/26/2011,"Loved this place. Â 1) BYOB 2) Great food. Â We got the mushroom cigars and each of us got our own dish - steak and fries, tuscan chicken, some lamb dish, and ahi tuna. Â Absoultely delicious, especially the lam dish. Â 3) they take reservations even though the place a hole-in-the wall, 4) the waiter/hostess (place is small enough to have just one) is really friendly and very good with recommendations. Â I am definitely going back there.",-1
2601,7,5,4/15/2011,"Great place for the neighborhood, whether dinner or brunch. Really enjoyed the atmosphere there and definitely the food. BYOB!",-1
2602,7,5,2/19/2010,"Thank you yelp for helping me discover my new favorite restaurant. Â Nook is just great! Â The tuna tartar appetizer, the fillet migno were both out of this World, but the peanut butter pie was definitely the deal sealer as my boyfriend would say. Â I wonder how much it would come out to to just rent a table?",-1
2603,7,5,5/19/2009,"This place is awesome. Super tiiny but that just adds to its charm and coziness and didn't bother me at all. There was only one guy (Prob the owner) who was the host and waiter for all the tables. All the food came in a good amount of time. The mushroom cigars were amazing, we weren't sure what to expect but we were pleasantly surprised! The lamb was cooked perfectly with a ton of flavor and the chive mashed potatoes were also delicious. I also recommend the peanut butter pie - light and smooth and perfect. Also this place is BYOB with no corkage fee. My only complaint is that we were told that they needed the table back - we made a reservation at 6:30 and we left around 8:30. At a small place like that I can understand that they didn't want two people hanging around for a long time after they eat. I would definitely come back here, either for dinner or maybe for Brunch!",-1
2604,7,5,5/3/2009,"AMAZING!!! Â i almost don't want to review it b/c i don't want to let out this best kept nyc brunch secret; the BEST eggs i've ever had for brunch in nyc, and the apple pancakes are divine; and it's sooo affordable ($20/person at most) for how high quality the dishes are; the space is small/cozy, but that's all part of the charm; and the service is great; yes you'll probably have to wait, but every time I have gone (3 and counting), it has always been absolutely worth it, especially for those eggs!!!",-1
2605,7,5,12/26/2006,"Great food from a seasonal menu at affordable prices. This place is a real find in an increasingly gentrified Hell's Kitchen. It's small but friendly; come early to avoid a wait! Best of all, BYOB or hit the wine store two blocks south. Best bet: mushroom cigars. Personal fave: Goulash!",-1
2606,7,4,1/6/2015,"Taste is great, but waiting for many times that small place. Sometimes locked main gate, that's why seat is full. It's true.",1
2607,7,5,1/4/2015,"The best dining experience in hells kitchens. We come for the amazing, eclectic food, the BYOB, and the amazing host-BART!!!!! Such an amazing, cozy find in NYC. Please don't tell too many people, we don't want our Nook getting too crowded. Ps. The mushroom cigars are TO DIE FOR!",1
2608,7,4,1/4/2015,"I recently came back to Nook for brunch and was as pleased with the experience as I was the first time. Nook makes one of the best scrambled eggs I've ever had! (Sausage, onions and cheese). The eggs Benedict are also really good but I take the scrambled eggs any day, any time. The place is small and gets filled very soon, however, the service is great, very fast and efficient. I would not recommend it for big groups unless you can come very early (before 11am). It's a very popular place and I can see why. Keep in mind that it's a cash only venue.",1
2609,7,3,1/3/2015,"We had a fun, intimate dinner out with good friends at Nook. The manager was sweet and accommodating but the kitchen staff were horrified when I asked to add a beef burger to the portabello burger on the menu. All in all, not a bad option for an early dinner in HK but make sure to bring a bottle or two since it's BYOB.",1
2610,7,5,1/1/2015,"Loved it, the name of the restaurant fits well and the food was amazing everyone has to try the mushroom cigars trust me you will love them. Amazing service, was very welcoming and friendly would go there everyday if I could!",1
2611,7,5,12/31/2014,"This place is so cute! Only seats about 20 people, very small and intimate. Cash only and BYOB. The menu has great options and food was amazing. We had tuna tar tar and Tuscan chicken w/ Brussel sprouts and mash potatoes. Can't wait to go back and try more!",1
2612,7,2,12/29/2014,"Usually I love this place. My parents ask to come here every time they are in NYC. However be careful of their hours. Yelp and google list that it opens at 11am M-Sun and sadly it doesn't. We arrived Mon morning at 11:30 to a man waving us away. We are still unclear if it was going to even be open on Monday. Nook if you read this, please take the time to update your hours on the necessary web pages as to not disappoint your patrons. Cheers",1
2613,7,4,12/29/2014,"Perfect BYOB place with a steady and concise menu. Great cozy atmosphere and a very NY ambiance. The menu has an eclectic mix of different cuisines, which are all executed well. Try the mushroom cigars and the Rosemary fries!",1
2614,7,1,12/24/2014,"It was pouring rain when we got to the restaurant today at 10:50 am, we walked in the door and were immediately greeted by an angry staff with an unwelcoming voice ""we're not open til 11am. Â Okay, we stepped out and waited til 11. Â At 11 am sharp, a couple walked in and got kicked out of the restaurant by the same guy. He repeated him again with an attitude when the couple didn't move outside. I Just can't believe it how rude he was... we left and ate elsewhere it doesn't matter how good the food is... Service is equally as important. I hope he isn't the host or boss because he's simply RUDE! The service deserves no star.",1
2615,7,3,12/22/2014,I had high expectations for this place which is probably why I was underwhelmed. I had the burger and tuna salad. Â The burger was burnt and not very good but the seared tuna salad was delcious. I'm not a fan of waiting to sit/eat in cramped spaces so this place is not high on my restaurant list. But I do want to try their brunch options. They sound appetizing.,1
2616,7,3,12/18/2014,"I think it's nice that they do BYOB brunch but the food is standard compared to other brunch places. We had a longg wait in the freezing cold and the place is small so they were unable to have us stand inside. We stood outside waiting with bottles of wine. By the time we were seated, it was already an hour or so.",1
2617,7,3,12/13/2014,I live around the block so I eat once in awhile. But I don't understand why people will wait to eat at this place. It's mediocre food and the space is cramped. There are plenty of better restaurants out there in Hell's Kitchen.,1
2618,7,4,12/12/2014,"The name says it, it's a very small restaurant with bring your own wine policy (if you want to). The menu items are small but they're all good. If you go after 5pm then expect to wait for a seat, but it'll be worth the wait. The best items on the menu are the chicken and the burger.",1
2619,7,2,12/12/2014,"What's the most ideal place near Hell's Kitchen to have brunch without breaking the bank? There is a lot of hype surrounding Nook, so it seemed like the perfect place to catch up with my college roommate who will soon be relocating to New York. I figured I could ""educate"" him on some of the hidden gems of NY. Nook is also BYOB and disgustingly cheap, what's there not to like?!! Everything on the menu looked pretty appetizing, so I decide to go with one of their infamous egg scrambles: spinach, goat cheese and tomatoes. Not being the biggest fan of tomatoes. I politely requested to have them switched for broccoli. Guess it's impossible to do so because replacing it with broccoli would be the end of the world and there are no substitutions. OK, let's try for something less inexpensive like onions. NO SUBSTITUTIONS!!! Clearly,there was no winning here and had to settle for the tomatoes. Despite having dirt cheap prices in the Hell's Kitchen area for brunch and advertising a BYOB policy, the service and professionalism at Nook is down right despicable. OK I understand, you are a tiny restaurant with less than 10 tables and would like to get people in and out as soon as possible but don't rush my party of 2 and Â ask us ""Are you going to sit here all day and eat or hurry it up?"" It would certainly help to order if you waiter knew what ""Eggs Florentine "" were since he works there. Maybe that would help expedite the process in taking orders. If this place is cash only, I should be able to substitute what I want and how I want it. Or maybe it's because all of your food is cooked in bulk and comes served as pre-made overcooked mush. Whatever it may have been, Nook certainly rubbed me the wrong way. :-(",1
2620,7,1,12/9/2014,"The food may be good but the service is HORRENDOUS. I dined here with friends recently and we made a reservation. We showed up to find that making a reservation is useless. They had no table for us and asked if we would mind squeezing onto a two-top with the assurance that they would move us to a larger table as soon as one became available. We agreed, reluctantly. We ordered and before any of our food came out another table emptied. We asked if we were going to be able to move to that table and were told no because they had to save it for an incoming reservation. We reminded them that we were an incoming reservation as well but they said they needed to save that particular table because it was the only one they were able to fit 5 people at. We were once again assured we would be moved when another table became available (yet another lie). Between our apps and the main course another table did become available and when the server went to seat another party there we reminded him that we were still waiting to be moved (as he had promised us we would be). The waiter became belligerent with us. He said you are eating at a place called Nook - what did you expect? It's going to be crowded. We ask people to squeeze into smaller tables all the time. We reminded him that we only agreed to do so because he promised us that he would move us as soon as he could. He said he had no intention of moving us ever cause he needed all the tables he had for incoming reservations (again we reminded him we were one of those incoming reservations). Turns out he was saving the new table for when his buddies arrived for dinner (based on the big hello he gave them when we set them). While all this is going on he continued to take new reservations for tables he knew he could not seat and then the poor people would show up and be told that could not be accommodated. I understand that this is a small space with limited seating but why then take reservations at all. Just have it be first come/first served. Why also would you seat parties who were not all there? During our visit that was a 4-top that had only 2 people sitting at it not ordering anything for almost 45 minutes until the rest of their party arrived. I will never be back to Nook. There are too many other amazing places in this neighborhood to put up with such poor service and disrespect.",1
2621,7,5,12/4/2014,"Came here cause we yelp to see what to eat for breakfast... So glad we came... It's a hidden gem... Crab cakes, egg bendict, and one of the best scramble eggs with tomato and bacon... Everything was perfect!! Will definitely come back to visit if I'm ever in town!!",1
2622,7,4,11/23/2014,"Excellent food for brunch - simplicity displayed elegantly. Â The menu has just a few options, and they are all pretty easy, classic brunch options, but they are done very well and presented beautifully for a great price. They are cash only, and it isn't advertised or posted in a visible location, so be prepared for that. Â It's my only barrier to returning often.",1
2623,7,4,11/20/2014,"Great pre or post theater spot. Â As mentioned - BYOB (do yourself a favor and stop by 9th Ave Vintners and not the overpriced liquor store a block south of Nook), tiny, and cash only. Â One of the tastiest and least expensive filet mignons in midtown - seriously, I dream about that filet and the red wine reduction that accompanies it. Â Mushroom cigars and pepper crusted tuna are also standouts. Â Fun, different ""hidden gem"" type spot that's perfect for impressing family (or your significant other's family) who've bought tickets to a Broadway show and you want to treat to a nice dinner without breaking the bank.",1
2624,7,4,11/16/2014,"VERY appropriately named. It's tiny, but they make great use of the space. As soon as we arrived for brunch on Saturday we immediately regretted not reading the Yelp reviews & tips to see that this place is BYOB. The table next to us left to buy some champagne two blocks down, but it was so cold and rainy that we simply refrained. The food was fantastic, the service was gracious, and our food came out very quickly. Be warned: this place only accepts CASH.",1
2625,7,2,11/12/2014,Overall fair. Bread was blah. Mushroom cigars were the best dish of the night. Portabella burger was mediocre. Apple 'pie' more closely resembled an Apple Betty and the apple slices on top were flavorless. Wait time for the food was ridiculous. Over priced for what was served. There is better elsewhere. Expected far better based on the reviews.,1
2626,7,5,11/9/2014,"Pros: BYOB - No corking fee Food was great (had the country salad, tuscan chicken, kabobs and mushroom cigars) Excellent service - Ramon was friendly, helpful and hilarious Cons: Tiny space, make reservations in advance for dinner If you sit by the door, it can get pretty cold as people come in",1
2627,7,3,11/4/2014,"This place is definitely in the name -- Nook. There is one long bench on one side, and they have to pull the opposite chairs out all the way in order for the person to get to the bench. Awkward and small but definitely very intimate. Unfortunately it was also very busy so there was quite a wait for a Saturday brunch, about an hour. There wasn't a list or anything, the host sort of forgot us so... That was pleasant. They don't have any alcohol, but you can bring your own without a corkage fee. Overall the menu is pretty small, but whatever you could possibly want for breakfast, you can probably find it on there. They also had the dumpling looking breakfast options I had never heard of before. I did not have the chance to try anything except the salad, which landed around $8.00USD and was quite small and not very filling, however, because of the time, it worked out nicely for my early dinner plans. Overall, despite the ambiance and (forgetting us) wait, I found the place to be rather cozy. I really don't recommend going with more than 2 people though, it's really really cramped. BYOB!",1
2628,7,3,11/4/2014,A bit overpriced for a casual dinner. Apple pie was amazing.,1
2629,7,3,11/2/2014,"We went for the brunch. Good food globally but not overwhelming. Quiche is good, eggs Benedict ok but not very tasty - very good potatoes pancakes with salmon. The experience is unfortunately lowered by the tiny/crowded space + the too loud music. We were also a little bored that the ""cash only"" fact was not announced/written somewhere. Still it is a nice place for a casual brunch.",1
2630,7,5,11/1/2014,"fantastic food, and the service is great. very reasonable prices too, and BYOB so you don't get ripped off on the drinks.",1
2631,7,5,10/22/2014,"Shhhhhhhhhhh, do not tell anyone how good this place is, there is no room to fit a single other person on a Saturday or Sunday morning.",1
2146,7,5,10/19/2014,"We went for a Sunday brunch. There was a 20-30 min wait which wasn't too bad. The interior of the restaurant is pretty small (I guess, hence the name Nook). While we were in the line, the waiter did suggest picking out what you want so you can order it immediately once you are seated. Both of us ordered scrambled eggs (one with smoked salmon and the other with zucchini, squash and peppers). And I have to say, they were probably the best scrambled eggs I have had in a long long time. The red onions mashed potatoes were awesome and the greens on the side made it a perfect meal, hence the 5 stars. The servers were very attentive and quick. The freshly squeezed orange juice was very refreshing. We are definitely coming back here to try other stuff. Don't forget, this is a cash only place!",1
2632,7,5,10/16/2014,"This place is excellent!! The food is delicious and a very cozy atmosphere. Always good music. The Steak Frites, Sashimi Peppered Tuna Salad, and Konrads' Goulash are my favorite. Also try the mushroom cigars and crabcake w/ wasabi! BYOB ( w/ no corkage!) and Cash Only!",1
1914,7,3,10/12/2014,"Nook is dependable, which is why it's been one of my go-to dinner places for the past 3-4 years. The majority of the menu is honestly just okay, but the filet mignon is worthwhile and the prices overall are reasonable. Plus it's BYOB, so how can you not come back to this place? 3.5 stars would be my most appropriate rating. Just know that anyone with a little more meat on their bones WILL feel cramped, and making a reservation is definitely recommended (though 2 people could easily get in at normal dinner hours during the week). Menu highlights: mushroom cigars, tuna tartar, filet mignon, rosemary fries. CASH ONLY.",1
2633,7,3,10/10/2014,"We were looking for a cute brunch place in Hell's Kitchen and thought this might be able to hit the spot, but it was disappointing, and mediocre at best. Â Understand that the place is small, but our server (who also seemed to be the host and owner?) was rude and rushed us through the whole meal. Â As an appetizer we shared the crab cakes which were made well and flavorful. Â The entrees (eggs florentine and eggs benedit) were just alright, and the poached eggs overcooked. Â Also, $3 for a can of soda is a bit too much for a shabby looking place.",1
2634,7,1,10/6/2014,"Food is ok. Love the tomato soup, BUT! Worst service ever! Rude! arrogant! Unprofessional! And extremely claustrophobic! Oh and get your cash if you go there. 2014 and they don't accept credit.",1
2635,7,1,10/4/2014,This evening we called around 1030pm and asked the time they closed and they said 11pm so we said we would be right there. We arrived at 1045pm and the server said they were closed. The chef in the kitchen also said they were closed and they shut everything off and even took out the trash. Your posted closure time is 11pm you should be open for service until that time. Closing earlier than your posted time is far from proper business etiquette and very wrong. Very disappointed in this attempt for dinner. Find another service oriented place.,1
2636,7,5,9/21/2014,"We went for brunch on Saturday morning and couldn't of had a better time. Yes, the place is smaller than my living room, and yes, it only seats 20-24 people. I'm not sure what the other people on here expect for good service, but I thought it was great! Both guys that served us were very kind and attentive. Our food was great! My wife and I both had scrambles...with fresh squeezed orange juice. All of it was delicious! They don't take reservations we found out...and are indeed cash only.",1
2637,7,4,9/20/2014,"Stopped in here for our last meal in the City based on the Yelp reviews. Great food served with fresh baked bread served by the owner/chef who worked the kitchen with his sous to serve the cozy restaurant. All tables were full, including a table of 8 next to us that we're clearly enjoying the BYOB option! I had the quiche, and the others I was with enjoyed 2 of the scramble options. No frills, but you felt like you were in the owner's home kitchen. I especially appreciated the fact that he allowed us to chat a while, and didn't rush us out if his restaurant.",1
2638,7,4,9/14/2014,This restaurant is a tiny little gem. The Tuscan Chicken was outstanding and both of my daughters said the burger was the best they have ever eaten. The decor is very casual but comfortable. Call ahead because space is limited. Also be aware that it is cash only and no pouring license. Minor inconveniences for an excellent dining experience.,1
2639,7,3,9/13/2014,"The cigarette mushroom is indeed a good Â  BYOB is great. Great service. Very small place. I am glad i tried, but i would not go back.",1
2640,7,2,9/10/2014,This really is a very small restaurant where you are sitting on top of your neighbors. We were a party of two and were quickly seated for late breakfast / brunch. That said the service was surprisingly slow and inattentive. I had a scramble and was greatly disappointed. The eggs were wet and fairly under spiced. The Sweet potato side same issue. Salad was fine but dressing was not flavorful. My companion had the eggs Florentine. He thought the eggs were over cooked and the dish under spiced as well.,1
2641,7,5,9/6/2014,"My husband and I love to come here for dinner on weekends. While this place is truly a ""nook"", the food is absolutely delicious... and it's BYOB! We always have such a great time! Ramon is an excellent waiter and always greets us like were friends. Love this place!",1

2643,7,4,9/3/2014,"Nook is such a great little ""nook"" in Hell's Kitchen. The entire restaurant has about 8 tables. I took my sister to Nook for her birthday and everything was delicious!

1611,7,3,8/26/2014,"I have to agree with my friend's review here. My meal was okay, but nothing great. I found our tuna tartare appetizer to be too mushy. I like when the tuna pieces are firmer, these were all chopped up and leaning towards more of a puree consistency. For my entree, I had the shrimp salad. It was decent, but the shrimps were slightly overcooked and I wasn't too fond of the dressing. I did try my friend's steak frites and thought it was very good. I also enjoyed the rosemary fries. The waiter overcharged me for my salad (gotta always check the bill), but he quickly adjusted the price once I pointed it out. It is better when the bills are automated.",1
2646,7,4,8/25/2014,I went here with my girlfriend for brunch 2 weeks ago and found this 8 table restaurant to be amazing! Not only is it delicious but incredibly cheap and the service was fast! The eggs Benedict florentine over smoked salmon is delicious and it comes with these toasted pepper mashed potatoes & side salad...yummy!! Â My girlfriend got the traditional eggs Benny which she also loved and I think between the two of us it was under 25 bucks!!! Did I mention they give you a basket of mini muffins on the house to start. Oh and pretty sure it's BYOB;). Please be sure to bring cash as it is cash only;),1
2647,7,2,8/24/2014,Reassessment of the Nook! Â Great scramble with good price. However... Â I ventured out to the $12.50 Egg Benedict with smoked salmon has a questionable dijon (?) sauce and 4 of the SMALLEST 4 SLICES of LOX you could put on. Â  And CASH ONLY in the smallest cursive font on the bottom of the menu. Â Guys really? Â Put up a sign and go to Costco and buy the $20 salmon pack and show the love on the benedict?,1
1610,7,3,8/21/2014,"Came here with a friend this week and we left feeling sort of in the middle about the food. The tuna tartare had a nice sweet sauce but the tuna itself was a bit too mushy and the avocado was also too mushy like prepackaged guac consistency. I'm not sure if the avocado was fresh or not. I had the steak frites which had an amazing sauce again but was a bit fatty. The waiter (a younger guy) added a few more bucks to my friends salad when the bill came. We told him and he apologized but really? That's so sneaky. While the meal was ok, I don't think I'll be back.",1
2648,7,1,8/17/2014,"I have been to this joint several times and the food has been good and service mediocre but bearable. It is a small place and when the clean-shaved guy is the running the show, the crowd outside is well managed. But today after going to the place for over two years, the bearded dude tried to squeeze three people on the tiny two person table and when we pushed back, he yelled at us, telling is that we need to decide if we want to eat here since he has ppl waiting I the line! We left ofcourse for another brunch place where we didn't have to deal with an overwhelmed moron.... Seriously this dude has no business running point at a tiny restaurant and frankly the food isn't that great for this idiot to speak to patrons in such a way........it was good till it lasted. Strongly recommend against this place specially when there are so many more cool brunch spots in Hells Kitchen........",1
2649,7,5,8/17/2014,This place is a hidden treasure in the hustle and bustle of NYC. I was surprised when I reached this place because it really is a nook. The dining area is only slightly bigger than my dining room but don't let the size fool you. It is absolutely worth the wait! It's a 5 man show. 2 in the front 3 in the kitchen yet they delivered our food in no time. I would recommend this place for brunch since that's what I had. Egg Benedict's with smoke salmon and potato pancakes were out of this world.,1
2650,7,5,8/16/2014,Geat find! Tiny place but excellent food and friendly service. We had the steak frites and the pork chop. Both were excellent but the perogi starter and the apple desert were outstanding. Â It's tiny so make a reservation.,1
2651,7,5,8/14/2014,"IF YOU LIKE GREAT FOOD, AWESOME SERVICE, AUTHENTIC NYC HOLE-IN-THE-WALL CUISINE...COME HERE. and if you dont like any of the above...you're the worst. I came here for my boyfriends birthday this past Saturday, with a relatively large group of friends, considering the place is about 20 ppl max, but do not let that draw you away. theres typically an affixed $46/person menu when its a group of 10 or more people because the business owner needs to make sure hes getting business...i cannot blame him for that and neither should you. our group of 12 can vouch for the deliciousness of almost every single item on the menu - from appetizers to dessert: the tuna tartar and the mushroom cigars - both amazing the filet mignon - fantastic steak frites - my boyfriend cleaned his plate, which included the rosemary fries WHICH YOU NEED TO GET BECAUSE THEY ARE SO AMAZING. I DONT EVEN LIKE ROSEMARY AND I WANTED TO EAT THEM ALL. rack of lamb - my girl friend cleaned her plate as well tuscan chicken - super yummy i order the garden pasta...which i made every single person at the table try...and all of us were just in awe by how tasty a simple penne pasta could be. i requested a birthday type dessert for my bf - peanut butter chocolate cheesecake that all of us shared and loved! this place is BYOB which is just the cherry on the pie. But lastly, YET IMPORTANTLY, Ramon, our server, was impeccable. He brought glasses of ice, glasses for wine, water to stay hydrated. Ramon was absolutely fantastic, hilarious, and accommodating. We left nook happier (and a bit tipsy-er) than when we entered, and cannot wait to go again, not just for the food, but also to say hello to Ramon :)",1
2652,7,4,8/11/2014,"This place is a tiny gem! Thanks to all the yelp reviews I found this place as an alternative to the spot I was taken to as a surprise. Now this spot offers nothing in terms of ambiance but sometimes all you need from a restaurant is a good meal, and boy does Â Nook deliver. I ordered the Tuscan chicken while my friend ordered a spicy version of the penne pasta. This chicken dish was SO well seasoned! Every bite was a party in my mouth! I would definitely go back here but probably in the fall and winter. It was blazing hip hop and R&B on this balmy summer Sunday evening when I went, and although the AC was on, it actually felt like a waste of electricity because I was sweating so profusely. All in all, I had a great experience.",1
2653,7,5,8/10/2014,"Found this place on yelp. Â It's a tiny place with big flavors. Â I had the scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese and smoked sausage, it was delicious.

Â The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. Â This place is a little gem.",1
2654,7,4,8/7/2014,Nook is a pretty accurate description of the resturant. Â Cool little place and real nice breakfast. Â Food was good and just the right proportions. Close to all the Times Square hotels without being some chain or covered in neon.,1
2655,7,4,8/4/2014,"Went to Brunch there on Saturday after reading Yelp reviews. Â tiny place, waiting line but we only waited 15 minutes for a table. Â Service fast.

2656,7,1,8/3/2014,"This restaurant used to be one of my favorite places to visit in the neighborhood; great food, nice ambience, Â and decent prices. However after the experience I had yesterday, Â I will not be coming back here and urge you to take your business elsewhere as well. My friend is allergic to red peppers and asked the waiter if it would be possible to substitute that ingredient for something else in the egg scramble. She was rudely told that if she read the menu, she would see no substitutions are allowed; Â really, Â even when a person is allergic? Additionally the gentleman didn't mention that the side of potatoes had red peppers. When my friend asked for little oil to be used they brought out eggs literally swimming in oil. Another customer was almost reprimanded for ordering too much food when ordering a burger with bacon and some crabcakes. Is this how we deserve to be treated when we choose to have a meal in a restaurant? Â To be told that we are fat or should suffer because of an allergy? Finally, Â when I found out that the waiter was the manager of the restaurant (with much shock) Â and told him how his behavior was offending the customers and not great for business (especially when there are so many restaurants around the corner) he simply laughed it off and insisted that he did nothing wrong.. very classy Mr. Owner/Manager whoever you are. Do yourself a favor and go eat at one of the places where you feel the restaurant staff actually WANTS you to have a great experience and is appreciative of your business.",1
2657,7,3,8/1/2014,"Service was friendly. Did not find the $19 Ahi tuna avocado salad worthwhile. $12 eggs benedict was yummy. Â Super tiny restaurant with tables squished to ether that requires moving tables every time you get up. It is cash only, and there is a tiny bathroom in the back of restaurant in which you have to walk through the narrow cramped kitchen. This place is truly nook!",1
2658,7,4,7/31/2014,"Very descent prices and excellent service, bread basket arrived at the table as son as we sat, get there early!!! space is very small, I had the eggs benedict and they were fantastic. boyfriend had the steak and eggs and he also loved it :)",1
2659,7,4,7/27/2014,Decent prices and wonderful menu. Our server was a sweetheart. Great little setting. I actually love the fact that it's tiny and intimate. FYI steak frites and Thai rack of lamb were amazing.,1
2660,7,4,7/25/2014,Great place for brunch food but the wait is pretty killer (in a bad way).,1
2661,7,4,7/18/2014,"Nook is a tiny place. Yes, there is a solitary man taking care of all customers. But the food was beyond good. Â I loved the baguette with cheese and jam appetizer; it sounded like a curious combination but it arrived beautifully plated and was easily devoured by all.

2662,7,5,7/17/2014,"Very close to where I live. I came here a few times and one time I met this guy work in the restaurant, he is so funny and was helping me with directions in the city since I just moved here not long ago. And I def would come and try for dinner in here.",1
2071,7,4,7/16/2014,"Nook really does live by its name. Â It's a teeny tiny whole in the wall restaurant that you could easily miss if you weren't looking. Â  There are only about 10 tables, so get here before it gets crowded. Â The menu has a good variety of different options. Â  Our waiter suggested the mushroom cigars, tuna tartar and pork chop or steak. Â My girlfriend and I were not in the mood for appetizers (especially after stuffing ourselves with bread and wine) so we decided to go right for meat as per usual. We ordered the steaks and she got brussel sprouts and I got the fries and we decided to go half and half so we could try both. Â I must say the rosemary fries were very good but the dill flavoring of the brussel sprouts was quite unique as well. Â I will definitely be back because the pastas from the table next to us smelled absolutely amazing and I'm dying to try the mushroom cigars. Â BYOB = awesome.",1
2663,7,5,7/16/2014,"Very good Sunday brunch! Came with three friends and we arrived at 10:03am, just after it had opened, and got the last table for four. Keep in mind this place is quite small! Bread was brought to the table for starters--the really fresh, good stuff. Then my husband ordered the fruit cup. It was divine. I find fruit cups bland, normally, but this one had a unique blend and variety that included passionfruit, which gave the cup a bit of saucy texture. Very nice. We also ordered a cappuccino and espresso which were good. Our entrees included the eggs Benedict, eggs Florentine (same as the Benedict but with spinach), potato pancakes with salmon, and one of the egg scrambles. We all really enjoyed our choices and finished our plates! I would definitely return if I was in the area but would not wait 30+ minutes like some people did while we ate. But maybe that's just me--when I'm hungry, I'm hungry.",1
2664,7,2,7/14/2014,"This was one of the first restaurants I ate at in NYC, and so I think I was a bit jaded in thinking it was some of the better food I had. Â  While the BYOB is nice, the food just isn't there for me. Â Going back to revisit, I was a bit disappointed to find that in the end, it's just another restaurant. Â Nothing here really knocks it out of the park or screams originality. Â  While nothing was wrong with the food, per se, I just won't be coming back.",1
2665,7,5,7/12/2014,"I've been here about three times and I love it more and more everytime! They are BYO so you can bring any kind of alcohol you want and enjoy your meal with your favorite wine or beer. It's a small place, but its cozy and quaint. The waiter is hysterical. I love talking to him. He has the best stories and he's so friendly. He loves what he does. He takes care of all the tables in the restaurant (it's that small). The food is amazing though! They have salads, entrees, and amazing desserts. They have really good porogies too. You have to try this place!",1
2666,7,4,7/10/2014,"Great bang for your buck. Food: I appreciate the simplicity of the menu first off. They really understand their audience. I went safe and got an egg scramble with mashed potatoes and side salad for brunch. The potatoes were flavorful-- a perfect combination of soft and salty. The egg scramble was great. And the salad had a really lovely light dressing on it. Definitely a dish that's hard to actually mess up, but still very good. Service: The servers are very nice and attentive. They understand it's a small place. Probably seats 18 at most. Just fyi, this place is for sets of 2- you'll wait longer for a bigger party. It's definitely the sort of place that has regulars, which is always a good sign!",1
2667,7,5,7/4/2014,What a great find! Â BYOB in NYC??? Absolutely fabulous! Ramon made our night!! Â Food was great! Â Took Ramon's advice on everything and loved all! Love ya our new BFF!,1
2277,7,3,6/29/2014,"Came here for a late lunch w a gf the other weekend. Â I picked the place just based on the location, relatively high reviews from other helpers, and enticing pics of dishes. I was warned that the place didn't have liquor license or take cc's, but I didn't realize how tiny the place is! Â Be warned that there will be a wait since the restaurant can't seat more than twenty patrons at a time, and you will be sitting in very tight quarters w other patrons dining in tables next to yours. The food was fine. I had the seared tuna w avocados. Â It was fine, nothing earth shattering but not bad either. Â My gf had the scrambled eggs w the mashed potatoes and she enjoyed the dish. The service was OK. Â There was only one guy who was servicing the whole place. He seemed like the manager or maybe the owner. Â His manner was a bit abrupt but it could be bc he was a foreigner. Â Eastern Europeans (i think that was what he was) come across bit gruff in their demeanor which I can see would rub ppl the wrong way (hence some of the negative reviews). Â He brought out our bill before we asked for it, which as we all know is a big no-no. Esp since we were looking to end our meal w coffee and dessert, which he then had to add to the bill. Again, this place was a far cry from Daniel or Les Bernardin, so I wasn't expecting a 5 star service. Â But I think this place could go far if service was improved a tad.",1
2668,7,4,6/28/2014,"Went there for Brunch on a Saturday 11am, and was seated for 3 people in 5 minutes. I would definitely make reservations if you have a party of 5 or more because it is a small place. The service was excellent and the omelette's and French toast were fresh and delicious. They had a special purÃ©e jam to put on the French toast. The Omelette's come with red onion mashed potato that are delicious. The coffee was bold and terrific,and they had NY tap water in bottles on each table! See my pictures! It may be small but they serve quality food at a reasonable price!",1
2669,7,2,6/23/2014,"Came here on a Saturday for lunch with 3 of my friends. There was a wait when we got here. They told us the wait would be 15 minutes but it ended up being over an hour. Yes I understand your restaurant is small and I get that we would most likely have to wait longer than 15 minutes... but to seat other people that were behind us on the waiting list? (Especially when I see there is a table that can fit my party) Not cool. Pretty sure this could of happened because my friend was running late since she was trying to find parking and it was just the 3 of us on line. But either way, I felt the that staff was very disorganized and rude.. There are empty tables and you are just going to let us stand outside? (Also by this time, no one was waiting on line). Even if our party had 3 people, the table that we would have gotten would have been the same as a table for 4! Moving on.. I was hoping the food would make up for what had just happened but it didn't. Only one of my friends has been here and recommended this place from when she used to come here back in the day. Â She hasn't been here for over a year and said this place has definitely went downhill from what she remembered. I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon and I was not impressed. Â I've had much better.. even in Jersey.. for much cheaper! My friend also wanted to add cheese in her scrambled eggs but the waiter said no. Â At first we thought he was joking but then we realized he was being really serious and said they don't do any substitutions/can't add anything additional to the entree. My friend would have happily paid for extra cheese. Â He then suggested that she order something else on the menu. Â Um, how hard is it to put cheese in eggs?! Â For the price we've paid, I expected much better. Also, the waiter rolled his eyes when my friend asked for milk with her tea. Seriously? Why are you so upset about making another trip? It's your job! If you do decide to come here.. just know that they don't accept credit card so make sure you bring cash. The only positive thing I have to say about this place is that it is BYOB even though I did not take advantage of that. Also, if you like to be super close next to a stranger while eating your food and literally putting your ass on their table (and I don't even have a big one) while trying to get out of your seat to go use to the bathroom.. this is the place for you!",1
2670,7,5,6/21/2014,"Nook is absolutely amazing! Whenever I visit NYC, Nook is always first on my list for Brunch! The eggs Benedict is cooked perfectly EVERYTIME, the orange Juice is super delicious (I drink it slowly to savor every sip and the red onion mashed Potatoes are like the crack of mashed potates!! Once you have it, you'll be addicted!! I'd recommend Nook to anyone and everyone!",1
2671,7,4,6/21/2014,"Very cute BYOB place! The menu is eclectic and the food delicious. Â I particularly loved the Mushroom Cigars, Goulash (almost as good as my grandmom's!) and sweet potato fries. Â  The restaurant is very tiny (seats maybe 20 people at max) - so I don't reco for a group. Â (We were a group of 4 and were very smushed around a small table.) Â But the place was packed, which speaks to what a great place this is! Love that it's BYOB - there are not enough of those around! Â Reasonably priced - we couldn't believe how low our bill was for a delicious dinner (the BYOB helps!). Heads-up - it's cash only.",1
2672,7,3,6/19/2014,"Star rating is for the food only. Customer service rating would tank my review. (more on that in a few) Met up with a friend for a sunday brunch, we were seated fairly quickly (which was nice). Â Both ended up getting the smoked sausage scramble. Â While not mind blowing, it was not horrible either. Just meh. ok. mediocre. Â The mashed potatoes were interesting. Pretty tasty actually. Â There were other things on the menu that actually sounded promising. (Like the pancakes, the table next to us ordered them, and they look pretty damn good.) Anyways, on to the real reason for my review: the horrible customer service. Like other reviews have stated, this place is tiny, and packed. So that being said, we knew that the one waiter working the place was super busy. Â So we figured we'd order our food AND drinks at the same time. Â And we did. But when my friend asked to get a coffee AFTER giving our food order, the dude rolled his eyes and said in an exasperated zone ""That's what I just asked you."". Â Sorry, but no. You don't ever roll your eyes IN FRONT of a customer, nor do you turn give attitude to people who were nothing but pleasant just because we skipped over the ""what you would like to drink"" part of your speech, especially considering we said we were ready to order. We really should've just walked out right there. But we didn't cuz we were hungry and we were already seated and ordered. So we got our food...nom nom nom. No coffee ever came out. And then we asked for our bill - surprise surprise, coffee listed on the check.",1
2673,7,4,6/16/2014,"Okay, so I'm not really sure what brunch is. I think it's just an excuse to eat breakfast food in the afternoon and drink sparkly orange juice. Correct me if I'm wrong, but whatever it is, I haven't had it in years. I know, sad right? I just can't wake up that early. (usual waking time: 2PM) But I think I'm going to have to start. Just need to invest in a few more alarms. Anyways~ Nook was a nice reintroduction to brunch. Although I don't have much to compare it to, I felt that this place was quite good and probably above average. I stumbled upon this place on a Sunday afternoon so I wasn't prepared with drinks. But yes, this place is BYOB so bring your sparkling wines and make mimosas because they don't have a drink list. Except for the boring stuff like coffee, tea, and soda. I saw on the menu that you do have to order at least $15 per person if you want to avoid cork fees and such. Not a big deal. But it is cash only here. As for the food, I had an Eggs Florentine. I've been so out of the brunch loop that I actually had to google what that is. So embarrassing but I can't be the only one so for anyone else that does not know, it's basically an Eggs Benedict (poached egg, english muffin, black forest ham) with some spinach. Sounds simple enough yet very satisfying and very beautiful too. I love the colors the dish has with its bright yellow, green, pink, and orange. It's a very appetizing dish. And the egg, I love eggs and this egg was perfectly poached. When you take the first slice with your knife, the egg yolk oozes out sweet creaminess onto the rest of your food. It's delightful. But I have to say, I did feel like the dish was a little lacking in flavor and I didn't really like the hollandaise sauce. It had a sour aftertaste which I wasn't too fond of. And the egg white was a little...stretchy (you can see the weirdness in the picture). Maybe overcooked? I don't know. The mashed potatoes were good though with the tomato undertone as well as the fresh salad. Water tasted a little funny and warm since they don't put ice. They just have it on all the tables in a bottle. But it's okay because I'll definitely bring my own drink next time I come. I was craving a mimosa so bad! I almost asked another table if I could have some of theirs. It would have been perfect with my meal. Overall, it was a good experience. Atmosphere is good especially when the weather is nice with the open doors and windows. The place is really small though with about 10 seats or so, however it doesn't feel very tight and crowded. But it's probably best not to come with a big party. Great for brunch dates!",1
2674,7,1,6/15/2014,"So upsetting when a great place goes down hill. I raved about their brunch & decided to finally come back after 2 years. What a huge let down. My eggs florentine was not good. The eggs came out cold & spinach minimal atop a soggy English muffin. We ordered potato pancakes to try, total bust! We didn't even eat 1 & waiter couldn't care less, didn't even ask if anything was wrong. The French toast was good but not great. Skip this hole in the wall & make a reservation to Norma's.",1
2675,7,5,6/12/2014,"Ok, when they call it nook, they literally mean the restaurant space is no bigger than a nook. We were six people and they put two tables together in front of the kitchen entrance to fit our party. They played loud techno music, too loud for continued conversation. But even with the odd space and the ambience. The food is incredible!! I would go back and back. Especially for the price. Started with flavor packed piroshkies (mushroom and cheese potato) so good! Then ordered the soup of the day (cauliflower) delectable!!! And the cavality salad... Out of this world! Raw chopped Brussels sprouts with red beets, goat cheese and candied chopped walnuts with a drizzle of truffle oil and honey. All of these flavors come together and at the same time are distinct in your mouth. I wish I had an extra serving of this salad! My husband had the Tuscan chicken: he says whoo! When I asked how it was. I tried a bite and it was delicious! Flattened chicken breast rolled and stuffed with greens. Covered with a tomato cream sauce. My brothers had the lamb and the goulash. Both said their meals were very good. Cash only! And BYOB!! When we first walked in and realized no alcohol my husband said he would be back and came back with two 6-packs. Overall, amazing food for a great price!",1
2676,7,5,6/11/2014,"Awesome awesome awesome. I live in the area but have not been to this restaurant before. I was looking for a Saturday brunch spot and stumbled upon the Yelp reviews for this place. I walked over and was pretty surprised at how small the restaurant is and how long the line of people waiting outside was. However, the owner (or manager ..or?) Was super efficient, only seated parties when everyone was there, took orders very quickly, and they serve people very efficiently. Before I forget, this is a cash place - heads up Back to the review. I had eggs Benedict that was absolutely amazing. You know how some restaurants screw up Benedict and they overcook the muffin and you end up stabbing at it with your knife until your egg and your muffins slide off of the plate? That won't happen here. Absolute perfection. I gobbled down every piece. My friend had another egg dish (the name escapes me at the moment) and absolutely devoured it as well. Service was impeccable, super friendly people, great location, efficient, fantastic brunch spot. I will be back at other times of the day and will continue to frequent this place now! Great job and great... Well, everything.",1
2677,7,4,6/11/2014,"Outstanding! Went here with family before the Symphony tonight and it was great. We had grilled chicken, braised cabbage, wonderful cauliflower soup & a salad. Excellent food; fast service that was friendly & reasonable prices. A gem in the neighborhood!",1
2678,7,5,6/8/2014,"Freakin amazing! Eggs florentine blew my mind. When he said it came with mash potatoes I was like no thanks I don't like mash potatoes. But he wouldn't substitute for anything which initially I thought was rude, but I'm glad he made me keep them cause they were phenomenal! I'll eat here again for sure!",1
2679,7,4,6/6/2014,Huge fan of Nook. Went with two of my friends on a Saturday and it was delightful. I got the eggs benedict with fresh OJ which was great. My other friends got the scrambled eggs which they enjoyed as well. The place is VERY small and we got lucky when a party of 4 was leaving and we got to sit down almost instantly. I will be making a trip back very soon.,1
2680,7,5,6/1/2014,"my boyfriend and I came here after making a dinner reservation before a show. it's a very small cozy restaurant, seating about 20 people at most. for appetizer we ordered the mushroom cigars, which was really tasty. the phylo layers were nice and crispy and the mushroom had a very meaty flavor to it. we tried the Tuscan chicken and steak frites, both of which did not disappoint. the cream sauce in the chicken was soo good and the brussel sprouts was actually a nice complement to all the cream. the steak frites were very good also, cooked exactly as ordered, and the fries that came with it had a hint of rosemary. for dessert we got the peanut butter pie.. and it was so.. good. it tasted like a fancy and less dense snickers bar. a must try for sure! but i would ask them to skip on the raspberry syrup. overall I had a great experience, and to make it even better it's byob!",1
2681,7,1,5/19/2014,"I went here for brunch and was not impressed. Since I had dietary restrictions (not for allergies), I got the lox scramble without the cream cheese. The menu said it came with a side salad and mashed potatoes. My plate came with no mashed potatoes. I was told they omitted them for me without asking because they made it with dairy. I can have some dairy, however, it was the fact I was not asked if I wanted a substitution. I asked for a substitution after the fact and he listed off my options. I went with the sweet potato fries, and although they were good, they were an add on of $4.50. I was quite upset I was not told this, or given a menu when it was time for me to pick my substitution to see the up charges. When I asked about this miscommunication, there was no remorse for me and I was given a grimy New York grin by who seemed to be the manager. About the place: It is super small. Not my cup of tea. The waiters have to pull out the tables from the wall for you to get out from your booth seat. The restaurant should be called Cramped. The food. Other than omitting things from your plate, they will not add things into it. I wanted to make my own scramble, but supposedly everything was ""set"". My food was cold in some places and warm in others (in my scramble). They heated it up in the microwave for 30 seconds, but it was quite the temperature confusion in my mouth when it first came out. The staff: There were only 3 people working. One person being the cook and 2 people on the floor. When we asked for water, one of them was standing 2 feet away on his iphone, and after trying to ask a couple times without him answering, we just waited for the other guy to come around. The price was decent for the area, $9 for a scramble, however, with the $4.50 up charge, I left paying more than what was expected for the meal that I received. All in all, I will not be returning. There are many places to brunch in the city, and this was only a one stop shop for me for sure.",1
2682,7,3,5/4/2014,Stopped by with a friend on a Sunday cause we saw this place has good reviews. Its very small and they try to get you in and out so its a good place if you just want a quick bite. Â I got eggs benedict with salmon and it wasnt too bad. Not bad but not memorable either.,1
2683,7,4,4/27/2014,I ordered the Tuscan chicken and swapped my mash tor a side of rosemary fries. Incredible! Went back the next night for the same dish and was not let down. Only wish I'd known it was Byo the first visit.,1
2684,7,1,4/24/2014,"What is this, the late 80s? Â Is NYC so lacking in delicious, reasonably price restaurants that THIS place gets an inordinate amount of stars? Â Nook is clearly cruising on NYC stupid-inertia, which keeps this place packed and well-rated. Â But if you take your sucker goggles off, you'll notice the prices are ridiculous and the food is of poor quality. Â In particular, the tuna tartare is cat food, the crab cake was hard and dry, the ""goulash"" was just noodles with Prego sauce and few chunks of less-than-prime beef. Â It's also not comfortable. Â That's different than cozy. It's uncomfortable. Go Elsewhere.",1
2685,7,4,4/21/2014,"If the lines weren't long (time wise and ppl wise), I'd give it 5 Excellent brunch menu and drinks. Wish they had a liquor license so I can get my day drinking on! Hook it up at Nook~ Home kitchen feeling--it's rather tiny and cozy place.",1
2686,7,5,4/21/2014,"Nook definitely lives up to its name, seating only 19. I've visited at least 6 times over the last few years and it is always sold out. It is a rare BYO in the city. Meals are consistently excellent, and at a great price point. Steak frites, the rosemary chicken, kebobs, are all worth trying. For a hole in the wall, it doesn't feel too cramped.",1
2687,7,5,4/20/2014,"Tiny place but food is worth the wait. Very fresh ingredients. Staff is quick, efficient and friendly. We had the eggs Benedict and the salad that came with had a fabulous dressing. The potatoes were tasty and the Benedict was killer. Loved it!",1
2688,7,4,4/19/2014,"Got there at 10.30 sat, table within 10min. I rocked the eggs florentine w/salmon. Had a lovely sweet note that added a dimension to this dish not tasted before. Place was tight quick and had an intimate touch - the way we all like it.",1
2689,7,4,4/9/2014,"I've been here twice for dinner. Â My first time was last year in early August and last time mid March of this year. Â I really like this place. Â The BYOB aspect of it is VERY appealing and the food is very delicious. Â Both times I went I got the Tuscan Chicken. Â IT IS BOMB. The chicken is nicely cook, perfectly tender and juicy. Â The sauce is also flavorful, not too salty and you can taste the parmesan but its not overwhelming. Â The mash potatoes are also delicious, the flavor is simply but good. It's very small and can make it a bit annoying to maneuver through. Â Also, the size means you can't really stay and chat after you finish your food because people are waiting for tables. Â Last time i went, the waiter kept looking at us because we took our time eating and kept sipping on the wine we brought. Â He wasn't pushy and after we finished he did politely inform us that there were people waiting so we ended up leaving. Â Despite this, it was still a great place. Â I definitely would go there again. Â The first time i went the waiter was really sweet and made small chit chat with us after we were done. Â He was very friendly and welcoming. Only annoying things about this place, besides the size, are that it is cash only and the lighting sucks in my opinion. Â I think they are trying to go with a laid back subtle lighting but, I don't think they accomplished that well. Â The prices are average, a little bit high, but they are average for nice restaurants and its definitely worth it for the quality of the food, or at least for the meal that I got. Â The complimentary bread is alright.",1
2690,7,3,4/3/2014,"The last time I stepped foot in this tiny restaurant with walls an inviting, deep orange-red was in autumn of 2012 and I had the most wonderful meal - the mood was merry, the ambiance was cozy, only positive things could be said about each dish, and the service was beyond attentive. The cash-only policy was just a minor annoyance. When I revisited last month, I went in expecting that same level of perfection, but left with an ache in my heart. The portions have definitely decreased while the prices have stayed about the same. The mushroom cigars, once as large as spring rolls with thin crispy skin, were replaced with a ""wait, this is it?"" portion with each bite containing more skin than either mushrooms or goat cheese. Our chicken kebab and steak entrees were just okay and were more tough and bland. Even the wining side dishes from last time added to the disappointment. The rosemary fries weren't seasoned with enough of the herb in its name, and the chive mashed potatoes didn't give me the urge to scarf down spoonfuls this time. The service was still warm and attentive and our waiter made us feel at home. The dishes did come out slowly, though. BYO was still lovely. The cash-only policy was not. Â  My first dinner at Nook is a distant, pleasant memory that may never be relived. I know Nook's potential, so I only hope that they can live up to my expectations again one day.",1
2691,7,2,3/29/2014,This place was a lot smaller than I imagined. It was a tight squeeze for the four of us. Â  The staff is very friendly and the food was not bad. Â I had the potato pancakes w/ sausage. Â Pancakes were very dense and sausage a bit dry... This dish needed something else to bring it together.,1
2692,7,5,3/22/2014,"All the space is small (saloon, tables, kitchen) but the brunch and service were excellent.",1
2693,7,1,3/21/2014,"I was in NYC from Boston and at 8 O'clock went onto YELP and found NOOK, looked good so I called and made a reservation Â for Â two people at 8:45. We arrived at 8:45, young hostess and what appeared to be the manager, told us it would be at least another 10 minutes. 10 minutes Â went by and this cranky 47 year old couldn't stand out in the cold sidewalk any longer. There was a young crowd and it is a very small restaurant but they have no concept of how to manage the kitchen and the reservations. We were clearly not going to be seated for quite some time. Have no idea how the food is but operationally there are a mess. Don't make a reservation and expect it to be honored.",1
2694,7,4,3/19/2014,"This place! Such a nice vibe! The food was great, the staff was helpful and friendly. Did I mention it's byob.... we got the tuna sashimi salad, rosemary fries and goulash. Will definitely be returning. It was pretty dead when we were there for a late lunchon Saturday, but the waiter told us that it gets pretty crazy around dinnertime so make a res.",1
2695,7,1,3/18/2014,"Awful! Â Turn around and walk away! Â First time here. Â My dinner was ok (lamb); too sweet for me but my husband's fillet mignon had me jealous. Staff was non existent and when they were around not too accommodating. Â ESPECIALLY WHEN A 2 inch cockroach LANDED on our table as we were paying! Â Showed Â the 'server' who 'tried' to catch it but threw his hands up in the air and 'couldn't find it.' And didnt offer to pay tab!! Â Sooo disgusting! Overall, food ok but service and cleanliness had me wondering how they got the 'A' sanitation standard.",1
2696,7,2,3/9/2014,"Be forewarned - I came here with a party of 3 for brunch/lunch around 12:30 and we waited more than an hour in the cold to be seated without so much a word of warning from the servers that it would be so long. Getting seated as two is much, much faster. But ignoring that, let's get down to the real topic, which is the quality of the food. The three of us each got eggs florentine with smoked salmon and some pierogies to share. NEVER, EVER get the pierogies at Nook. They are absolutely terrible. They look and taste as though they boiled some pierogies out of the frozen boxes from walmart. Absolutely not worth $14 for 8. The eggs florentine were decent. The portions were well-sized and the eggs were well cooked. However, the eggs florentine just didn't stand out for me compared to other brunch places. Nook definitely has some decent food but it certainly wasn't worth the wait.",1
2061,7,5,3/8/2014,"LOVE LOVE LOVE! BYOB plus delicious food! You can't go wrong. Â  My friend had been in a few times and made a reservation for us to go. Â The owner was really nice to us and had reserved enough tables for the 8 of us. Â Yes it's cramped inside and you have to walk through the kitchen to use the bathroom but it's worth it. Â I ordered the soup special (I can't even remember but I loved it and so did everyone else), the burger (the bread was so thick!), and the peanut butter pie with chocolate. Â It was all amazing. Â Really great prices and portions plus BYOB. You just can't go wrong!",1
2697,7,5,3/7/2014,Cute small place. Didn't feel rushed and place had great food. Excellent in my book. New byob dinner spot.,1
2698,7,2,3/4/2014,"I have a pretty good tolerance/patience for service, especially if I know they're busy and understaffed... but this was BY FAR the worst service I have ever experienced. Â Case in point: it took us 15 minutes to get someone to even think about coming to get our order AND another 15 minutes to get them to pour us the coffee we ordered. Â Coffee. Not lattes... not fraps... not capps... plain. black. coffee. I mean, once I get caffeine and some bread in my system, you know that I'll be a happy clam after that. Â The place is tiny - think a closet - with about 20 people inside. Â But whatever, it's NY, you get over it. Â ONE server for all the tables. Again, understandable. The place is a closet. But waiting 15 minutes to order and another 15 for coffee? Nope, sorry, don't get it. Â On the flip side, the food (entrees) were really good... fresh, large portions, exactly what you'd want from brunch. Â But with the service, I'm pretty sure I won't be returning again.",1
2699,7,1,3/2/2014,"I would never recommend this place to anyone. I had to recalculate how much we actually left them, but 16% is what it turned out to be. Hey, I get it, you expect 20%. And no, you did not deserve it. Food service people will always argue about tips, but at the end of the day if someone gave you something above 0, it was to show their gratitude for your service. If you think it's unfair, raise your prices to reflect the service you think you deserve to get paid for. A waiter had the nerve to ask us ""was the service alright because you only left this"". Yes, the service was fine. The place was cold and it we waited at least twice as long as you told us, but the food was good. But you would complain to a customer about a tip, and only a dollar would have made you feel like you were being fairly treated? Holy shit, you just made your customer feel poorly about your establishment over ONE whole dollar? There are a ton of restaurants in the area. And many that have warm cozy, not super-tight spaces with equally if not better food. Please take your business there. Nook does not deserve your business or your one extra dollar. How can you complain about a 16% tip? I don't know but they did!",1
2700,7,3,3/2/2014,"This place is cozy and always packed. My friend that lives in the neighborhood really wanted to try it. We came for a late brunch around 2pm and still waited 15 minutes. The Â staff was friendly. The food was decent, but not sure I understood all the hype. We ordered the perogiees both potato and sauerkraut. They were ok. I had the potato pancakes which were a little dry just alright. My friend had the eggs Benedict which he said were average. We split the peanut butter pie at the end which was the best part of the meal. Not a bad place but a very forgettable meal in a city like New York.",1
2701,7,4,3/1/2014,"Too small, too understaffed, but GREAT food. Awesome burger and amazing rosemary fries, great brunch, and good bread to start. We were seated pretty quickly for a Saturday brunch, but They were slow and maybe forgetful, as they had to be prompted to bring us food. Our party of 4 waited over 45 minutes for our meal. Once we had our food, we were happy! Don't sit by the door if you can help it",1
2702,7,2,2/25/2014,Tight space. I feel intruding into other people space while brunching. I got egg Benedict. The egg was pouched well. But the hollandaise sauce was poorly done. Very watery and no taste to it. It could be better.,1
2703,7,2,2/23/2014,"I will forgive you for not serving mimosas for brunch, but not having soy AND skim milk is just shameful. Â You cannot claim to have a good coffee menu if you only have one milk option. I'm not trying to be a health freak (let's face it we are in manhattan though)-- people can't drink full whole milk for health reasons.",1
2704,7,4,2/22/2014,The decor leaves me wanting more but one of THE BEST grilled rack of lamb I have ever had. It made me want more and I was already full. Way worth the BYOB and CASH ONLY. Â The mushroom cigars were also a big hit at our table. GET THE LAMB!,1
2705,7,3,2/22/2014,"We had Eggs Benedict and pancakes. The food was good, made well but nothing exceptional. Very cozy restaurant and the wait isn't crazy long. We will probably come here again since we are locals but there is nothing extraordinary about it.",1
2706,7,4,2/21/2014,I love Nook. I've been here 3 times already and it's cozy. Plus helps that it's BYOB with no corkage fee. I love their mushroom cigars - they are so good. It's philo dough with a yummy mushroom filling. Their tuna and avocado dish is light and delicious. A perfect yum!,1
2707,7,3,2/17/2014,"I came here for brunch simply out of curiosity: why is it always so packed??? Turns out that the restaurant is tiny, it can probably only fits 20 people. The dining environment is very cozy and the owner(waiter not sure) is very friendly, helping you in and out of your seat. I got egg benedict with Salmon. The food is in good portion with reasonable price. I like the place but I also think this place is overrated given the waiting time and the fact that they don't accept credit card.",1
2708,7,5,2/17/2014,Must try their brunch menu. Is delicious and presentation is exquisite . Small space so usually there's a line.,1
2709,7,1,2/8/2014,"This is a stressfully tiny place. If you're hoping for a relaxing brunch, don't go here. You will be sitting uncomfortably close to strangers. They literally have to MOVE TABLES to let you in and out of your seat, so I hope you don't have to go to the bathroom. If you DO have to go to the bathroom, you'll be walking through their tiny kitchen into their tiny restroom where MY knees touched the wall when sitting on the toilet. So if you're taller than 5'5, I don't know how you'll fit. The food was incredibly overpriced and didn't even taste good. I ordered french toast. French toast is easy. Even I can make french toast. It tasted horrible though. For 9 dollars, I got a teeny tiny portion of bad french toast with a dollop of Cool Whip on the side. $2.50 for barely warm coffee, and I had to keep asking for refills. Basically this place is way too cramped for an enjoyable experience. The prices are ridiculous and the food isn't very good. It's also cash only and they refused to split our check. I won't be coming here again.",1
2710,7,3,2/7/2014,Small hole in the wall. The mushroom appetizer was great but I wasn't super impressed by the food. However there was a cute atmosphere and its Byob!,1
2711,7,4,2/6/2014,"Came here for brunch with a friend one Sunday. Like most yelpers complaint, the place is incredibly small, so don't plan on coming with a group. We waited about 20 min. to get seated. The staff was quick and friendly. Our food came out in no time and was hot and delicious. I ordered the eggs benedict (my favorite) and it was awesome! My friend got an omelette and she loved it. The fresh squeezed orange juice was also fantastic but way over priced (close to $4 for 1 glass!). The only reason I deducted a star is because of the size of the place. I would give 4 1/2 stars if I could. CASH ONLY & BYOB",1
2712,7,5,2/6/2014,"This place is my top choice in the neighborhood. The two chefs (Polish guy and his son) serve up delicious and very attractively priced meals. I highly recommend the Thai-Marinated Grilled Rack of Lamb and the Steak-Frites (a particular favorite, the steak is basted in balsamic reduction and cooked to perfection). Some people complain about the size. That's fair, and certainly if you're coming from a place with more space (e.g. anywhere but NYC) will be striking. That said, just temper your expectations. It's possible you might overhear your neighbor's conversation. It's possible there'll be an obnoxious party a few tables (read: feet) down from you. Sure. That said, you'll get to experience really good food at really good prices in a genuine, neighborly, family-owned place. BYOB is excellent and has no corking fee. Just be aware that the place is cash-only. Oh, and Ramon is hands down the best waiter I've ever had anywhere. Nook is very much worth a visit. Or many.",1
2713,7,5,2/3/2014,Had a really lovely time here. Excellent tuna & steak & good host. Hard to find a decent BYOB place but this one was high quality. Would recommend calling first.,1
2714,7,3,1/24/2014,"My favourite thing about Nook is that it's a cozy little brunch spot with lovely staff members, and it's great to curl up in on a cold winter morning. The wait isn't too long, considering how tiny the place is. The coffee is good, and the food is average. I had a Croque Monsieur, and was slightly disappointed to receive a grilled cheese (though perhaps we get better French food in Canada....I'm thinking I may have eaten an American style Croque Monsieur...). The smoked salmon dishes were lovely.",1

2717,7,3,1/18/2014,First time at this place. Food is good but the place is very small. I was surprised to find there is no usual brunch drinks and CASH only!,1
2718,7,3,1/14/2014,"The food here is decent, but the crowded, fire-hazardous conditions are enough to make me steer clear of Nook forever. Â Byob or not, no one should subject themselves to such cramped quarters. Â I came here on a blustery day and people were continuously pouring in to check on availability of tables, rendering the tiny restaurant completely frigid. Â  My sympathy goes out to the unfortunate individuals who get seated at the table located right by the door. Â There was a couple trying to enjoy their meal on the night of my visit, but the door was constantly slamming against his chair and elbow every time it opened (which, believe me, was often). Â There was also a large party seated by one wall, where two of the males in the group could not fit both their legs underneath the table. Â They were in permanent plie pose for the night. Â I'm sure that neither of the aforementioned seating arrangements could have been comfortable.... My group of three was seated at a booth that was about to fall apart. Â The wooden ""booth"" was shaking and we could feel the backrest prying loose from the wall. Â After we were settled for about 15 minutes; however, a group of 5 came in so they asked us to relocate to an even smaller table. I guess the upside was sitting in secure chairs where we didn't fear for our safety. Â  The waiter, while polite and very accommodating, was unfortunately the only waiter for the whole restaurant. Â It was obvious he was working very hard and trying to manage a variety of tasks at once so major props to him. Â But consequently, what this translated into was very spotty and slow service. Â It was evident that the restaurant should either cut down on max. capacity or hire additional staff to assist. Again, I have to reiterate that the food here is good, but dining out encompasses a holistic experience and I was pretty disappointed with several aspects of my meal here.",1
2719,7,4,1/11/2014,"Came here for brunch while waiting for a 2 PM show. It was crowded as I expected, but the wait went by pretty quickly and we were seated by the door. (Which did not blow open once! [/myth busters moment] ) After browsing the photos on Yelp, I decided I would try the infamous smoked salmon, cream cheese and scallion egg scramble that kept on showing up and was not disappointed. The hash browns were soft and mushy, but I like things that look like baby food so I wasn't complaining. Â Overall, a good experience. The only downsides being how small the place was (however tiny you're imagining it to be right now, shrink it down by two) and the fact that you actually have to move the table aside if you're seated on the inside and want to get out.",1
2026,7,3,1/5/2014,"Stopped in for brunch today. This is a THREE star spot, not four. The food is well portioned and well priced, but average in taste. I found the potato pancakes to be very greasy with a gray color center and lacking that crisp exterior, but the smoked sausage was great. The croque monsieur was more like hot ham and cheese. The cheese was in between the slices of bread rather than melted on top and it needed more of that melted butter finish. Although I didn't try it, the French toast looked yummy with a nice cinnamon coating and strawberry puree to drizzle on top. As others have stated, the place seats 20 max and if you don't arrive before 1030 am, expect a wait. They kindly accommodated my group of 6 today, but they don't like to hold tables so best to show up with your complete party. Beware that sitting near the front door in the cold months is miserable because the door doesn't close on its own. To end on a positive note, it's BYOB.",1
2720,7,4,12/31/2013,"Solid 4.5 stars. Nook is a crazily crowded and tiny space that doesn't take reservations. But the quality per dollar ratio is just incredible. I've only gone for dinner but the food was super fresh and delicious. We had two appetizers: the mushroom cigars and tuna tartar. While the cigars were delicious, flaky and crunchy-- the real star was the tartar. Imagine: sashimi grade tuna, topped with avocado and finished with a generous drizzle of truffle oil. The tuna was extremely fresh (as fresh as some of the top sushi establishments!) and the truffle oil bought out extra umami from the raw fish. The main courses were nothing to be sneezed at either. The 12oz filet mignon was a steal in the mid $20's and cooked perfectly medium rare. The pork chops were a bit overcooked and not as good as the lamb, but the sweet potatoes fries that came with it redeemed the entree. The mixture of crunchy, salty, sweet goodness dipped in rich chipotle mayo ticked off all check boxes. Recommendations: - tuna tartar - must get! - mushroom cigars - filet mignon - on par with a steakhouse (at half the price) - lamb chops - sweet potato fries - nom nom **TIP: It is BYOB. There's a liquor shop just down the block that offers a selection of vino if you've forgotten your bottle.",1
2721,7,5,12/30/2013,"I love Nook. It's in my neighbourhood and cosy and tiny and sweet. It features ""New American"" food and is BYOB - so is great for saving your pennies in this way. The wait staff is lovely, and the owner who sometimes serves as well might let you play your iPod on the speaker system at the end of the night, so you can dance til they finish cleaning up. Their brunch menu has yummy potato pancakes and a salmon dish. Their other menus include mushroom cigars - greasy but great, and other nice meat/fish/veg edibles. It's great for a date spot, and if you have reservations - for a group. All round win.",1
1011,7,4,12/18/2013,"3.5 stars Well-priced, small and cozy restaurant in the Hell's Kitchen. We stopped by for brunch on a Saturday around 11AM -- no wait, but it was freezing outside. Potato pancakes weren't the hash brown-y + apple sauce pancakes I was expecting. They were more like Indian fritters with a spicy cajun tomato sauce and sausages. I didn't love it, but the males in my company did. I'd recommend the egg scrambles. Apple pancakes were also a hit with the guys, mostly because they weren't that sweet. I prefer sweet :)",1
2722,7,3,12/12/2013,"The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 5 is because the space is just a tad too tight for my liking. Other than that, I love everything about it! A friend and I literally stumbled upon this place randomly. No really, I tripped while walking and looked up, voila! It was an early, cold morning and we decided to give it a try after approving of the menu items on the menu attached to the window. Evidently we decided just in time because we got the last available table and as we were leaving there was a line of ppl wrapped around the corner. Standing in the cold smh. So I had the French toast w/strawberry coulis and it was delicious.",1
2723,7,4,12/4/2013,"Came here after seeing a show. Â Very friendly owner, who was quick with a recommendation and attended to our every need even though he had no help at the time. Â It's Bring Your Own Beverage, Â a huge plus in my mind, and there is a decent wine store up the road. Â It's been too long for me to remember exactly what I ordered - I need to write these reviews in a more timely fashion - but I remember liking the food and the quaint atmosphere. Â I would definitely come back.",1

Â I came with my fambam--there were five of us and we all fit, though I was elbow to elbow with my cousin and my hubby. Â When the door opens, you most likely will feel a rush of cold air, as all the tables are somewhat close to the door since it's a small place. However, we had a wonderful dining experience. Â Part of the reason was because of the company, but the food is delicious! and decently priced. Â It is CASH ONLY. Â I recommend the potato pancakes with smoked salmon (~$12). Â This dish is amazing! Â The potato pancakes are very savory, topped with sour cream, capers, green onions, and smoked salmon (or ham, depending on which you choose). Â They give a nice modest portion of salad between (if I remember correctly) 5 potato pancakes, each the size of a person's palm. Â The eggs benedict is pretty good too. Â As a side note, the home fries are actually mashed potatoes, but they are delicious! The fresh squeezed orange juice comes in a small wine glass, but is apparently delicious.",1
2725,7,4,12/1/2013,I am a fan of this place. Fod was absolutely delicious and it was prepared very fast.,1
2726,7,2,11/24/2013,"Went here for dinner before a play on Saturday night. Chose a table at the front by the windows, which was a mistake. Their front door doesn't close properly, so it became my job to shut it for the hour we were dining. On a cold night like the night we were there, it got annoying fast. Directly in front of the restaurant, which runs for several blocks N and S on 9th Ave., is a big NYC water main job. So the scenery is awful. The space as really cramped, and there are way too many tables for its small size. The redeeming factor is the food. The filet mignon is wicked. Service is very good too. No liquor license, so byob. No espresso either. I'd not recommend Nook at peak dining hour on the weekend. Go later, or during the week. Cheers.",1
2727,7,3,11/21/2013,"Nook is okay. I went with friends on a Saturday morning at 11am. We waited 15 minutes for a table. Tip: If you're starving, enjoy a slice of dollar slice of pizza next door while you wait. The menu is reasonable: $8.95 for each of the scramble plates. Service is also good: Friendly and attentive. The food, however, is not that good. You get better flavor and portions at a nearby diner. The coffee is nothing special either. Then again, the price seems right, so I can't complain too much. A-OK.",1
2728,7,2,11/13/2013,"This place is really cute unless it's cold outside. He had the door locked so we couldn't get in, then came running out. He sat us right in the window which was awesome until we realized the front door protecting us from the 30F degree winds didn't shut all the way when opened, so my boyfriend had to turn around and close the door over twenty times (not an exaggeration). The owner saw it and didn't seem to mind that his customers kept doing this. The food was fine - nothing memorable, nothing I wouldn't have again. I asked the owner (who was our server) for a recommendation and he recommended the most expensive thing on the menu. Fine, we ordered it. Meh. Then at dessert, the owner left the restaurant for over 25 minutes. We sat for almost that entire time waiting for our check. I was tempted to leave cash on the table and walk out. Ultimately, my conscious got the best of me and we waited. It's BYOB and the food is fine - I'd come back again on a warmer day.",1
2729,7,1,11/2/2013,"Really Nook, after 3 great times, you let me down when I came with 4 friends. 45 min wait and the host kept saying ""5 more minutes!"". We left after 50 min to hit Thai Noodle.",1
2730,7,1,10/28/2013,"After reading all of the excellent reviews for this place I made a reservation for dinner for my boyfriend and I on Friday night. Our reservations were for 9:00 and when we arrived on time we were told he would have a table for us shortly, within 15 minutes. Instead of hovering over the diners enjoying their meal we left our phone number and decided to circle the block until our table was ready. After 20 minutes without a call we returned to the restaurant to find two parties of 4 waiting outside to also be seated. Now there were 10 people waiting to enter this small restaurant and after another 20 minutes of waiting outside we discovered that the two parties had 8:30 reservations and that inevitably we would be waiting quite a while until they were sat before us. The two parties were seated around 9:45 (1 hour and 15 minutes after their reservations) At 10:05 we saw a table leave the restaurant and we entered thinking that it would finally be our turn to be seated. NOPE! The owner gave our table away to a gentlemen waiting no where near as long as us. He said he would have another table for us shortly to which we replied that was what we were told over an hour ago and exited the restaurant to take our business elsewhere. Oh and let me also mention that another couple entered the restaurant without reservations and were charged at by the manger with he finger wagging 'No way, not tonight"". They knowingly overbook this restaurant and pay no mind to leaving you waiting in the cold for hours. RUDE, ABYSMAL SERVICE!",1
2731,7,4,10/27/2013,This place is great! Live in the 'hood and have been meaning to go for brunch forever. Only four stars Â because of the wait- the place only has 10 tables- but the food was delicious and very reasonably priced. Definitely recommend.,1
2732,7,4,10/24/2013,"BYOB. And by BYOB I mean bring a few good close friends that you willing to get closer to (cause the space is tight and you will be close), a couple of bottles of bubbly, and great conversation. This has become an easy go to spot on my brunch list. Oh and the french toast! Amazing! Fruit salad is pretty darn good too. Ps this place is CASH ONLY! Bring your dollar bills!",1
2733,7,4,10/23/2013,"Great food. Â I hate waiting though, I was told the wait would be 10 to 15 minutes. Â We ended up waiting for 35 minutes, understandably, the place is tiny, as most other places. Â But the food was worth the wait.",1
2734,7,4,10/21/2013,"Deciding to take our brunch hunt uptown, boyfriend and I left our New Jersey/West Village safe zones and went up to Hell's Kitchen for our midmorning meal. We chose a goodie with this one. It's not called ""nook"" for nothing. The place is tiny. Seriously. But they do a surprisingly good job of economizing that space. My luck with my past weekend has been continuing to go to places with really weird music mixes and this one fit the bill as well. Cyndi Lauper's ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" and Vivaldi's Primavera? If you insist, Nook. The food was delicious. Since I wasn't feeling too breakfast-y, I got the veggie sandwich with rosemary fries and coffee. The eggplant was so good and the rosemary fries were really interesting. Boyfriend got the burger and it was HUGE. Seriously. He seemed to like it but he's not the biggest burger person. I would eat here again, yes yes.",1
2735,7,5,10/19/2013,"As always...out of town and hungry we turned to yelp. Â 500 4 star reviews helped us choose Nook for lunch. Â The name fits - as it really is a nook. We walked past it as it is only about 15 or 20 feet wide (sorry, I'm not a surveyor). Â There is only seating for about 25 +/- so it is even more amazing that they have 500 reviews... I had the Ahi Tuna salad - it was great. Fresh, good dressing in just the right proportion. My pickiest daughter had the chicken kabobs. Soft, juicy and really flavorful. My a little less picky daughter had the chicken sandwich. Finally, my wife had the smoked salmon sandwich. I almost forgot to mention their rosemary fries. They were really, really great. If you are looking for a casual meal, go here! Â All 4 of us voted for 5 stars. Â  (which says a lot since there is no beer and if you've read any of my other reviews that is a must for me)",1
2736,7,4,10/16/2013,"CASH ONLY - Bring cash. better yet, bring a date with cash This place is small, cramped, and hot - these are the only faults I could find. The service is friendly and quick. The owner is also your server. Respect to the owner getting down and dirty. The star of the meal was definitely the food. Came here for brunch and had the cream cheese, salmon, and scallion scramble and my date got the croquet monsieur. Portions were huge and delicious. If you want solid food and bang for your buck - this place is for you. If you are claustrophobic or want credit card points - avoid this place.",1
2737,7,5,10/15/2013,I love this place. I don't live in NY anymore but I still dream about the lamb chop and tuna tartar here.,1
2738,7,5,10/8/2013,"So delicious!! The mushroom cigars are out of this world. I have tried almost every entree and have never been disappointed (i suggest trying the lamb chops). The restaurant is tiny, reasonably priced and BYOB - note beforehand it is cash only.",1
2739,7,4,10/7/2013,"Ate brunch here over the weekend and got the potato pancakes with sausage and tomato pepper salsa. Â The texture of the pancakes was perfect - crunchy on the edges and warm in the middle - and the sausage was absolutely delicious. Â Everything was flavored perfectly. Â Our server was extremely friendly, and they didn't charge us extra for the side of sour cream that my friend requested. Â I can't wait to try their dinner menu! Â  It's kind of tiny, and the bathroom is awkwardly situated at the back of the kitchen, and it can be not so fun when people have to get past your table to get to their own, but the service and the food make the odd space more than worth it.",1
2740,7,1,10/2/2013,Very disappointed. I went this restaurant because the positive reviews on Yelp. The service was very bad. Even no orange juice at this restaurant. I ordered salmon sandwich and soup. They were just OK.,1
2741,7,1,9/22/2013,"So I call to make a reservation and was pleasantly surprised to find availability. We get there at 7:30 after paying for a cab ride, sit down and wait at least 15 mins for someone to take a drink order. At some point during the order process one of our party of 6 decides to ask what credit cards the restaurant accepts at which point the waiter informs us that they are cash only!!!!!! Did it ever occur to these folks that some people don't carry cash? Wouldn't it have been a great idea to tell me that when I made the reservation or post it on the front door or SOMETHING???? Thank goodness we asked and found out before we ordered and could leave since we didn't have enough cash to pay for the meal! An hour and lots of walking later we finally sat down for dinner.....at a place that accepts credit cards! What an inconvenience!",1
2742,7,4,9/22/2013,"Cash only and BYO. We ordered the mushroom cigars. They were really the highlight of the meal. The place it small, so I can see why there would be a wait. I called in advance and they reserved a table for 3 for us even though we ran maybe 10-15 minutes late (bad habit, working on it). I ordered the burger. Will be back again!",1
2743,7,3,9/16/2013,"Needed a brunch option and had a time crunch so we relied on our trusty Yelp friends to steer us in the right direction. An average of four stars and proximity to our hotel made Nook a winner for the moment. While we enjoyed the Parisian feel of the very small restaurant, my friends and I thought the food was only okay, nothing exceptional. My eggs benedict were good enough, but not great. We did appreciate the unexpected ""home fries,"" which more closely resembled mashed potatoes. This item was arguably one of the best things any of us had that morning. My friend's french toast wasn't bad but wasn't great either. Our server was amusingly nonchalant and slightly snooty, but he got all the orders right and delivered them in a timely manner, so I guess he was alright. I'd go here again for the sidewalk cafe atmosphere and people/dog-watching.",1
2744,7,1,9/15/2013,"I'm sure the food is great but I didn't get a chance to try it. I went in on a Sunday and was immediately refused in an exceptionally rude manner because there was a private party. Maybe next time instead of yelling at potential customers for coming in they should put a sign outside that says ""private party"".",1
2745,7,4,9/14/2013,"Pros Â  1. Great food 2. Small place charm 3. Great Food 4. Reasonable Prices Cons 1. Place is Tiny and the wait could be long 2. Service is ok at best, thats even by NYC standards.",1
2746,7,4,9/11/2013,"This is a cozy little spot with nice food. Â It is b.y.o.b. with no corking fee providing each person is ordering at least $15 worth of food, which shouldn't be a problem considering the prices at the restaurant. Â The food was a much higher quality than the venue itself appeared. Â When the dishes arrived I could easily picture them being brought out by a waiter dressed in all black to a candlelit table near someone playing the piano to add to the overall ambiance. Â Instead it was a very nice guy in a graphic tee and shorts bringing out our meal. Â A nice little date spot, just plan ahead of time and bring a bottle ,enjoy dinner and a couple drinks before going out for the rest of the evening. Â I would not recommend bringing a large group as there is limited seating.",1
2747,7,4,9/4/2013,"Food was great. I dont remember what i got, but it was good. There is a $15 min, and everyone in your party needs to order food. The restaurant is really small, but we didnt have to wait too long. The server was really nice and very personable. Since it is such a small place he only had a couple tables to take care of, so you got attention. I'd come back here, I enjoyed the freedom of bringing your own booze!",1
2748,7,1,9/3/2013,"Seriously, I'm stunned. How has this restaurant garnered so many positive reviews. Are people that drawn to the option of zero corkage fees? For my part, Nook was just awful from start to finish. First, the place is small, hot, dirty and staffed by one server/host who just can't seem to keep up (and the restaurant was half full). Second, the bathroom is actually through the kitchen. Perhaps it's not that big of a deal, but there's only one bathroom for men and women, and unfortunately, no where to wait if it's in use. It depressing, really, because it leaves one forced to watch the disorganized kitchen staff muddle around in greasy environs. Alas, the worst is yet to come: the food. I was en route to leave the restaurant a 'meh' rating after very average appetizers when I was served the entree: duck. It's worth stating that duck is my favorite dish and Nook somehow manage to mangle it. Â The food was dry, rubbery, and tasteless. I wondered if it was just my dish, but two others at the table ordered the same entree and theirs appeared equally mediocre. I think that people must be raving about this place for brunch because dinner was catastrophic. Next time, I'll gladly pay corkage NOT to eat at Nook. PS - Don't get me started on dessert.",1
2749,7,4,8/25/2013,"3.5 stars for me - but it gets boosted up to 4 stars because I like the small and charming feel of this BYOB brunch place, unlike many brunch places in the area. This place is pretty tiny, but since we came close to the opening time, we had about a 15 minute wait for a table for 2. The brunch is solid and feels almost homemade, in a good way. Really enjoyed the french toast that was moist and came with a raspberry sauce on the side. Enjoyed the potato pancake topped with sausage - the potato cake was a tad greasy, but still good. Really enjoyed the rosemary french fries - had a great crunch to it. Overall, enjoyed my brunch here, but not enough to come back again soon.",1
2750,7,5,8/25/2013,"Got right in and had a wonderful experience. Nice people, good wine (well, we brought it) and we weren't rushed. I got the steak (medium rare) which was closer to rare. We also got the tuna. The steak was better than the tuna, but we enjoyed both. Also, the price is pretty reasonable.",1
2751,7,2,8/18/2013,"I was let down by the reviews. 4 of us went. Â The service was rushed and the waiter/owner? Didn't seem personable at all. Always rushes. The mushroom roll appetizers were quite good. That's where it ends. The mains were lacklustre. The chicken souvlaki is one skewer with some cheap plain fries and a touch of some salad. Â We all agreed the chicken was over cooked and dried out. The Tuscan chicken was decent, although there was generic mashed potatoes and salad that also came with the salmon. Â The salmon was a tiny 4oz filet, plainly prepared. I'd strongly recommend you try somewhere else unless the free corkage is a game changer for you.",1
2752,7,5,8/17/2013,"Good service and food. Â Very low key and small. Â We had the salad with carmelized pears, mushroom cigars, salmon, filet mignon, cheeseburger and chicken kabobs. Â Everything, including the sides (cucumber salad side and rosemary frites) were really good. It s BYOB.",1
2753,7,4,8/16/2013,"+Great Service +BYOB Brunch +Decent Food -Tiny Space -Wait if you're not early Came here with a few friends a many, many bottles of wine. Â It's one of those places where I may have a meal here but remember nothing of it - but given the ""BYOB"" part, it ",1
2754,7,1,8/13/2013,"Well, I wish I would be able to review the food but that'd be impossible since I haven't eaten there last time I went. Reason is, I was left waiting for my table along with 3 other friends for 45 min and when a 4 person table freed up, it was given away to one single person who just arrived but was obviously the friend of the waiter (that bald effeminate dude who usually does the seating). When raising this issue to him, we were just told to wait maybe 20 more minutes since another table might become available. Pure disrespectful attitude.",1
2755,7,4,8/10/2013,I had a great delicious lunch here. Â The mushroom soup was amazing. The roast hockey sandwich was good. The bread was chewy but I like that. I had a pile of crispy golden fries. Drink is extra. Coke was $3 it's NYC.,1
2756,7,4,8/4/2013,This place is great. Â I had the Eggs Florentine and a friend had the scrambled eggs with sausage. Â The freshly squeezed juice was a nice touch to the meal. Â  They only accept cash and the place can make anyone feel claustrophobic. Â Don't bring more than one other person.,1
2757,7,4,7/16/2013,"Fantastic BYOB- tough to find in midtown area. CASH ONLY. Mushroom cigars were fantastic as echoed in other reviews. Entrees were great--- Not a 5 because very hot in the summer and no AC-- but really loved the feeling of the restaurant--- especially if you are with excellent company, as I was :)",1
2758,7,5,7/13/2013,"Enjoyed our dinner at NOOK tonight. Â We started off with the Mushroom Cigars and Tuna Tartar. Â Absolutely Yummy. Three of us had the Filet Mignon and the other had Tuscan Chicken. Â It was all delicious. Â Our waiter was very welcoming and attentive. Â This was our first trip, but not our last. Â Already looking forward to our time back in NYC in October. FYI - Cash Only and BYOB.",1
2759,7,5,7/12/2013,Awesome breakfast and dinner! Â Highly suggest Tuna Tartar and the Hot Chocolate.,1
2760,7,4,7/12/2013,First tip: It's cash only! Second: It's tiny! Don't expect a lot of personal space! I loved that it was BYOB with no corking fee. The food was amazing -- I'd highly recommend the Tuscan Chicken!,1
2761,7,5,7/11/2013,"Been here a few times and just needed to make sure that my gut feeling was right before writing a review. Firstly, BYOB. No cork fee. Need a say more? Secondly, the food is really, REALLY good! I've had a few of their entrees now and each one is more delicious than the next. Filet: melts in your mouth. Burger: ermigerd so good. Tuscan chicken: sploooooooge! Thirdly, decent price for a high quality meal. There are too many places that offer ""meh"" quality food at prices that make me regret eating there. At Nook, you'll find this the opposite is true. Lastly, it's a very small, nice, intimate place; so don't be afraid to bring a date here. It's not overly-romantic (which is sometimes preferred) and you can make a good impression without breaking the bank. If you're thinking group, any more than 4 is too much. I've yet to try their brunch menu but if it's anything like dinner, it should be great.",1
2762,7,3,7/8/2013,"I'm not sure what the hype about this place is all about to be honest with you. Is it cause they're BYOB?? Food was good, don't get me wrong, but there's definitely better in Hell's Kitchen. The servings were all adequately sized and fairly priced. The owner/waiter/dude did everything was super nice and almost makes me feel bad for only giving the three stars but alas, I must be honest. Place is small and cramped I thought and always full, so hard to just walk in. Not sure if they take reservations. I dont know. If I'm in the area, I'd probably go somewhere else but if you see an open table, go right on in! You won't be disappointed, you'll have a nice meal!",1
2763,7,5,7/8/2013,"Hubby and I came to Nook for brunch in a hot hot NYC summer day. We ordered the peppered tuna salad and Benedict eggs with smoked salmon. The food was simple but very tasty. The ingredients were fresh, so a little moderate seasoning could bring out the flavors. Â The bread was amazing. I just hope I can have the opportunity to eat here again soon!",1
2764,7,4,7/7/2013,"I really enjoyed my dinner at Nook. Â The staff is very welcoming and friendly. Â We were seated immediately. Â We had the mushroom cigars for an appetizer which were awesome. Â These were definitely the best part of the meal. Â I had the chicken kebabs--they were decent, not great. Â I felt that the chicken was over-cooked. Â My husband had the lamb which he thought was pretty good. Â  For the price, this place is especially great: the food is decent and it's byo. Â I'd definitely love to come back for brunch.",1
2765,7,5,7/3/2013,"This review is long over due. I took my friend here for her birthday and before she arrived, I told the owner (who is the sweetest person ever), that it was her birthday and was looking for a dessert to order. I told him she didn't like chocolate and even though all he had for the apple pie, was chocolate ice cream... he had someone run out to get vanilla. So nice. We then started to eat, as I'm sure you've gathered by now, it's BYOB (which is awesome). The food is really homey, simple, and refined - very good. We tried the mushroom cigars, which are HIGHLY recommended. We also tried the salmon and crab cake special... both were really delicious. After dinner, Ramon was banging on his glass saying ""Can I have everyone's attention please, it's Grace's Birthday, please help me sing to her"" and he whips out a beautiful apple pie with vanilla ice cream and a candle... the whole restaurant sang to her. It was the cutest thing ever and my friend was so surprised and delighted. The service is totally exceptional here, the food is lovely, and the place is very cozy and intimate. Make a reservation since it's small, and bring Cash only and some wine :) I can't wait to come back for brunch. What a stellar experience, just writing about it puts me in a good mood.",1
2766,7,5,6/24/2013,Great food and very consistent. They also have one of the best burgers in town. They come with scrumptious Rosemary Fries. It is a very small space so make a reservation if you have a large group on the weekend. Service has always been great. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,1
2767,7,3,6/22/2013,"This place was okay - the best parts were the BYOB policy (be aware that everyone needs to order one entree in order to partake in the BYOB) and the open-air feel. The food was okay - nothing great, considering the price.",1
2768,7,4,6/14/2013,"Cute little BYOB. Â Mushroom Cigars were delicious and the burger was cooked perfectly. Â We didn't order dessert but the table next to us did and it made me wish i did.

Â ""Medium?"" he asks, ""Yes"", Â Comes out Well Done, no pink in sight, texture of a hockey puck. Â So I guess not ""everything"", eh chef?",1
2770,7,5,6/12/2013,"I have one word for you Ramon! You have to make a reservation so while you are at it make sure Ramon is working.

It's good for a dinner date - Or you can walk in around 9:30-10PM when it's not as busy! The tuna tartare was a good sized portion for sharing and worth the $8.50. I ordered the Konrad's Goulash. Tasted homey and had a slight kick to it - so good! My boyfriend had the chicken kebabs because they were out of the Tuscan Chicken (a lot of people suggested this dish). The kebabs weren't very tasty and the rosemary fries were just french fries - nothing spectacular.",1

But what was most amazing at this restaurant was Ramon, his service was beyond anything else I could imagine and I was lucky to meet him as he only works on Saturdays, Â but he brought that place to life and made you feel comfortable and at home.

2774,7,5,6/2/2013,"I came here expecting a tiny mom and pop diner situation, and this place absolutely blew my socks off. I came in for brunch on a Saturday, and while this place is small, we were lucky enough to get in without a wait. They serve you a mini basket of bread and butter, which is awesome (unless you're gluten free like my dining partner). I ended up ordering the smoked salmon hash, and it was amazing. They didn't serve it super smokey, but more lox-styled which went really well with the light lemony flavor of the Hollandaise. It also came with a tiny side salad (SO good! Glad they didn't overdo it on the dressing like most places do), and a side of mashed potatoes (maybe regular mixed with sweet potatoes or butternut squash?) Either way, I was thoroughly impressed. Out of the 8 places I've eaten in the city so far, this one is definitely the best. The staff are super nice and friendly to boot!",1

Next time in NYC we will be back.",1
2776,7,3,5/29/2013,"Quick review: 1. It was tiny restaurant. Sits 10 people maybe. 2. It's so tiny that you have to walk pass the kitchen to go pee. 3. Don't sit next to the door. 4. Cash only. 5. The nutella baguette was not worth it. 6. Its BYOB as many other said, for the nubcakes it means Bring Yo Own Beverage (Biatch!). 7. Everything tastes homemade (ahem, I'm trying to say it tastes amateur), which is what you should expect if you come here. 8. A Nay for me, too many brunch alternative around the neighborhood.",1
2777,7,4,5/22/2013,"Delicious food. Delightful service (Ramon is amazing). Friendly atmosphere. Tuna tartare, chicken kebabs, and spicy shrimp were all great, and I really enjoyed the braised cabbage and rosemary fries.

2778,7,4,5/22/2013,"My boyfriend and I came here on our trip to Manhattan and we were not disappointed. Â  The restaurant space is very small, but that gave it character.

2780,7,2,5/17/2013,"The reason we went to Nook was to enjoy some BYOB - which, coincidentally, is the only reason to go to Nook. The place is tiny but at 6pm on a Thursday we had no trouble getting a table. I ordered the peppered steak tuna salad and it was very disappointing. I felt like they rolled the tuna in pepper, sliced up some avocado and called it a day. For 17$ I expected more. My friend wanted to get an appetizer since she wasn't hungry but their BYOB policy is that each party must spend $15 - so she had to order a main dish. I would not go back. Next time we want some BYOB in Midtown we'll take a picnic in Bryant Park.",1
2781,7,5,5/12/2013,Amazing. This may have been our best meal in NYC and it was for breakfast! Â The French toast with raspberry coulis was fantastic. Good coffee. Good service.,1
2782,7,4,5/8/2013,"Delicious!!!!! Nook lives up to its name--a small little nook in Hell's Kitchen. It seats about 18 people and everyone is almost on top of one another. It's like sitting at a large cafeteria table. They don't take reservations, but the wait is not very long on weekends. Do not come here with more than 2 people. It will triple the wait time!! The apple pancakes are to die for!!!! They are absolutely delicious--large slices of apple melted into a large fluffy pancake!!! The egg dishes are also great. This place is BYO so it's a good place to go at night with a bottle of wine. Only negative is that Nook is cash only.",1
2783,7,2,4/20/2013,"-The food is good but nothing to write home about but got the job done. Shrimp and lamb were both overcooked. -Fairly reasonable prices -Ambiance is lacking. I know this is New York but there was probably 4"" between the tables (I'm not exaggerating). -I'm",1
2784,7,4,4/17/2013,"Nook is like a small Village restaurant in the heart of the theater district...and best of all, it's BYOB! I came here for brunch with my girlfriends one Sunday, and I was very impressed by the cost and freshness of the food. I returned last night for dinner and was again impressed by both things. At our server's recommendation, I had the salmon, which was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The chive mashed potatoes were also a hit. I tried the pepper encrusted tuna, which was good, but a bit too peppery for me. The salad it came with was just mixed greens, but it had an absolutely delicious and light vinaigrette. On the down side, the place is so small that you're practically sitting on top of your neighbors, and every time the door opens a gust of cold air blows in. Also, our wine glasses were wet when they were put on the table. But overall, Nook is a neighborhood gem! UPDATE: I liked this place so much that I looked into having a birthday dinner there. Other reviewers noted that group dinners were difficult to schedule, but since the reviews weren't recent, I went ahead and tried to schedule the dinner. I called on Tuesday afternoon, and I was told the best day to make reservations is Thursday and that I could try to call back tomorrow, but there's no guarantee someone could help me then either. I just think that is no way to run a business. If I'm trying to spend money at your establishment, you should help me do it! There are no hard feelings, and I'm sure I'll return, but I am planning the dinner elsewhere. Nook, please work on that reservation system!",1
2785,7,4,4/17/2013,"My friends and I love coming here for our weekly girls night and between all of us, we've tried almost everything on the dinner menu. The mushroom cigars are very good and I recommend the lamb and chicken, I could have licked the plate after these meals. It's also BYOB with no corkage fee if everyone orders an entree. Only problems are it's cash only and small so making reservations ahead of time is a must. I will say if you show up unannounced, they usually try to accommodate you. I've also been here for brunch once and it was nice because they opened the windows for the summertime breeze but it wasn't the best brunch I've ever had. The brunch food was good but nothing spectacular.",1
2786,7,4,4/15/2013,"I love Nook. I'm from Houston and every time I visit New York I make it a point to drop by for dinner one night. I usually go for the lamb, which is delicious and exceeded my expectations. The staff is incredibly friendly and we almost always end up chatting with them for a portion of the night. It's cash only and BYOB - so each time we go we grab a couple bottles of wine on the way over. The place itself is tiny, which adds to its intimate atmosphere. However, if you need the restroom, you have to walk through the kitchen in the back to one. Sometimes there is a wait and during the winter months it isn't very fun having to huddle outside since there isn't waiting room indoors, but in the end it's worth it. I recommend trying it!",1
1192,7,4,4/15/2013,"Decided to meet someone here for Brunch since it's in midtown and she's from some place north of the Bronx and I'm in Brooklyn. Â Good enough reason to finally take this off my bookmark for the longest time. Â First off, there is no list of names for brunch. Â You wait in line. Â Old School. Â We arrived around 11:30, and the wait was approximately 15min for the two of us. Â Not too bad I guess. The food. Â Awesome. Â Soup of the Day was Cauliflower and it was real nice and clean. Â Sourdough bread and salty butter (though a lil too hard) was nice. Â One look at the menu (and it's prices) you know you're going to have a great meal. Â I was actually a little embarrassed to admit these prices were lower than that of my neighborhood of Park Slope. Â My Nook eggs with Smoked Sausage (didn't know it was blended together, which was a neat change of pace) was great - though the ""home fries"" were just mashed potato. Â Weird. Â Friend's French toast isn't very memorable but the tart Raspberry sauce on the side makes it a little interesting. Â Another slight gripe would be that the waiter forgot my coffee. Will definitely be back to try dinner service.",1
2787,7,3,4/13/2013,"2.5 stars. Nice little hole in the wall spot, but their lunch was pretty average. I picked out Nook because I wanted brunch, but they stop serving breakfast pretty early on weekdays. Â It's a tiny, tiny restaurant with basically two people working. Â Service is fine, but obviously constrained by the number of staff. I ordered the lunch special with a cup of soup, smoked salmon baguette, and rosemary fries. Â My friend ordered the goulash. Â Both were decent, although the goulash was a bit expensive for lunch. Â My sandwich tasted fine, but the bread was a bit stiff and I could have used more salmon. Â The rosemary fries are good. Overall, the lunch was fine but nothing special. Â The lunch special is priced reasonably, but the menu overall isn't particularly cheap for what it is. Â It's an ok choice for lunch if you're in the area, but keep in mind they don't accept credit cards.",1
2788,7,4,4/9/2013,"Woke up from an amazing evening at the Hilton Inn in Times Square and found this hole in the wall spot with Siri. Upon arrival the restaurant was empty and the chef was prepping his kitchen. We were told to sit anywhere we like. There was construction outside and with the doors open it was quite bothersome, but with the doors closed (thank you chef) the ambiance of Nook shines through. Rag time music pours into your ears while a home style American menu greets you with a diverse offering. A great escape as long as it isn't packed.",1

2790,7,3,3/31/2013,"Cash Only! Probably the best brunch in Hell's Kitchen (Not many to choose from..) Incredibly small quarters inside, so there's always a wait outside on weekends. I've been here a couple of times due to proximity, but my favorite dish would have to be the Egg Scramble with Sausage, Gouda, and Onions! Just a callout: It usually comes with a salad instead of the Rosemary fries (per the menu)",1
2791,7,4,3/31/2013,"We went here for brunch this morning. I think there are maybe eight tables total, some elbow to elbow. The staff has to pull the table out for one person to sit on the bench. At 10:30 AM on a Sunday we had two groups of two ahead of us. The host said it would be 10 minutes, but it was 20+ before being seated. The eggs florentine were superb. The salad had a wonderful dressing and the whipped potatoes were pinkish in color, tomatoes maybe? The main dish though was superb as I wrote. Not too much hollandaise and the eggs were cooked just right. My wife had the apple pancakes with berry compote. She thought they were also some of the best she has had in NYC. The coffee was pretty good as well. Something about the host though. They don't take reservations, they don't have list to put your name, and they don't take cash. However, when anyone walked in the host asked in a off-way ""Can I help you?"" as if he meant to say ""Give me a break everyone. Just line up outside and leave me alone."" Hmm. Maybe just a bad morning for Easter Sunday. Hopefully his day gets better. And we are most certainly going back for brunch again.",1
2792,7,4,3/31/2013,"I struggled with the star rating. I came here for dinner with my friends for my last night in New York. Delicious as it was, the customer service was definitely lacking. I got the pasta, which was rich in flavor and it was out-of-my-mind delicious. Price/serving is similar to that you would find in a gourmet restaurant (this place is a small hole-in-the-wall cafe). My friends ordered other dishes so I was able to try the Rosemary fries. They were a bit salty, but still pretty good. Dinner is good - pricey but good. Customer service needs work. We made reservations at 6:30pm and came on time. However, he told us we still needed to wait - and to wait outside. My friend tried asking him for recommendations for her order, but she got cut off by the waiter walking away...THREE times. So, I want to say the food is 5 stars. But customer service is very important to me - for that, I give it a 2...but food's so good I'll settle with a 3.5ish/4ish.",1

You actually have to walk through the kitchen to get to the single bathroom in the establishment. NO reservations. Cash Only.",1

The menu is filled with fresh, savory choices and the service is always top notch and cheery despite the tiny size of their dining room.

Try the Nutella toast with fruit, the apple pancakes, and any of the scrambles. Cash only.",1
2795,7,2,3/22/2013,"We stopped in Nook for lunch earlier this week with a couple of friends. Â No problem getting a table on a weekday, but (as previous posts mentioned) it is small in there. Â My friends had really enjoyed breakfast/brunch at this spot before, but I found lunch to be.. lunch. We all ordered soup and sandwiches. Â The mushroom soup of the day was decent, but I thought the sandwiches were pretty skimpy. Â My chicken and avocado sandwich had maybe 1/3 of a chicken breast that had been thinly sliced and about 1/4 of an avocado- all on a piece of thick crusty bread. Â It tasted ok, but seemed really stingy and could have used a lot more volume. Â The rosemary fries were good. Drinks were odd. Â Each table was given a large bottle of water to serve ourselves. Â There was no ice and the water was room temperature. Â We ordered sodas and were presented with a glass and whatever was left of a can- still no ice. Â $3 for a can of soda, but we had to drink it warm... very European. Service was slow and gruff. Â CASH ONLY. Â So Nook was a disappointment. Â I'll try somewhere else next time!",1

Â Both the appetizers I tried, the mushroom cigar and the tuna tartare, were very good but far from the best I've had. Â My main course, a salmon dish, was good as well, and was peculiarly long- and slenderly-shaped, which in my opinion was a positive since it was easier to cut and eat.

Â Despite this, the ambiance was nice and intimate. The service was kind of bad. Â The waiter (owner too?) seemed annoyed that we didn't have reservations. Â It was also difficult to get his attention throughout our time there, despite the fact that there weren't many people there and the small size. Now onto the food. Â The mushroom cigars were really tasty, but a bit too oily and nothing special. Â The sashimi-peppered tuna was excellent in presentation. Â But I felt that it didn't taste as good as it looked.

Nothing too wow like most of the other brunch places I've been to are. The potato pancakes and sausage were pretty good. We also got the quiche. I think my biggest problem here in general is just the fact that everything was really salty. I was chugging water like no other.

The waiter had a thick Norwegian accent but was nice and attentive. My wife ordered the apple pancakes and loved it. It was unique, not simply pancakes with an apple topping. They were cooked in and dominated the flavor. I ordered the potato pancakes with salmon. Very light and refreshing. Good balance.

1817,7,3,2/19/2013,"Used to heading to the Upper West Side or one of the villages for brunch, I was super excited when my roommate discovered that there is brunch near our apartment. Eager to see if we had finally found our go-to brunch spot, we checked it out yesterday. Upon arriving, the first thing we noticed was that there is literally no place to stand while waiting to be seated. We awkwardly stood near the door behind the red curtain since the couple in front of us was already squeezed in the tiny space between the tables and curtains. Luckily for us, we only had a 10 minute wait, during which we also ran to the ATM next door to grab cash (cash only!). I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon and my roommate and I decided to indulge and share the Apple Pancakes. The Eggs Benedict was fairly standard though the biscuits were a bit too soggy. The mashed potatoes that came with the eggs were delicious! Not quite sure why it was slightly pink colored, but I could definitely eat more of it. The apple pancakes were fresh and pretty. Be careful not to pour too much of the strawberry jam on them though: the jam is tasty, but definitely overpowers the pancake. While Nook didn't blow my mind, the food was solid, the wait was short, and I'd come back.",1
2809,7,2,2/16/2013,"My friend and I went to Nook on a Saturday night for dinner. We liked that the atmosphere was cozy. We ordered the mushroom cigars and the beet salad. The mushroom cigars were only warm, not hot but the salad was good. For dinner we ordered the Tuscan chicken, their most popular dish, and the shrimp. Overall, both of our meals were very dry. The chicken was heavy because of the cream sauce but the mashed potatoes were dry. The seasoning on the shrimp was flavorful but it seemed as though the shrimp was over cooked. The shrimp came with vegetable couscous and sautÃ©ed spinach which were also very dry and bland. The wait staff (one man) was very friendly and attentive. Also, keep in mind this is a BYOB. I was incredibly turned off by the location of the bathroom, which is through the kitchen. I find it extremely unsanitary that the restaurant allows patrons to walk through their kitchen. Overall, this dining experience was mediocre and I probably wouldn't eat here again.",1

Getting in and out is a pain since someone has to keep manually closing the door to prevent the cold air from rushing in. If you can help it, stay away from being seated at the door! The server was very natural and real, well informed and quick to serve us. I liked the salmon eggs Benedict with hollandaise on the side. My friends ordered the veggie sandwich, the chocolate French toast and the French onion soup. The veggie sandwich was definitely not the best on the menu so you could def avoid that. Be prepared to wait, get polite service but also be cramped. I'm all in for such places; you gotta decide if you are!",1
2813,7,3,2/12/2013,"I debated between giving Nook 4 stars vs. 3. Â But I settled with three stars because while it is in a good location and the food is delicious, the service is shaky. Â Food-wise, I highly recommend the eggs benedict as well as the potato pancakes for brunch. The issues is how TINY this place is--so much so that it makes you really anxious especially with the host bearing down on you and yelling at you to wait outside. Â I've witnessed the host turn down large groups even when they offered to split up. Â I've also had a particularly bad experience the first time I was here where the waiter was rather rude. Â I asked for coffee with skim milk, and he scoffed, saying they do not carry skim milk, so I decided against getting coffee. Â In response, he asked if I was ""on a diet or something"" as if it is so bizarre to not want whole milk in your coffee. Â He basically argued with me for the next five minutes over MY decision to not drink coffee with whole milk.

The only downside for me is that the place is super small so you will likely have a few more people in your party in the form of guests at adjacent tables. That said, knowing this ahead of time makes it part of the experience.",1
2816,7,5,2/9/2013,"In brief: extremely cozy atmosphere, rich, comforting food, and surprisingly hospitable service. When in New York - one of the world's greatest food cities - each meal is a tedious choice for an out-of-towner. Preparing to dine in Hell's Kitchen before a show at Terminal 5, my girlfriend and I were overwhelmed by the possibilities. Fortunately, an old friend and New Yorker of three years didn't even think twice in recommending Nook. His initial highlight was it's BYOB policy, but he said that benefit paled to the quality of its' food. He raved about the filet mignon, which he said is an absolute steal by NYC standards. We left a message on the answering machine the next day, hoping against odds that we'd get a reservation day of. At 4:30, our hopes were answered, even though he could only squeeze us in a 5:00. As we arrived out of the bitter cold January afternoon, our waiter excitedly greeted us, as we were the first customers of the night. He finished up his confirmation calls, chatted us up, and opened our wine, all while maintaining an aura of ownership. We soon found out that he wasn't the owner after all, but might as well have been, as he'd worked there since nearly its opening some 8 years ago. His style could best be described as personable, but blunt. Reading other reviews, I could see how this could come off as potentially rude, especially in a busy environment. No matter, my girlfriend and I both agreed that his service was preferential to 99% of all other waiters - appropriately inquisitive, prompt, and extremely knowledgeable. On to the good stuff: the food. Coming off several priorly rich meals, I decided to order the Tuscan Chicken, rather than the Filet. My girlfriend, after much indecision, went with the Garden Pasta. We split the Country Salad to start. The salad was absolutely delectable, with a light, but flavorful vinaigrette. It was a perfect sampling of the quality to come and as it should have, left me craving another order. The Garden Pasta was cooked to perfection, all of the vegetables tasting fresh, and the parmesan sauce was rich and flavorful, but not overwhelming. With a background in food marketing, she noted that the Pasta was exactly what most company's wish their microwavable pasta meals tasted like. Initially this appeared to not be a compliment, but the sentiment was nevertheless high praise from her perspective. Lastly, touted as one of the most popular entrees, my Tuscan Chicken lived up to the hype and then some. The chicken was cooked to perfection, an ideal amount of ricotta was applied to each slice, and chive mashed potatoes complimented it all exquisitely, making me long for their inclusion at my family's annual Thanksgiving feast. We declined dessert in light of the upcoming show, but certainly not as a result of being overly full. Our waiter thanked us graciously for our business and even recommended a few watering holes for our next stop. We left more than satisfied with the experience and relieved that we didn't waste a precious New York meal.",1
2817,7,5,2/7/2013,"I last went to Nook about a year and a half ago, and had one of the best breakfasts out at a restaurant, pretty much ever. (I don't eat breakfast/brunch at restaurants that often because I am usually too ravenous and might maim someone if I leave the house without having coffee first! lol) Unfortunately I had forgotten the name of the restaurant (woops), but remembered it being so awesome that I decided to try to find it on Yelp (recently, when I was ruminating on awesome breakfasts lol. I wasn't Yelping too much then). I searched through EVERY restaurant in Midtown til I found it (and here I am!). Basically, Nook is a tiny little restaurant that serves really great food. The waiter (owner?) was so friendly and awesome. I remember getting some kind of french toast with fruit on it, and it was out of this world. They also have good iced coffee!

Like the 20,000 ""YUM, YUM"" Places I see cropping up. i liked Nook for it's neighborly feel and charm. It maybe a bit cramped inside and on weekends it can be quite a wait but if you find a table you'll get great service from the people who work there and some friendly conversation. The food as really great and the portions were big! The owner, who also serves"" is really great and friendly and always remembers what you drank last. The place is tiny but it adds to the charm and the friendly that you are a friend's house with 8 or 6 tables of your ""closest"" bffs instead of on a busy avenue.",1
2826,7,3,1/25/2013,"This place has amazing soups, and rosemary fries!!! I have been here a few times for lunch. The last unfortunately was the worse. Again food great, but this day. Freezing cold outside. Nook is Extraordinarily cozy (small). The door opens you will freeze, even though they have a curtain doing its best. This day for lunch deliveries came in, late so we were told. Making that nice warm restaurant very very cold. Not one delivery but 4 trips. And to boot my date had to keep getting up to hold the door Â for the delivery guys and pick up fallen products. We asked for more bread. We waited and waited, while he paid the driver in CASH. The topper, the owner never apologized, didn't even seem to care. Thought maybe he would knock off some money, or something. Nothing. He then said sorry I only take cash. (I'm betting because he had given away all of his register cash to the driver). Â Rude, and unapologetic.",1
2827,7,3,1/22/2013,"Came here on a long weekend for brunch. Sure 9th avenue has a abundance of places to eat but i liked nook for it's neighborly feel and charm. It maybe a bit cramped inside and on weekends it can be quite a wait but if you find a table you'll get great service from the people who work there and some friendly conversation. Straightforward menu of sandwiches, a soup of the day, egg dishes, including poached eggs. My friend loved the spinach and goat cheese eggs Benedict and it had a abundant amount of ingredients. I had the Apple pancakes and again it had a abundance of apples and a apple taste. Loved the tart strawberry and raspberry side sauce along with maple syrup. For my personal taste i thought the pancakes could of been a bit more fluffy and it seemed kind of doughy inside. We also had the mushroom soup which was full of flavor and ingredients but on a cold day the soup could of definitely been hotter. Great brunch. Super nice owner.",1
2828,7,4,1/22/2013,"Came here for brunch on a Sunday around 1:30pm and wait time was under 15 minutes. Waiting area is in the cold so make sure you're prepped for the weather. Inside the place was quite packed/tiny, maybe up to 8 tables (fit for up to 4 people) in all so go with a small group (ideally one other). You're 2 inches away from the next table. What wow-ed me was the brunch prices, perhaps the lowest I've seen in a while. $10 for eggs benedict, 10.50 for eggs florentine, 11.50 with salmon. What made it even more worth it was the quality of the meal. The dish came with this AMAZING mashed potato and salad. The egg could've been a little more runny but no complaints! They also didn't skimp out on the hollandaise sauce so I was happy. The belgium hot chocolate was typical but it came in a large mug so it was more than filling! Overall, really satisfied with the meal and didn't feel at all rushed. IMPORTANT- CASH ONLY (duane reade and bofa one block away)",1

But, we each brought a bottle of wine...which actually saved us a lot of $ on the check! I got the peppered tuna with avocado! Wow! It was DELICIOUS!! Fresh and flavorful. We had a lovely time! My only complaint is that we were rushed out of there by the server because the next reservation was waiting for our table. I guess it's hard to to be mad about it though...the place is so small that there is literally NO WHERE to wait if you're waiting on a table! I'd definitely go back!",1

We had an 8:30 reservation but the group before us arrived late and the restaurant had let them stay until they finished - so we got pushed back to 9:00, not too bad, we went to a bar near by and had some drinks there. We ordered a bunch of things, the Mushroom Cigars are so good!! I had the Chicken Kabobs which came with a side of rosemary fries and salad, delicious as well. Everyone else seemed to have enjoyed their food, between the sharing food and the wine we had, I honestly can't remember what everyone else ordered, but I enjoyed every bite I stole from their plates. Like everyone else says, this place is BYOB, which is excellent as each of the 9 of us brought a bottle of wine, and someone awesome had brought a bottle of Vodka. There was no cork fee, which is even more excellent, we ended up finishing all but one bottle, and it was not the vodka. We eneded up being the last table there, but the staff were accomodating and didnt rush us at all. The peanutbutter dessert... if you do not have a peanut allergy, you NEED to try it.",1

Â Here is the original: We were thrilled to find a BYO in Hells Kitchen so close to theatre district. Even more pleased to find the food was so good! Mushroom cigars, as others have mentioned, were divine and entrees were piping hot (a huge plus) and delicious. We were not sure after reading reviews how the service would be, but were pleasantly surprised that our server was attentive and food was prompt. We even observed a customer who dropped a fork, and the one waiter (covering the whole restaurant) jumped to bring her a new fork. Thank you Robert and Nook cooks! Our meal was great!",1

After telling me that there is a 15 min wait, the server asks me to get out of his way and wait outside.I walk out and I realize that he just LOCKED the door behind me. When I try to get back in, the couple sitting by the door unlocks the door for me. I am baffled when I see the server run over to the door and lock it back while staring at my face. Then he carries on by yelling at the couple for unlocking the door. Minutes later he brings the wrong order to the girl sitting next to me. He then fights with the cook claiming it was not gia foult and as he is getting physical, we cant help but lapigh because you can see and hear everything that goes on in the kitchen in the shoe box of a restaurant. When he gets to my table, he slams the water bottle where he seated me, the list bizzare incidences go on and on and on. Was it all worth the sashimi peppered salad I've ordered? Absolutely not...

Â I ordered the thai marinated rack of lamb, medium rare which is seared on the outside, pink just inside, and red in the middle. Â I never, ever send anything back in restaurants for myriads of reasons, but this lamb was so well done that it was gray throughout. Â I spoke to the waiter and he agreed to have the chef make another dish. Â The next dish came out rare looking like sashimi. Â Seared Ahi Tuna is cooked more than the lamb that was put in front of me, and they proceeded to charge me full price after 2 mishaps. Â  It was unfortunate as the restaurant itself has a good vibe and atmosphere, and it is a BYOB. Â If you choose to go, choose a different dish than I did.",1
2835,7,4,1/4/2013,"As the name suggests this restaurant is tiny but in a cute and intimate way. I love that it is BYOB, a rare treat to find in the city. We ordered the tuna tartar appetizer which was good but a pretty small portion. For my entree I ordered the chicken kebabs which were all around tasty. The mediterranean cucumber dill salad that it came with was awesome and the rosemary fries were equally as good. I did think the chicken was little dry though, my only complaint! Â My boyfriend and I left feeling satiated. They take reservations, I made one when I went and I'm glad I did as there were people waiting outside when we arrived.",1

2840,7,4,12/26/2012,"Nook is off the hook! I apologize for the lame play on words, but this place a great little find in Hell's Kitchen. I came here for my friend's birthday dinner, and expected a big fancy place, but it was a small and cozy restaurant that became very intimate with a group of people I just met. With the great BYOB with no corkage fee, each of us 6 girls brought in our own bottle of wine. The waiter was extremely friendly, probably because he kept on having to pass us each time because we were sitting at the table in the back right by the kitchen. It was very crowded, but what do you expect from a nice, trendy restaurant in Manhattan? Now for the food. We started off with complimentary bread, it was not out of the ordinary amazing, but it was decent bread. It could have been heated up a little to have that warming feeling because it was freezing outside, but the bread is just stacked in its baskets on the counter in the back. Appetizers - we got the mushroom cigars ($7.50), which were two pieces of flaky, thin dough that wrapped delicious mushrooms and other things that I could not tell because it was too dark. It came with a little portion of salad with balsamic that was a great touch to balance the savoriness of the mushroom cigars. Entrees - a few of us got separate dishes, and I got to taste a bit of everything Tuscan Chicken ($17) - I would rarely order chicken at a nice restaurant, because it is usually something that I regularly each at home or at the dining halls. But, this chicken was sliced up in pieces already and had a somewhat pesto sauce in the middle, and it was extremely tasty! I had a few bites from the person across from me, and two people ordered this and finished it completely! I definitely enjoyed this a bit more than what I ordered. Sashimi Peppered Tuna ($17) - yum yum! It is a bit random to have sushi type food at an American restaurant, but they made it amazingly. It was extremely tender and soft and slid down my throat so smoothly. (""That's what she said"") Thai-Marinated Grilled Rack of Lamb ($21) - I had a piece of the lamb from the birthday girl, but it was honestly not the best lamb that I have eaten. It was not that flavorful and a bit dry. I would recommend trying some of the other dishes unless you are really in the mood for lamb! Steak Frites ($21) - I ordered the Steak medium rare and it came with the famous rosemary fries. The fries were pretty normal, and I expected a lot more from all of the reviews on yelp. It was only slightly seasoned and it was good and crispy, but not that magnificent. The steak was very juicy and tender, and extremely flavorful. It was lot of meat to handle (sorry, I did it again), and I could not finish even half my steak and shared with everyone else on the table, but I did take bites of everyone else's food. This dish also came with a portion of salad with balsamic vinaigrette like the one from the mushroom cigars. It was a good diversified portion of meat, starch, and veggies. I would definitely come back again to Nook, especially because of the awesome BYOB!",1
2841,7,4,12/21/2012,"It's tight and it's yummy. No it's not what you think. Â I'm talking about this nice little neighborhood gem. Â BYOB is always a plus - but frankly I'm a fan of their delicious Sunday brunches. Â My lady ordered the omelette and I had the eggs benedict. Â Both were above average and definitely gave us plenty of reasons to come back. Â But keep in mind, the place is tiny and you'll be dining in close quarters. Â Also plan on a solid wait unless you get there on the earlier side, so definitely keep that in mind before you head out. Â  My only qualm was the so-so service. Â The wait staff was hard to find and people weren't exactly the most friendly. Â But then again, it's a tiny place with a tiny staff. Â With people waiting to be served or asking when their tables are ready, I can see why it's not easy to be exactly chipper at all times. Â  Nonetheless, if you're in Hell's Kitchen and you're looking for a good go-to brunch spot, definitely keep this place in mind. Â You won't be disappointed. Â Prices here are also reasonable relative to what you get, so that's another plus.",1
2842,7,4,12/12/2012,"came for sunday brunch. the name is fitting, literally just a little nook in the wall. tight space but yummy food. We got the eggs benedict with salmon. delicious. caveat: cash only, be prepared.",1
2843,7,4,12/11/2012,"Happy with the meal we had here. Â We're staying in midtown and wanted to try something close but less touristy. This was a solid choice. It's VERY small! I think maybe, at most, 15 people could fit in this room? There were only a few other people dining at the same time as us. I had the cheddar burger because I wanted some comfort food - great burger with delicious rosemary fries. Cash only - lunch for 2 with tip was 26.00",1
2844,7,4,12/11/2012,"I was tasked with finding a place to eat, outside of Times Square, and Nook did the trick. BYOB, no cork fee, and had solid reviews. You can't really deny those attributes. We had no reservations, like Anthony Bourdain, but we were able to squeeze in thanks to the nice group next to us for making room. Popped a few bottles and we were on for the evening. The gentlemen that served us was a veteran, you could just tell, and it was a pleasant dinner. Mushroom cigars to start, rack of lamb, chicken, and salmon for entrees. No complaints except for the salmon was a bit over done, I chalk that up to not ordering it a little under done, you eat raw salmon with sushi right?? The rack of lamb had an asian glaze, mashed potatoes, and greens that were surprisingly good despite the plate appeal. Price was right and the food was far above average. I considered myself lucky for finding this place. The restroom was in an interesting place. Through the kitchen, right past the chef on the grill, at the end, to your left. A place that lets you walk through the kitchen is a. very trusting of it guests b. confident in the cleanliness of their kitchen. I respect both. The mobile app delivered once again. If you are staying in tourist land NYC or North of there I suggest checking stopping here. Make reservations! Three of us came in on a Tuesday evening and nearly every seat was occupied or reserved.",1
2845,7,5,12/3/2012,"Americans like to be coddled, pet on the head and told we're wonderful. I should know, I am one, and I appreciate all of those things in my dining experience...most of the time. You can't blame me, I'm of the ""entitled generation."" So, if you're looking for obsequious, over the top customer service, this place just isn't for you. One reviewer even gave a one-star rating based on this, which is unfortunate. Is the owner gruff and not the friendliest? Sure, I'd say he's as warm as a grizzly bear after he's eaten (better than before a meal, eh?). Is the place the size of my pathetic studio? Probably smaller and that's saying a lot. Is, however, the food tasty and satisfying? Phenomenally priced? Yes! Yes! And best of all, is this a BYOB, with no corkage fee? YES! So if you don't mind getting your ass ever-so-slightly handed to you (depending on the owner's mood), and if you appreciate some Euro-disco-pop tunes while you eat the most delicious mushroom cigars of your life, GO HERE. Nook is awesome!!",1

We came without a reservation, but they were able to fit us in just in the nick of time..the people who came after were turned away. I wasn't that hungry, so had the salad provencal. Mediocre..wish I got actual food. Dining partners had the pan seared salmon and chicken, both of which were cooked very well. Group consensus the entrees were pretty good, including the chive mashed potatoes. Definitely a bright spot in the otherwise culinary cesspool that is Hell's Kitchen.",1
2846,7,3,11/28/2012,"To be honest, the only reason why we stumbled on this place was because we were too lazy and it was too cold to wait on the Totto line. (Don't judge! A hot bowl of ramen is comforting on a cold night, alright!) The bf and I neglected to read the reviews about the restaurant being BYOB, darn. It's a very small, cozy restaurant, with maybe around eight tables or so. It was a random Wednesday night at around 9:30pm and there were only two other parties dining concurrently. He ordered the thai marinated rack of lamb and I ordered the spinach and feta stuffed chicken, with a side of rosemary fries and mushroom cigars as an appetizer. Loved the mushroom, although it only came with two ""cigars"". Fresh and overwhelmingly mushroomy, yum! When our entrees came, I was a little disappointed with mine because the chicken was dry. Maybe it was my fault, I was initially eying the steak but I just don't appreciate moisture-less chicken. His lamb was good--the sauce that coated the meat was tasty and tangy. The fries were alright, with a small hint of rosemary in every chew. Waiter was nice as well but we most likely wouldn't be back because the entrees didn't really wowed us. A 3.5 star if I could.",1
2847,7,3,11/18/2012,"Came in solo on a Sunday afternoon, solely due to yelp. Waited outside for 15 minutes, the time quoted by the manager/owner, and was sat at the table that's literally right inside the door. Bit chilly because people would keep forgetting to shut the door when they came in. Ordered a sausage and gouda scramble with a whipped potato thing and light salad on the side. Also ordered a mochaccino and they brought me a cappuccino. Still tasty and didn't complain about it. The food was very a-ok. Fine enough, but nothing much above average. Maybe I had the wrong thing. Also must have missed the sign that said cash only, as I didn't bring any. But the manager dude was very accommodating in letting me go find an ATM without leaving my bag or drivers license. Really wanted to like this place more, given the goodwill of the people there, but the food wasn't worth 4 stars.",1
2848,7,1,11/18/2012,"If I could give this place zero stars I would. Please note that this is not my first time at this restaurant. To be fair, the food here is amazing and I would have probably given it a four-star rating, but I am never going to come back to this place again. I really do not care who the European man was, owner or not, your job is to provide service and yelling at your customers because we were asking for the wait time is not right. Very soon also does not equal a 40-minute wait. Please get a watch and learn how to read time. I do not care how good the food is, but this was completely unacceptable behavior and ruined the entire mood for our party.",1
2849,7,4,11/18/2012,The place is a homey hole in the wall shop.the food was very good and moderately priced. It's good if you are in a hurry because the food comes out fast. The only negative is its a cash only place so make sure you visit an ATM before coming.,1
2850,7,4,11/17/2012,"Had a nice late brunch today and was able to sample a number of items. There's a lot of good about this place and would highly recommend it for a weekend morning visit. The menu items I ate (and sampled) include Apple Pancakes, Cauliflower Soup, Eggs Benedict w/ smoked salmon, and Eggs Florentine w/ smoked salmon. The food was great. The apple pancakes for example had a ""home cooked"" feel because of their less than perfectly round shape and texture. It was paired with a fruit based (I believe raspberry) syrup which offered a nice contract. Also great was the cauliflower soup. It was savory and creamy and had the right amount of salt and flavor. As for the others, while they were good, they were not particularly special and so enjoyed the food. Another positive aspect is that the place is (slightly) cheaper than other comparable brunch locations in the area. The biggest drawback I have was that the place does not yet have a liquor license and does not serve any alcoholic beverages. Which means no mimosa or bellinis with morning brunch. Being that I'm not an alcoholic, I didn't mind terribly but still would have preferred the option. Also a small drawback was the tight packed seating . Granted the place was called ""nook"" but the establishment was still trying to squeeze as many people as possible in a tiny ""nook"". But overall, minor details aside, enjoyed brunch and will likely come again.",1
2851,7,4,11/15/2012,"went here last night before a show. Â BYOB is big plus. Â very small, definitely call ahead.

Nook has a very simple atmosphere and is quite relaxing. We had the mushroom cigars and the tuna tartare. Â The mushroom cigars were very good with light pastry shell. Â The tuna tartar was excellent. Â Both appetizers were big enough to share. We each got the Thai marinated lamb chops which was a substantial meal with three lamb chops, mashed potatoes and cabbage.

2854,7,3,11/10/2012,"This review is for dinner, which is something that not many yelp-ers seem to come here for. My man took me here for my birthday, and we had a very nice dinner. We shared a raw tuna appetizer, he got a steak and i got the thai lambchops. I lOVED the lambchops, just wished there were more than 3 tiny ones. His steak was good too. We brought a bottle of prosecco and drank that during the meal. I think we got the peanutbutter pie for dessert which was also good. All in all, an A-OK meal. My issues which lead to 3 and not 4 stars- we had a rez which we were early for. The place in TINY (like 7 tables) and all tables were full when we got there. A 4-top left just after we checked in, and there was another group waiting (without a rez, I believe), and the host gave the 4-top to the other party, even though we had a rez. So we ended up waiting another 30 min for a table, which sucked and we were starving. Also, the bread basket didn't have a liner (napkin or paper) which is weird and unsanitary, just your bread in a dirty basket. Server was nice, but no one acknowledged my bday or gave us a complimentary anything which would've soothed our inflamed tempers over the whole waiting debacle. I would eat there again if in the neighborhood but wouldn't go out of my way.",1

I made a reservation far in advance for a group of 11 people for a birthday dinner, and called 4 times to confirm, including that day- they said it would be cramped but they'd manage. We bought tons of wine and were all excited, but when our group arrived we were told there was no reservation for that night. They said they were overbooked and there was nothing they could do.. and zero apologies for the mistake. So we had to find a restaurant that could accommodate a group of 11 on a Saturday night at 8:30... But luckily we found an Indian restaurant a block down that was also byob- new Bombay- maybe it wasn't the most incredible culinary experience, but go there next time if you want a fun byob with management that is competent and actually cares about its customers!",1

Â You'll see someone leave and he'll walk outside and point to whomever is next and bring them in. Â  The space is pretty cramped, but that is sometimes to be expected in NYC. Â I got the sausage, gouda and onions scramble. Â It was really good. Â great sausage and a good amount of gouda. Â My friend got the eggs benedict but felt it didn't have enough hollindaise sauce.

I ordered the lamp chops with cabbage and mashed potatoes. The lamb was cooked perfectly and uniquely seasoned! I didn't care for the cabbage -- too sweet for my taste.

Â Its a very small place. We went by the reviews of fellow yelpers but were a but disappointed. The Eggs Benedict was ok, nothing out of the world. My wife ordered Potato Pancake with sausage. Although it was greasy I liked the pancake though not the sausage. Our coffe was just ok. Would prefer Starbucks any day over this coffee. Our Cafe Au Lait and Moccachino was below average. Cafe Au Lait was not not even hot. Overall this place did not live up to its hype. Its an inexpensive cash only place but not worth a long wait. I have had better brunches in the city.",1
2866,7,4,10/7/2012,"What a delicious brunch. Â This place is super tiny so the wait (especially for a party larger than 4) was super long, but worth it. Â They have great coffee and espresso drinks and the vegetable quiche was amazing-- balanced flavor, buttery crust, and served with a simple green salad. Â Our 2 male companions ordered burgers for brunch and although I didn't sample those they both finished them so they must have been good. Â Let's talk about the fries though. Â Crispy rosemary infused fries. Â Unbelievable. Â I want to eat them with every meal. Â We finished brunch with a slice of the much raved about peanut butter pie with 5 spoons. Â Even if you don't think you have room you should order it. Â Trust me. I'd definitely come back here again-- a really delicious and non-pretentious brunch. Â Just how I like it. Â Remember that it's cash only and BYOB (in case you'd like a mimosa)!",1
2867,7,5,9/29/2012,"My girlfriends and I had our last dinner here and it was quite a nice and memorable experience. We dined here in September 2011. I found this place thanks to Yelp and wanted to find a place that provided cheap corkage. Well how cheaper can it get when they do it for free? Yes, this restaurant is a BYOB. The ladies started a tradition. We live in different areas of the United States and this reunion came to a bitter sweet ending. So the tradition ... we share a bottle of wine together and write a note on the cork. It was quite a tear jerker. Now let's delve into the A.S.S. (Atmosphere, Service, and Skills) of this restaurant. I called to book a reservation for four. The place was told to be really tiny by all the reviews I read. They happily obliged and we came about 2 hours later ready to eat and to be merry. Then to be sad ... since it was bittersweet. Boy, this place is tiny. They had our table ready within a few minutes. They chilled our wine and handed us a menu, I decided to treat the ladies to appetizers and dessert (they are all on teacher's salary). We had the mushroom cigars, they were very flavorful. The earthiness of the mushrooms and the lightness of the pastry worked very well together. They pour our wines for us and keep our glasses full. For the main entree I ordered a rack of lamb. It was perfectly cooked and tender. The sauce complimented the meat but didn't over power the flavor the lamb. I loved it and ate to the bone. For dessert, I don't recall exactly what we ordered (my first review had it stated, but I have since deleted that account). However, I remembered our reactions. We enjoyed it. While the Nook is tiny, the atmosphere provided a nice and cozy respite from the hustle and bustle of Hell's Kitchen. It was simple and understated, no frills. However I enjoyed the simplicity, it let you focus on the food. The wait staff was friendly and not too overbearing, just the right amount of attention. My friends and I did not feel rushed. They gave us room to be able to enjoy our conversation without sacrificing attentive service. However, at the time, it was cash only. Thank goodness we were forewarned.",1
2868,7,4,9/18/2012,"Really cute BYOB, great food.. maybe the best burger and fries i've had in a long time (flavored very nicely), and the food the rest of my party got looked delicious too. Â We went for dinner on a Friday night and had no trouble getting seated with our reservation. Â The only reason I'm giving it a 4 is because it's cash only, and I rarely carry cash with me, but otherwise, would definitely recommend this place!",1

2870,7,5,9/10/2012,My friend and I had an absolutely perfect lunch here. Â We went around 3:30pm on a Saturday and were the only people there after the brunch rush. Â My friend got the seared tuna salad and I had the smoked salmon sandwich. Â We both LOVED our meals. Â My sandwich had a ton of fresh dill on it and lots of capers. Â It was so good and really light. Â Our waiter was very friendly and accommodating. Â It was so hot and muggy outside but when we sat down he suggested the coolest table near the fan and then closed all the doors and turned up the AC to make us comfortable. Â I work just a few blocks away and will definitely return soon for lunch!,1
2871,7,5,9/6/2012,"What a delicious brunch on Labor Day! We were starving and scouring Yelp to find an acceptable establishment. This place fit the bill. It is tiny and only seats about 19 people but the food is quality. It's delicious comfort food. We ordered their eggs florentine which comes with a savory mashed potato side. Not bad. Their French toast is to die for with a cinnamon crust, powdered sugar, and a tart but yummy strawberry sauce. We were full beyond belief after sharing both items. Hope to return again. Prepare yourself for possible sarcasm though. I called before making the trek there to ask if they were serving brunch and the guy, who ended up being our server, answered with a snicker and said, ""What do you think? Do you hear the background?"" Â I said ""ok just checking since it was a holiday"". He laughed again and said ""See ya when ya get here"". It kind of irked me but I figured what the heck. Turned out he was really nice, though sarcastic, and we had an enjoyable time.",1

Two might not sound like a big number, but this place only holds about 10 parties at max. In other words, this place is TINY, so get there early to grab a table. I got the egg scrambles with ham, cheese and mushrooms. I cleaned up my plate with the FRESH Sullivan St. Bakery bread they serve. It was delicious. Their service was okay; I only noticed one server catering to the entire restaurant. TIP: CASH ONLY.",1

Â Tables are moved so you can get to the bench, then you are wedged in, trapped 12"" from two other parties all trying to have a conversation. Â The space becomes very loud quickly. Â The Rosemary French fries had an interesting flavor but were limp and lackluster. Â The French Toast also lacked the outside crispiness I like in a well-cooked french toast. Â The French Toast itself had no flavor, and the strawberry compote, although good, wasn't up to the task of saving this dish. Â You fought the good fight Strawberry Compote, I applaud your efforts.",1
2877,7,4,7/29/2012,A charming find in midtown for brunch! All their egg scrambles are amazing. I especially love the smoked salmon one or the ham one. Mmm. The prices are too good to be true. Wait time can be pretty long for brunch so go either early or late.,1
2878,7,3,7/17/2012,"Very generic brunch fare in very cramped quarters. Cash only as well. I went here with a friend who was in town for a Saturday brunch at 11 AM. I walked in and asked for a table for two. Apparently, the host remembers the order people come because he didn't even ask for my name, just told me to wait outside. Nevertheless, 20 minutes later, we got our table. Man, is it cramped inside. A nook indeed, the tables are close together and I'm almost elbow to elbow with the person next to me. At least the host was nice enough to pull the table out for us. I got the eggs florentine with smoked salmon ($11.50), while my friend go the apple pancakes. Both were simple, but executed well. The food met my expectations for typical brunch fare. It's a good deal for a decent brunch in Hell's Kitchen, but the crowded space and so-so service make me want to try other places in NYC before coming back here. 3/5 stars.",1
2879,7,5,7/9/2012,"I went to Nook tonight and loved it!!! It is is BYOB, with no corking charge, which is always a good thing. I highly recommend the Mushroom Cigars and Thai Marinated Lamb. They were both absolutely delicious. The server, while obviously very busy (only one person does everything), was very helpful and efficient. We didn't have a reservation, but were lucky enough to get a seat tonight. I can't wait to go back for brunch!!",1
1891,7,1,7/8/2012,"Who is that rude lady in the front taking orders, rolling her eyes, being very condescending? Are you the owner? If yes, you should know better! If you aren't, then you need therapy. Cuz really lady you put a damper on our meal as soon as you came to the table. Blah! Your explanation of potato pancakes was clear and very condescending (I asked my friends if I was reading you wrong but they agreed with me...and now I see from the other yelpers that this is a trend). Â What appeared on my plate looked a hot mess. The only thing that was fresh was the salmon maybe??? Or maybe that was the lesser of the many evils. The potato patty was grey!!! Those patties were not fresh! Were they thawed from the freezer? Yuk! The batter could also be fresher. It looked like it was fried before and then refried/microwaved just before putting the salmon and capers on top. That's a disgrace. In NYC that is not acceptable. How hard is it to get fresh potatoes and fresh batter and fry it to order???? Really? How do you stay in business with such bad food and bad service? Maybe we all think 'oh it a cute nook lets give it a try'. People, the nook may look cute and intimate but it's def not worth your money.",1
2880,7,1,7/8/2012,"Walked in today for brunch, and caught the hostess's eye. I politely said ""two please"" and she snapped back, ""Yeah. I'll be outside in a sec"" while she rolled her eyes. Sorry I didn't know that we weren't allowed in the restaurant until you found time in your schedule to come out to the sidewalk to greet us. We left and went somewhere else where the hostess wasn't on the towel.",1
2881,7,3,7/7/2012,"I liked Nook the first time I went there, and tonight was the second time. The food is good and the Iced Belgian Hot Chocolate is TO DIE FOR. Now the weirdness: I made a reservation, so of course I gave my name. The guy who was running the show tonight decided to address me like he knew me all night. That's fine, but it felt kind of odd to be addressed whenever he came to the table. ""Hi Carly, do you want some more water, Carly? Hey Carly, how's your food, Carly?"" like... it's friendly.... but... I don't know you!! Then, towards the end, my friend had just been served his coffee and the waiter asked if we wouldn't mind leaving, because he needed the table. What was awkward was after he asked us to leave, he said ""Or.... you don't have to.... but we need the table. It's up to you."" Like... great- now I'm going to feel like if I stay, I'm delaying people, and if I leave, I feel rushed. It's not like we were going to stay all night., but like probably 10 more minutes to finish the coffee and wrap it up. It was passive and strange. Plus there was a table of six guys paying the bill right next to us, so either way, within the next five minutes, seats were going to be available. Finally, he brought us the bill and it was wrong. Then he brought us the right bill, missing the cappucino on it....that he'd accidentally added to the wrong bill. Food/drink great cute place I'll be back for a third time.... It was just kind of awkward.....",1
2882,7,1,7/7/2012,"GO ELSEWHERE. I really wanted to like Nook because its close by and relatively inexpensive. I have been there twice, once for dinner and once for lunch, and left utterly disappointed and angry both times. First of all- the service is disgusting. There is only 1 waiter or waitress for the restaurant, and both of them are rude and inconsiderate. If the waitress is there forget about bringing beer or wine to dinner, as she will complain to the staff in the kitchen (which is 5 feet away) and mock you behind your back. The waiter, an older man, won't even bring you change and will just assume you meant to leave a 30% tip. He will also scoff if you try to adjust an aspect of the menu to suite your preferences. The food also sucks. They have a soup Nazi in the back whipping up dishes that you could make at home. Avoid the steak, ""mushroom cigars"", and even the salad is bad. Bottom Line- There are too many restaurants in the area to try this place. The food is mediocre at best, the service is absolutely awful, and the restaurant (especially in the summer) is unbearably hot, especially with a kitchen so close to you.",1

966,7,3,7/7/2012,"Came back here for a 2nd meal and ended up not being that impressed anymore. Â Had the lamb this time which was good, but almost a little too sweet. Â Had the mushroom appetizers again and they were just okay. Â I wonder what happened here, but it was a bit of a disappointment after I had made it a point to go back. Â Still BYOB which is always good, but now I think this place is just okay.",1
2884,7,1,7/5/2012,"I used to like this place, but the staff's attitude is a big turnoff. Food is mediocre at best, and they are known for yelling at customers and causing problems. For example- I was waiting outside the restaurant on their bench while waiting for a friend. The cook came out with one of the other employees and demanded that I get off the chair because ""it wasn't for the public."" I moved over, and the second employee said he wanted to sit. Then the cook screamed at me and told me to leave. Canceled dinner plans so the cook could smoke in front of the restaurant.",1
2885,7,4,7/3/2012,"Nook is a nice little gem tucked away on the corner of 9th and 51st. It's cozy (~20 seats), casual, and open to the street making it a nice choice for a spring/summer brunch. It's not as popular as the big name places like Penelope nor does it have such an extensive menu, but what it does serve is served well. The smoked salmon eggs benedict, potato pancakes with sausage, and mushroom cigars are simple but fantastic picks. Brunch here won't break the bank either with prices running around $10/entree. If you're looking for a quaint, uncrowded, and simple Sunday brunch, give Nook a try. I'll be back here soon to try the dinner offerings. *This place is cash only",1
2886,7,3,7/1/2012,"Came here for brunch on a hot summer day. Cute little spot. But don't be fooled by the device over the front door - it's not an AC, just a fan. Thus, whatever weather it is outside, expect the same inside. The food gets the job done (yes, it was eggs benedict), but there's nothing special about it. I know it was a hot day, but even my salad looked as wilted as I felt sitting in the heat. After this visit, which was my third, I've decided I could get better brunch elsewhere in the neighborhood for about the same price. And where I can sit in the cool comfort of AC and move my elbows without punching someone in the boob.",1
2887,7,2,6/19/2012,"I was surprised by all the positive reviews Nook got. It's an interesting and yes, tiny, place but the food just wasn't good. Pros: On a Sunday at 3pm, my boyfriend and I did not have to wait longer than a few minutes for a table (but it was just the two of us). Service was fast. Waitress (or owner?) was very friendly and smiley, especially by NYC standards. Although the hash browns were really mashed potatoes, they were tasty. Cons: Ordered the eggs benedict, and it was extremely bland. Egg, hollandaise, ham, and English muffin--all of these flavorful ingredients completely without flavor. It was odd. I won't return. Many better places for brunch in NYC.",1
2888,7,4,6/13/2012,You can bring your own wine. The mushroom cigars are ridiculously good. The goulash is gorgeous. The tuna and avocado is melt in your mouth. The waiter is a jovial old chap. And you will miss it if you walk right by. Find this place. It's worth it,1

It is indeed quite small, but the food itself was quite good. I had the eggs benedict with salmon, which was very good for a very standard dish. Not sure if I would endure the wait for such a meal again, but if I had space for an early brunch and had a bottle of wine ready to crack open for such an occasion, I would definitely consider making plans for it.",1

Appetizer: mushroom cigars is yummy. 7. Spicy Citrus Marinated Shrimp - 4 stars (light and tasty) 8.

2891,7,3,6/7/2012,"I had a friend coming from out of town and wanted me to suggest a place to have dinner in Hell's Kitchen area. I don't know too much about the area (other than the awesome gay bars/clubs!) but remembered hearing about Nook from a past coworker. We had 5 people so I quickly called to make reservations. It was a wednesday night but who knows in New York what could get filled up! I called about 30 min before we were going to arrive and the lovely hostess said she could squeeze us in! When my friend and I got there (on time) the rest of our party had not arrived and the hostess looked slightly nervous that our party would diminish ... but eventually they came! This place is CASH only and BYOB! When we found out about the BYOB, i ran over to a liquor store nearby and bought two bottles of wine. It's pretty great for when you're on a budget! Turns out the only hostess is the server as well, which is okay with how small the restaurant is. We quickly ordered our appetizers and entrees when the rest of our party got here and the appetizers arrived very quickly. The mushroom cigars were absolutely mouth watering. Everything melted together in my mouth and I wanted more more more! The tuna tatare was also seasoned very well, although the avocado (guacamole?) spread on top was a bit sweet for my own taste. The entrees took a very, very long time to come out. It seemed like we were the last of a huge bunch of tables to put in their entree orders for a very small (one chef? that I could see at least) kitchen. When they finally came out, we all dug in with frevor!! I ordered the salmon over mashed potatoes and asparagus, my friends the filet mignon, shrimp, and tuscan chicken. We had a great selection of food on the table and all sampled each other's foods. The entrees were all very good, nothing AMAZING to write about but the food definitely filled us up with a very great feeling (might have been the 2 bottles of wine too...) Good restaurant, very reasonable prices and good food, but not somewhere I would rush to come back immediately.",1

I couldn't even find the cranny...Har har. ::slaps self for stupid joke:: I have to honestly say that I was a bit disappointed by this place even with all the great reviews. The service was decent, but the place was SO small that we essentially had the waiter standing above us the entire time. It made for a bit of a creepy, claustrophobic vibe, even though it wasn't by choice of the waiter. Even if I could get over the fact that I had to literally climb over the other patrons to get to my seat, I have to say that the food was not that impressive either. Our food was good but the rosemary fries were SO SALTY that I couldn't finish my food. I had to literally down three or four glasses of water in order to continue on. It seems like a pretty cute place, but maybe we went on an off day. I'd like to try dinner here sometime to see if our brunch experience was a fluke -- I'm hoping it was and will update when we have a chance to try dinner here. Seems like it would be a really nice place to have a casual dinner...but i really hope they keep the sodium at bay...",1

You only get seated when you get everyone arrive at the restaurant, so you might loss your table and ended up waiting for 30 mins when one of your friends runs 3 mins late. I have been trying to come here for month and month, but the waiting time was just terribly long, so I always ended up going to other places in the area. But I was really lucky this time that I pass by here at 1pm on a beautiful Saturday afternoon with my brother and there was no queue. My hubby was on his way to meet us and there were another 2 group of people were also waiting for one last person to join them, so we were all waiting for the only available table. It was very stressful. We ordered: scramble eggs, apple pancake, french toast and sear tuna salad. They were all delicious, I especially like the smash potato that came with the eggs. Apart from the potential queuing time, it is perfect for brunch.",1

Initially we wanted to come to Nook because we saw breakfast photos on yelp, but when we arrived, they were only serving lunch. I ordered the parisian ham sandwich lunch special which consisted of half of a sandwich, soup of the day, and a choice of salad or fries. The sandwich was delicious. It was comprised of ham, apples, and dijon mustard. The soup was my favorite. I'm not quite sure what it was, but it had cauliflower in it. The salad dressing on the salad was also very good.

Mashed potatoes-meh Ahi tuna- very good paired with avocado & nice salad, not filling enough though The peanut butter cake was pretty freaking delicious. I wasn't a huge fan of the raspberry layer ontop, but managed to scrape it off This place is definitely cramped. Tables must be moved to sit in your seat. There IS a bathroom...in the kitchen.

Based on previous Yelp reviews, I went for a Â Sunday Brunch and tried the Eggs Benedict dish which is definitely 5 star worthy when factoring price, service, and quality. Â  Just remember these 3 things when planning a trip to Nook: 1) BYOB: Yes, its great and convenient since Liquor stores are nearby. There's not many BYOB restaurants in the HK area, so its easier for Nook to stand out. Just don't expect to finish an entire bottle of wine there. Nook is small with very few seats, the food is rapidly served and the staff know how to get the tables turned over fast. 2) Cash Only: Prices are reasonable but no credit cards are accepted. 3) Seating: You'll likely be rubbing elbows with others while you eat. Hey it's NYC and the best restaurants all have their quirks. Lower your highbrow dining expectations, enjoy the ambiance and you'll soon you'll be a Nook regular.",1
2901,7,5,5/3/2012,"WOW. Â  I've lived in HK for 8 months, and I've been to the best and worst of its restaurants. Â This is among the best, if not THE best dinner I've had in the neighborhood. Â My only regret is that I did not go sooner. I think a lot of people have the perception that this is a brunch spot. Â I know I did. Â The line out the door every Saturday/Sunday morning led me to believe this, so I always avoided dinner and hoped for that one fateful day I'd get lucky and be able to waltz into brunch without waiting. Â Well, that's never going to happen, but that was how my dinner experience went down, and I couldn't be happier. Thing to note: Cheap: it's cash only and BYOB, which keeps costs down. Â I had all three of the below items for around $50. Â Just go in there with a bottle and a modest wad of cash and you're golden. Tuna Tartare: this was such a treat. Â It comes out nicely presented with a generous layer of avocado on the top, drizzled with, what I think, was aged balsamic. Â It melts in your mouth and explodes with flavor (that's what she said?). Â It's so delicate, you could drop a plastic fork into it and the prongs would still hit the plate. Â Get it. Steak Frites: looks more like a filet. Â It's a nice, thick cut of meat with a great balsamic reduction sauce on top. Â It comes with a pile of rosemary fries and a mixed green salad that had a light wasabi dressing. Â So good. Goulash: a different take on the traditional dish given that it has egg noodles, but so tasty. Â The chunks of meat dissolved on top of the noodles and create such a rich flavor. Â Definitely recommend it to all Central/Eastern European food lovers. It's a tiny operation: one waitress, a chef, and kitchen/dining room helper. Â Service is still great, and that just adds to the experience. Â Just remember it's called Nook for a reason, so you will be sitting next to someone you don't know. Â I'd also recommend limiting your party to two people. Â Four might be okay, but you'd likely have to wait.",1
2902,7,4,5/2/2012,I have been to Nook twice in the past year. The food is AMAZING! The place is a really cute inside. Nice and cozy. I have to recommend the mushroom cigars as an app. One of the great things is that is is BYOB. There is a wine store around the corner on 8th ave. My only qualm about the place was that the waiter was kind of rude. He was really snotty when we were inquiring about the menu while ordering. He also seemed to want to rush us out. That aside the food is great! I cannot wait to try their brunch!,1
2903,7,1,4/29/2012,What happened? Service today was horrible. I'm a pretty quick eater but was rushed beyond belief. Â What happened to the old Nook?,1
2904,7,4,4/28/2012,"Came here pre-theatre based on the rave reviews on Yelp. Â  A great little BYOB (Yay!), cash only spot with delicious food. Â The mushroom cigars were so delicious we ordered them twice. Â We had the citrus shrimp with couscous, country salad, and the chicken kabob with fries. Â Food was fresh and light, but portions were on the small side (we were splitting it among 3 people). Â Service was fast and friendly! Â  Definitely a nice spot to grab a quick bite before the theatre. Â (Go see Death of a Salesman---PSH is amazing!).",1
2905,7,1,4/27/2012,"I have never been more moved to write a review than I am for this place. While the food was decent, I was appalled by the service I experienced here with my friend and will make sure never to return here. My salad was fine and it came according to my request. The complimentary bread was fine as well. But the service from the moment we sat down was abysmal. Our server (presumably the owner or manager as well - even more atrocious that he takes such little pride in serving his customers) without a fleck of irony accused my friend of asking too many questions regarding the menu. She is not picky but was wondering about dairy in some of the items. He laughed in her face when she asked if they carry any dairy alternatives. He seemed annoyed that anyone could want any menu item even slightly altered to fit a dietary need. His overall manner was snobbish and rude throughout our whole time there, but the icing on the cake was the delivery of the check, when I placed down my card and he literally WAGGED HIS FINGER at me as he walked away and barked ""cash only"" over his shoulder. I don't mind paying cash only, but when I'm treated like an idiot, his ""cash only"" infuriated me even further. Finally, when I went to give him the cash, I said ""from the moment we walked in here, our service has been atrocious"", and he countered with ""well, I hope to never see you here again"". I said ""you can count on neither me nor any of my friends ever coming here again"". He hollered something bitter at us on our way out, in front of his other customers. Did not ONCE even try to rectify the situation. Both my friend and I have worked in the restaurant industry and have never seen such appalling service. What a disappointment from a place I really wanted to like since I heard the food was good. The best food in the world wouldn't make me go back. I forgot to mention. The restaurant was empty (save for 2 people) when we arrived, in a place that seats about 20. It was a freezing cold day, and a woman arrived earlier than the rest of the party she was meeting, and this same server made her wait outside in the cold, not even inside the almost empty restaurant. My friend and I just stared with our jaws dropped. She asked if she could even just stand inside the door because it was so cold and he treated her like she was a total idiot. Learn some gentlemanly manners, my friend.",1
2906,7,3,4/22/2012,"Cute atmosphere. Ok brunch. The eggs Benedict were ok, mashed potatoes good, but I found the food here to be super salty. You are going to wait, as the place is tiny, but it goes pretty quick.",1
2907,7,4,4/21/2012,"First off...BYOB!! Nook is a great find...everything here is first rate from Ramon greeting you and waiting on you as welll, to the small but very well versed menu. I had the citrus marinated spicy shrimp and my girlfriend had a filet... We shared an order of rosemary fries that were AMAZING!! You could actually taste the rosemary in the fries not just some greens sprinkled on top... The shrimp were juicy and tender not spicy at all and the couscous and spinach were a great healthy addition. Nook I will be back to tackle your brunch and most importantly.....dessert! FYI nook is tiny!!! Make reservations and be prepared to get real comfy with your neighbors ;)",1
2908,7,1,4/19/2012,"The service was extremely poor--the ""waitress"" was aggressive and rude.",1
2909,7,3,4/15/2012,"If Nook didn't receive such high ratings on Yelp, I probably wouldn't have even noticed or considered visiting this hole in the wall restaurant. With such rave reviews my friend and I decided to dine here for brunch and the restaurant certainly had an intimate setting as it seems it can only seat about a maximum of 20 people. Although the restaurant was decent, I wouldn't recommend dining here for dinner as it seems like it's only popular during brunch time. Unsurprisingly, there was already a wait when we arrived at noon. Despite the crowd, the owner did not take any names down and instead he called people based on who he believed arrived first. Regardless of his system, our wait was only about 15 min. I ended up ordering their tuna sashimi salad and although it was good, it was definitely not amazing. Let's just say it's a dish that I can easily mimic at home and the $14 price tag that came along with this dish was surely not worth it. Their tuna was minimal and their avocado was petite. However their dressing was yummy, with a nice Dijon kick and sweetness. All in all, the highlight and most attractive part about this restaurant is their BYOB with no cork fee. Secondly, I also liked the idea of passing by their kitchen to use the bathroom because I got to see what was going on behind the scenes. _________________________ **This is a Cash Only restaurant and they do not take reservation**",1
2910,7,5,4/15/2012,Wow! Â We found this place by accident and it was well worth the trip across town! Â The food was exceptional. (Apps - Mushroom Cigars and Cauliflower Soup were favorites/ Entrees - double cut pork chop special and filet mignon were favorites). We even gorged ourselves by sharing 3 different desserts. All were great but the peanut butter pie was to die for! It's BYOB so we brought a couple bottles of beautiful wine to enjoy. The waiter (Ramon) was very fun and friendly. He was proud to work there and it was obvious. Thanks for a great meal!,1
2911,7,4,4/14/2012,"We found Nook via Yelp reviews since we were looking for a place to grab dinner before seeing a show. Called there early afternoon to make an early dinner reservation, left a message and never heard back so we called again and they were very accommodating. Â Wonderful experience. Â Had the mushroom cigars to start. Absolutely delicious, really flavorful. Then each of us had different entrees. Chicken kabob, salmon, burger, and then salad/tuna tartar. Everyone was super satisfied. For dessert we shared the peanut butter pie. Loved that it was textured and the chocolate/graham cracker crust was delicious. Definitely will go back next time we are in the neighborhood.",1
2912,7,5,4/7/2012,Best place for brunch in Hells Kitchen. This place is perfect for groups not exceeding 4 people. They have just 2 tables to seat a group of 4. All others are perfect for 2 people. This is a BYOB place (Yay!) and absolutely brilliant food. Their mashed potatoes are absolutely amazing. The owner is a good guy. Friendly and welcoming. Perfect for a Sat or Sun morning brunch. They don't take reservations for brunch... it's a walk in and wait times are usually about 20-25 minutes if you go there during 10:00 am to 12:30 pm.,1
2913,7,5,4/6/2012,One of the best brunch places in town.,1
2914,7,5,4/1/2012,This is such a great brunch spot. It's small and cash only. The wait is always pretty short. The egg scrambles are delicious! They also serve fresh squeezed oj. Get the baguette with cheese and raspberry sauce to start - it was so good!,1
2915,7,4,3/31/2012,"Great restaurant. I had the pork chop special and mushroom soup of the day, both were delicious. The place is also a BYOB! Just make sure you have a reservation. Â Was given a crappy seat bc I walked in, a five star otherwise.",1
2916,7,4,3/30/2012,Brunch here is fantastic. I had the smoked salmon and cream cheese egg scramble. The coffee was good and the scramble was nice and fluffy with lots of smoky salmon flavor. I'd recommend this spot for a nice quiet brunch without the fuss of the usual trendy new york brunch places.,1
2917,7,4,3/25/2012,"Definitely a nook. 8 tables in the place, you have to walk through the kitchen to reach the bathroom which is an interactive adventure. Do not go here with over 4 people because it'd be too crowded and the owner will probably be annoyed at you. The other two people of our party were 20 minutes late and we got angry stares from him the entire time. The food is delicious!!! I recommend the roasted chicken stuffed with spinach and ricotta cheese, the lamp, the mushroom cigars and the CHOCOLATE MOUSSE! *BYOB* Â No cork fee! Â It was definitely a simple, clean, upscale place where foodies go often. It has dim lighting and they serve coffee and espresso. Expensive indeed, but we did all get appetizers, entrees and 2 desserts and the food was welllll above average. Total was about $170. We'll probably go back again with just the two of us and a bottle each.",1
2918,7,5,3/22/2012,"Che Buon Ristorante!!!!!! Â This place was incredible...It is small and romantic...but it was a big pleasure eating here. Plus they have a little bench out front to sit and wait., which we did but it was well worth it which I was informed of by people exiting. It is BYOB which always catches my interest. i usually stray away from mushroom dishes, but the mushroom cigars were delectable. As a entree I had the filet mignon, cooked perfectly and I've been craving it again ever since. If it wasn't so popular and hard to get in then I would have gotten it too. Of course everything on their menu looked delicious. The staff and chef were very friendly and accommodating as well. Excellent place.",1
2919,7,5,3/17/2012,"This is my go to spot - for brunch, lunch, or dinner. and BYOB doesn't hurt - even though I would come here only for the food. The burger and fries is sensational and the soups are out of this world. If they have tomato soup - order 2. love love love this place.",1
2920,7,3,3/14/2012,"Teensy place, aptly named. Â Came for dinner although I hear brunch is the highlight. Tried the mushroom cigars (basically minced mushrooms wrapped in fried phyllo dough). Tuna tartare with avocado puree, soy ginger was nice but I think a bit too sweet. Â The Thai Marinated Grilled Rack of Lamb was sweet too rather than savory... but loved the accompanying chive mashed potatoes and braised cabbage though. Friend got Konrad's Goulash with egg noodles (slow cooked beef in spicy tomato paprika sauce) which she said was ok. Â Tuscan chicken stuffed with spinach and ricotta was very rich and filling. Â Overall, a bit underwhelmed by the food. Despite this, like the fact its BYOB no corkage fee and the ambiance is very nice. The guy who serves the whole resto is very amicable. Â Wld try again for brunch though",1
2921,7,4,3/12/2012,"what a delightful little place! Â nice and small so it's impossible to get TOO noisy, comfy little bench outside for us lepers (smokers), and very tasty food. Â i had chicken stuffed w/ricotta and spinach ... delicious! ... and the peanut butter pie, i'm still heartbroken i forgot to take the leftovers with me ... my dinner companion had the filet mignon, and she loved it ... it also didn't hurt that there was an adorable polish guy manning the tables/register. Â he made me a really good cup of coffee although i was, as i always am, apprehensive of buying coffee anywhere but a coffee shop (if i have to buy it). but seriously, nook is definitely a gem in this city. Â i am from central pa, so when i'm dining in new york, i often feel i am spending way too much for way too little, especially when out to eat -- but i say that i did NOT have that feeling about nook. Â it was money well spent, the price was almost unreally reasonable for the portion & taste. Â and i will enthusiastically return, as they're within walking distance from an apartment i visit in NYC. for dinner on a week night, i think you would be fine. Â went there with a friend without reservations. just be smart & steer clear of here on weekends. WARNING: they really don't draw much attention to themselves.

2922,7,4,3/8/2012,"Went here for brunch on the recommendation of a foodie friend. They don't take reservations for brunch so I was expecting a line but we got seated right away (prime brunch time too, around 11 AM, but there was a line of about 6 people when we left). Girlfriend wanted the eggs benedict with salmon. I wanted to try one of the egg scrambles but read so many great reviews about the french toast that I chose that instead. Loved the french toast--so light! Not a strawberry fan so the topping didn't really add much value but it was great with just a touch of syrup. The eggs benedict with salmon didn't bowl us over like the french toast did. It was good, not great, about what you'd expect eggs benedict to taste like. Girlfriend liked the dressing on the greens on the side though. Coffee was also good.",1
2923,7,5,3/5/2012,"I am SO HAPPY to find a go-to restaurant in Hell's Kitchen. . I kind of don't want word on Nook to get out, but I also want them to stay open, so here I am. The Tuna. My God, the tuna. Bring wine!",1
2924,7,4,2/28/2012,"Nook is one of my favorite places in NY, mostly because of the fun times I've had there with friends and old boyfriends. Â The food is really great; the lamb chops are perfecto. Â My only problem with this restaurant is that they don't have a liquor license which makes life harder for my inner alcoholic. Â I don't understand how a restaurant in New York City functions without a liquor license, but there you have it. Â Whatever, every time I go there we usually end up getting drunker than normal because everyone brings a bottle. Â  Â  Booze aside, Nook has a cozy, fun atmosphere. Â The owner is super cool, and the patrons are usually small groups of friends or people on dates. Â There's nothing flashy or funky about Nook, but that's why I like it. Â It's sort of a hole in the wall, non descript joint that has great food!",1
2069,7,5,2/26/2012,"I can't even find the place at first... It was so small.. Can I consider this place as ""hole in a wall""??? I think so... You wouldn't even think that they served such a great brunch... You even have to wait outside for a sit.. You won't be able to walk inside the restaurant if someone is standing inside.. Catching up with a friend... Deciding where to eat for brunch.. Of course.. YELP is the best tool.. I brought him to Hells Kitchen area... NOOK came out to be the top... Why not.. Just try it!! :) To be honest.. with the price.. You can get a decent meal... I heard that they served Fresh Squeez Orange juice and also great coffee.. I ordered the coffee.. Yup.. Yelpers are right.. They served great coffee... I ordered the Nook special scramble eggs with smoked salmon, cream cheese and scallion.. The waiter told me that it's his favorite.. He looked at me and ""THUMBS UP"".. Yes.. I know.. I made the right decision.. Before brunch was served.. We were served with some bread... The bread was not too bad to enjoy... Not my favorite bread.. but ok.. :) My friend ordered the eggs benedict with smoke salmon.. It looks really good.. Only got a bite.. can't really comment much about it.. But I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the salmon scramble eggs... The combination of cream cheese and salmon with scramble eggs... AWESOME!! Yes.. It's awesome!! Not many restaurant will have this!!! and the mash potatoes... I LOVE IT!! Not a big fan of mash potatoes.. but the mash potatoes were so tasty.. no gravy.. It's just potatoes.. and probably salt?? I guess it's their specialty too?? Since it's orange in color!! WOW!!! CASH ONLY GUYS!!!! I just love NOOK!!! The table next to me ordered potato pancakes.. I will try that next time!! YEAH!!!",1
2925,7,4,2/23/2012,"Had brunch here this weekend and my goodness this place is TINY! The waiter had to pull out/in tables to fit people, but there's a reason why there's still so many come back to this place. The brunch here is very decent and portion is quite generous for what we had. We were provided with complimentary bread slices upon seating and were told they have very good coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice, so I ordered an OJ to start. Then, the Hubby ordered his egg benedict and I ordered the egg florentine (the major difference between the two is that there was spinach on mine and none on his). Both came out beautifully done with salad and homemade mashed sweet potatoes on the side. We had a very satisfying brunch and recommend that you give it a try if in the area. PS: If your party is over 4, it's going to be very very hard to seat everybody together at the same time and you may be waiting for a long time. Also, they won't seat any group until everybody is present. Â CASH ONLY.",1
2926,7,5,2/20/2012,"I was recently recommended by two people within the same week to go to a little place called Nook. I was also told that you NEED a reservation here because of the size of the place. They were totally right. I showed up, and at first the whole place was empty. Within 5 minutes, everyone showed up for their 8pm reservation, and the whole place was packed! This tiny no frills hideaway happens to have amazing food, along with another great perk, it's BYOB!! So of course my friend and I brought a bottle of wine to share. Before ordering, I had much hesitation because everything sounded amazing! Not only was the waiter, very personable and friendly, but he was willing to customize the dishes in any way I wanted. I originally was leaning towards ordering the Steak Frites because of the rosemary fries that were included in the dish, however, the waiter recommended ordering the Filet Mignon and pairing it with the fries from the other dish! I got to have my cake and eat it too! I was a happy girl :) The filet mignon was a great cut of steak and was also served in a balsamic reduction that was just divine! I wanted to soak up the sauce with anything I could dip into it! They cooked it to perfection, which for me is medium rare. It was also paired with asparagus and the highly anticipated rosemary fries, which were just as flavorful as I was hoping for. I have to admit, that the word ""fries"" in any entree, kind of makes me want to order it...such a bad habit. I was very happy with these fries, as they were not overly greasy and had the perfect amount of rosemary. My friend ordered the Pan-Seared Atlantic salmon, which was accompanied with asparagus and chive mashed potatoes. I didn't taste the salmon, as I have a hatred for ""cooked fish"" unless its shell fish, or raw sushi style fish, but I did taste the mashed potatoes, and they were good! I would definitely suggest this restaurant to anyone. It is good for a romantic date, a birthday dinner, regular night out with friends, or even parents visiting in from out of town. But, remember it's cash only, you must have a reservation because its a small place, and be sure to bring a bottle or two of wine! There is no corking fee. I also thought it was extremely nice that they weren't trying to rush us out of the restaurant even though we had finished our meals. The waiter let us stay there until we were done with our wine and still didn't seem to care whether we left or not, which was how most restaurants should be! Enjoy!",1
2927,7,4,2/19/2012,"My go-to neighborhood brunch option in Hell's Kitchen. Quite appropriately named as it seats probably 20 diners at most. There's usually a wait of about 15-20 min on weekends but the real con is that in the winter you have to wait outside the restaurant. Oh yeah, the host also pulls triple duty as waiter and cashier as well. Â Affordable prices and reliably delicious food keep me returning over and over again. I have yet to find another brunch joint in NYC with as good of scrambled eggs as Nook. Highly recommend their apple pancakes as well. A great place for a weekday lunch, with amazing fries. I still haven't gone for dinner but it's BYOB with no corkage fee, which is a favorite option of mine.",1
2928,7,4,2/19/2012,"My wife and I stopped off there at the last minute to close off our anniversary weekend. Â Definitely a fortunate find. Â We stopped in there for brunch, and really enjoyed the food. Â The highlight was the Nutella, strawberries, and bananas on baguette. Â A couple of things to be aware of before you walk in. Â One, I am sure it has been said here many times, but this place lives up to it's name. Â It's Â a very tight space and you may have to wait for a table. Â Second, they only accept cash, but it's worth the extra trip to the bank.",1

2930,7,4,2/15/2012,"Visiting New York and came to the Nook for Brunch. Â We had 3 people, so it was a little more challenging to seat us since the majority of the tables are 2 tops. Since we had an odd number we waited for over an hour outside. Â Once we got in the food was delicious; i'm not sure if it was because we were so hungry or what. Â There was 1 guy running the whole restaurant and it didn't show; he provided quick and friendly service. Great food at a great place.",1
2931,7,3,2/13/2012,"Came here for dinner armed with 2 bottles of wine between two people with high expectations. This place is riding on its coveted BYOB reputation, as there is a profound lack of BYOBs in the city, what with all the trend of newly acquired liquor licenses (curses). The place is tiny and lacking in decor, and the food was alright. We got the mushroom cigars to share, which were really good, and I got the goulash, which was flavorful, but the meat was super dry and tough. Service was great, we probably outstayed our welcome, but overall, Nook just wasn't impressive at all. If it didn't have the BYOB policy, it should be completely overlooked. I hear brunch is totally worth all the rage though, so maybe I'll give that a shot.",1

I will be back next time I am in New York especially since its around the corner from the hotel I like I stay at.",1
2933,7,4,2/12/2012,This place is a gem. It's byob which I absolutely love. Â Been here a couple times but my Â favorite is the veggie sandwich without a doubt. I'm a sucker for goat cheese. Also their soup of the days are always excellent. Their cauliflower soup = yummmm. Had the mushroom soup before too which is also delish. It has a home cooked feel to it. Only problem is that it really is like a nook and cranny so if you're going for brunch (which they do not take reservations for) Â get there early or you'll be waiting a while for seats!,1
2934,7,2,2/8/2012,"Easy/decent-ish spot. Main perk = BYO. I heard good things from multiple people about Nook. The food did not blow me away though. My chicken was good, but it wasnt original or overly tasty. The cheese plate we got as an appetizer was good, but not presented in an appealing fashion. The meal wasn't better than what i could have done at home. The atmosphere is cosy and the service is friendly. The prices are very reasonable as well. Â  Loved that it was byo though.

Â It is literally a nook though so if you're claustrophobic you may want to steer clear. Â We sat at a tiny table by the host's station/kitchen, we didn't even have to order because the owner/waiter overheard us discussing what we were going to get so he simply confirmed it with us. Â We had a delicious sea bass and a shrimp dish. The food was great, also it is a BYOB which is rare to find in NY, so that was fun.",1

Definitely a small place, and I could see how waiting would be a problem if it was busy, but it was 6pm on a Wednesday so we walked right in. Â I hate waiting awkwardly in a restaurant for my company to join, so the bench outside (60 degrees in February, I'll take it) was a nice welcome. Â Service was quick and friendly, and I could see the chef cooking our salmon in the kitchen! Â (Also might be because you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom.) Anyway, we both ordered the salmon with chive mashed potatoes and asparagus...delicious! Â I normally don't like mashed potatoes at all, and I cleared my plate.

2939,7,3,2/1/2012,Came here with another couple on a Friday night for a casual dinner. It is BYOB so this is a fantastic place to bring a couple bottles of wine and enjoy a pretty great meal at a very reasonable price. The ambiance was nothing notable- it is pretty small but by no means uncomfortable. The service was very attentive and the owner came out to greet us and elicit feedback for the meal. I ordered the tuscan chicken which was a roasted chicken breast that came with chived potatoes and mixed greens. The chicken was good albeit not as moist and flavorful as it could be. We also had the cheese and fruit plate for the table which was a fantastic assortment of nice cheeses. I would recommend this place for a casual BYOB dinner with a date or with friends if you're in the area.,1
2940,7,2,1/31/2012,"Dinner Review Don't bother SO many better places on 9th for dinner.. Diner burger, bistro price. Meat was overly fatty and overcooked. Fries were fine, but nothing special.

We had to go to him to get our check to leave. No credit card. BYOB, HOWEVER, if you BYOB, you must spend $15 per person. Will never be back. Not a 4 star Yelp place for sure.",1
2941,7,4,1/25/2012,"Nook is cute, small, Â and inviting. Â A friend and I decided on a whim to try Nook for an early dinner before heading to the NY Metropolitan Opera House for an evening at the opera. A bottle of tap water was on the table, and after our order was placed four slices of nice, crust bread was brought out, with butter. Â The butter was ice cold and rock hard, but the bread was tasty. We ordered the Mushroom Cigars -- they some sort of minced mushroom rolled in phyllo dough with truffle oil, and some nicely dressed greens on the side. Â The Cigars were delicious. Â The serving was small (it could not accommodate more than two people) but the mushrooms and truffle oil were rich and savory. We each ordered the Chicken kabobs. Â They come with a nice cucumber, tomato and yogurt salad, with dill, as well as rosemary fries. Â My friend stuck to the menu order; I asked to substitute chive mashed potatoes for the fries. Â The chicken was not dry, and was seasoned nicely. Â There were slices of squash, onions, and peppers between the chicken chunks. Â The yogurt salad was nice and refreshing. Â The mashed potatoes were very nice. Â They were not the best I've had in my life, but I wasn't looking for the salt & pepper, or more ice cold, rock hard butter. Â Food wise, we really enjoyed our meal. The only detractor the our enjoyment was the other table of diners there. Â They were LOUD, and in my opinion pretty rude. Â I understand that everyone has a different volume, AND that the restaurant is really small, however I wish these people would have put some effort into using their indoor voices. Â I suppose a restaurant waiter or manager probably isn't going to ask anyone to quiet down if they are just talking, but I think that someone should have stepped in when one woman decided to take a phone call using SPEAKER PHONE! When is that ever appropriate? The manager would have been well within his rights to ask her to take it off speaker phone, or to please step outside. I was appalled by their behavior and sad that the restaurant staff didn't really seem concerned by these animal. However, most of the fault lies with the patrons, so I won't detract from this rating. Cash only, fairly reasonable prices. Â Nice beverage selection, coffee & tea wise. Â We stuck with water. Â I'd consider coming back.",1

The mushroom cigars appetizer is really rich and pretty darn good. We then had the Tuscan Chicken and the Beef Goulash. Both dishes were great (and came with fairly large portions!), but the best word I can think of to describe the meal was ""wholesome"". There was some kind of cooked-at-home-but-fancier feel to the meal, and it was thoroughly enjoyable. The only downsides to this place are that it's tough to get a table without a reservation and that it's fairly cramped (I wouldn't try to go here with more than a party of 4), but the food more than makes up for this!",1
2942,7,5,1/22/2012,"Atmosphere: The place is small. Hence the name Nook? It is cute and cozy and was not at all crammed when me and the bf went for brunch although the tables are basically touching each other. The decor was very holiday festive. Food: I had the pancakes. The raspberry coulis that came with it was awesome. Usually I can only eat half a plate at a restaurant, but this was so good, I ate almost all of it! Service: The service was great. Our waiter was very attentive and nice. Overall it was great for brunch and I will definitely return. I want to come back for dinner!",1
2943,7,5,1/19/2012,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in the city! Everything on the menu is absolutely delicious, from the benedicts to the french toast to the coffee. The savory plates all come with a refreshing salad and these AMAZING mashed potatoes that make brunch at Nook quite unique. Unlike other restaurants, the apple pancake is not drowned in sugar and cinnamon but rather has little pieces of apple that gives it just the right amount of sweet & sour. The french toast is also very moist & flavorful and comes with an awesome home made raspberry coulis. The fresh coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice they have is also the cherry on top of a great meal. I've also been here during lunch on a weekday where they serve a salad/sandwich combo for ~$10 - Great deal for great food! Lastly, the guy who owns the place is very nice - always gives us a smile and is very honest about the food on his menu when asked. Even though there's always a wait during brunch, they're very courteous and never get impatient with you. The place, true to its name, really is a nook... but I think the ""cozy"" atmosphere makes it more New York :)",1
2944,7,4,1/17/2012,"Great intimate, cozy spot! We went here for brunch on a Sunday. The food was great. My husband said the nook burger was the best he ever had. John (I think that was his name) was an awesome host/server/concierge. Â The atmosphere is very welcoming and when you add BYOB, well that makes this a come back to spot. Rememeber to bring a great bottle of vino and cash because they don't accept credit cards.",1
2945,7,4,1/15/2012,"Thumbs up if you are considering this early in the morning. Â But if you're going during peek hours, I would think twice in the extreme winter. Nook is very small, but it is that perfectly cute type of place that appeals to NYCers. Â There is really only enough room for the diners and the waiter to walk through the tables. Â When they are at capacity, you must wait outside. Â  The service is delightful. Â I am amazed that this one guy can service nearly 10 tables. He definitely has a very specific system and it works marvelously. Â I think it's pretty amazing that they are so busy and capable that they will even recommend to folks with large groups a restaurant down the street, rather than rudely have them wait forever. Â  As for the food, you can't go wrong. Â We had the eggs Benedict and one of the popular scrambles. Â Both were perfect brunch type fair. Â  All and all an enjoyable experience.",1
2946,7,3,1/15/2012,"Have gone past here a million times. Limited menu and cash only. I had the apple pancakes. They were good. Guests had croquet Monsieur, which he said was just ok. Others had eggs Benedict . Â The potatoes were great. They need a walk in box outside as it was freezing inside. Every time the door opened we froze",1
2947,7,2,1/10/2012,"I wasn't that impressed. We came here a few weeks back with a large group. The food was average at best and the owner got into a yelling match with one of his employees. It was a bit awkward, considering we were the only people in the restaurant and they were fighting like a couple of 'see you next tuesdays'.",1
2948,7,5,1/8/2012,"Had a birthday dinner at The Nook last week. The restaurant is small. There were 4 other groups of 4-6 people each and that filled the restaurant. Felt very comfortable though. Didn't feel cramped. There were six in our group, one of whom got there late. The owner (I'm assuming) was fine with that because we were able to order for our delayed member. As noted previously, the mushroom cigars are great. Chicken, shrimp and steak dishes ordered by our group were all delicious. Service was unobtrusive, The cost is very reasonable, especially when you factor in the ability to bring your own wine. Remember to bring cash. No credit cards. I won't hesitate to return the next time I visit NY. Bonus: Short walk from theater district.",1
2949,7,5,1/8/2012,"I found out about Nook through searching for BYOB restaurants on Google, and it was a great surprise. Â We changed our reservation from 2 to 3 at the last minute, so we had to wait a few moments, but the owner (Conrad) was very accommodating and friendly. Â The price was great - we got a first rate NY meal for 3 for $70. Â Can't beat that. Â Conrad was great and even encouraging about opening all our wine bottles. Â Good food, good price, good service in a sweet neighborhood. Â Check out Nook!",1
2950,7,4,1/7/2012,"Tiny, tiny, TINY space so either arrive early or expect to wait (outside). It's BYOB, which is hard to find in NYC. Take advantage! No corking fee, no bottle limit. Food was delicious. It's a small menu and the quality and presentation was excellent. The owner runs the whole show (at least he did when we were there). I recommend this if you're in that part of town.",1
2951,7,5,1/3/2012,"What a great neighborhood spot and BYOB - bonus!! Â  We walked in without reservations on a Tuesday evening and were lucky enough to get a table immediately. Â I would strongly suggest reservations as this has all of 9 or 10 tables. Â  The food was delicious; Â the mushroom cigars are a must! Â We had the steak frites (rosemary frites were super yummy), lamb chops, and goulash and we all were very happy with our selections. Â  Our server Ramon was probably the best thing about the meal however... Â attentive but not over bearing, very personable and knowledgable. Â Not only did he encourage us to open our second bottle of wine but he gave us a complimentary dessert. Â  We will definitely be back!!!",1
2952,7,5,1/2/2012,"For such a delicious breakfast spot with little to no seating, I was surprised how short the wait was. We got a table for two in 5 minutes and while it is a bit packed, I actually rather enjoyed the atmosphere. Plus the eggs florentine and orange juice was incredibly delicious. The option to bring your own alcohol is great, I just wish we had known before hand.",1
2953,7,4,12/28/2011,"This place is amazing. Despite the uninterested Polish host/server and the ""approximate"" reservation timing, this joint is a must. Â Just make sure to make a reservation. The mushroom cigars were mind blowing. The beet and goat cheese salad was define. Â The goulash was simply scrumptious. Â The roasted chicken just cluckin' awesome. Â And the best part....BYOB. Do not pass the up. Â Take your lady here, she'll love it.",1
2954,7,4,12/21/2011,"Returned here for brunch recently after a year plus hiatus. Tasty, well prepared, generous portions of traditional brunch food. Don't expect to be blown away by creativity, but expect consistency. BYOB, but who does that for brunch? I'd rather buy a bloody mary.",1
2955,7,4,12/18/2011,"Dinner with two other couples Thursday was great...byob and sounds like we were lucky to get a table in the small place. Tuna tartar, mushroom cigars and lamb were so good. Â Service wasnt great or too welcoming but the waiter/manager seemed to open up to us as the meal went on.. Definitely didn't rush us though which was nice. Â I'd come back the food was really good.",1
2956,7,1,12/17/2011,"I come here ALL the time and I LOVE this place. I usually deal with the owners horrid behavior because the food is that good, UNTIL last night. I called two weeks ago and made a reservation for 4 at 7:30 pm. When my sister wasn't able to join I called back and changed it to 3 at 7:30pm. Apparently the owner put us in the book at 7pm even though I had spoke to him twice, and my family would not have even arrived in the city to make a 7pm reservation. Then when I came in he was rude, told me ""he didn't make mistakes"", and wouldn't seat us at his four top. I can't even count the number of times I have eaten here because I come that often!!! I probably will go back, but my suggestion is call every single day to confirm your reservation and speak slowly like you are explaining something to a child. OR go on Saturdays when Ramon is working!! He is the best : )",1
2957,7,4,12/12/2011,"Went here for dinner the other night. Place was packed but cozy and very cute. I had the shrimp and cous-cous dish. Being Mediterranean, I am usually extremely suspicious of cous-cous, but it was delicious. The shrimp tasted very meaty and rich. My dinner partner had the goulash which was also pretty yummy (but not as good as the shrimp, which really was fantastic). I wish we had time to try some dessert! Waitstaff was very courteous and kind Â I'll be coming by here again soon.",1
2287,7,5,12/4/2011,"So good! I came on a Friday night with a friend. We each brought a bottle of wine (woohoo BYO policy!) so we knew we were in for a fun night. We shared the mushroom cigars which were delicious. I ordered the seared salmon, which was cooked so perfectly that I practically licked the plate off afterwards. The place is pretty small and very easy to pass by, but it's definitely worth checking out. Needless to say, we killed our two bottles of wine and had wonderful conversation over a delicious meal.",1
2958,7,4,11/28/2011,"Dining at Nook is strictly a matter of luck -- first of all, it's very easy to pass right by, given its tiny size. Secondly, regardless of whether you have a reservation or not, your likelihood of being seated is directly related to how crowded this place is. And more often than not (given the small number of tables), every single one is filled. Nevertheless, as a satisfied diner remarked to me on her way out, it's absolutely worth the wait. Nook is cozy and romantic, which explains why so many other couples were vying for a table. Nook is also BYOB and accomodates medium-sized parties, which explains why half of the dining area was occupied by two parties celebrating birthdays. And Nook serves up the very best food in this part of town, which explains why I was there. For a place of its size, the menu selection at Nook is pretty impressive. There were very few items that DIDN'T sound incredibly appetizing. I was forced to choose the mushroom cigars as an appetizer and the Thai-marinated lambchops as an entree (my date ordered the country salad and the filet mignon) and save the rest of my wishlist for next time. Everything was cooked to absolute perfection, and the flavors were rich and complementary. On a chilly winter evening, there is nothing so comforting as the dishes Nook serves up. Chive mashed potatoes... mmmm, creamy goodness. The meats were grilled and seasoned impeccably. Goal for my next visit -- save room for dessert!",1
2959,7,5,11/27/2011,"What a find! Â We were looking for a good, not too expensive, place to eat before a show and I found ""Nook"" on Yelp. Â The food was fabulous, and, since there were five of us, we tried a lot of it: Â mushroom cigars and tuna tartar for appetizers, steak, salmon, the peppered sashimi tuna and avocado plate, chicken kebabs with the famous rosemary french fries, and Tuscan chicken (a chicken breast stuffed with spinach and ricotta with Parmesan sauce). Â All were all given rave reviews by the members of our group. Â They don't have a liquor license but you can bring your own wine, which we did, and there was NO corkage fee. Â That really cut down on the cost and the whole meal, for five, including tip, was under $150.00. Â It's not a big place, hence the name, Nook, and can only seat about 20, so make a reservation if you can. Â Also, plan ahead because it's cash only. Â P.S. Â I had read the review that said the owner, who was also our server, was rude, but he was fine with us. Â We loved it and will definitely go back! Â Enjoy!",1
2960,7,4,11/26/2011,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday. This place is aptly named - the waiter had to drag out the table in order for me to get to my seat. Yes, it is that small. My boyfriend had the eggs florentine which were pretty good. I had the apple pancake which really looked more like apple fritters mixed with a little pancake mix before frying, and came what seemed to be cranberry sauce. It was very good, but the portion was a little small. The staff (all two of them) are also accomodating: I asked to change my water glass as it looked dirty, and he did but also explained that the glass was actually scratched and not dirty. Looking over the other reviews for this place, I will be back for dinner one day! And also, cash only!",1
2961,7,5,11/21/2011,"My favorite restaurant in NYC, though it's up there with Craftbar. Â I think the difference is that it seems like everything here is a hit - you don't have to study Yelp to figure out what the best things to order are, because everything is good. The food is absolutely delicious and everything we ordered was amazing. Â I had the soup of the day (cauliflower soup) and the Thai lamb as an entree. Â The guy I was with had the spicy shrimp, which he loved. Â He also had a salad, which was delicious, but I cannot find the one he had on menupages. The food was unique, delicious, and comforting. Â The interior is small and cozy (very much a nook). Â Since it's BYOB, the price of the entire meal was about $60 with tax and tip, which is definitely a steal for the quality of the food. Â The service was entertaining, since the waiter/host is very funny - but he got our order right and the timing of the food service was great. Make a reservation, though - this place is tiny. Â It was full on a Wednesday night.",1
2962,7,1,11/20/2011,"I dined here more than 1 year ago and had a great experience. I was so satisfied that I suggested this location to my gf for her birthday celebration this past Saturday. She contacted Konrad (I believe the owner) about 10 days before her date and made a reservation with him for a party of 8-10. She wasn't sure of the exact number so he told her she had time until 2 days before the dinner date to let him know. No problem. She called back 2-3 more times during the week to agree on the price fix menu and then called back 3 days before the dinner date to confirm the final number of the group (#9 people). On her last call, somebody else answers the phone and tells her that not only she's not on the reservation book, but also that the restaurant is fully booked for the night. She obviously freaks out and ask to talk to Konrad to get this straight. There was surely a misunderstanding since he had been communicating with her for the past 10 days. Unfortunately, she's told by the employee that Konrad is in Poland and is not available to talk. Bottom line: my gf had to find a last minute restaurant for her b.day celebration, which we all know it's not that easy in this city on a Saturday evening. Konrad's behavior was very unprofessional. It's a real pity that such a good restaurant is so poorly managed. Really? You take the reservation for 8-10 people, completely forget (on purpose or not) to put it on the book, and then disappear in freaking Poland completely careless? No bueno, Konrad. We wish you good luck for your business (even though it doesn't look like you need any, if you can afford to treat your potential customers like this), but we won't recommend you anymore to anybody else. Shame on you.",1
2963,7,3,11/20/2011,"Went for brunch on a Sunday. There is nowhere to wait inside so as usual in New York expect a cold wait outside in the winter for a table. Space itself is nice albeit small. Service was friendly but flaky given only the manager appeared to be working on our visit. My croque monsieur was not great. The cheese was cheap American cheese which made it pale in comparison to any other croque monsieur I have had elsewhere. If you are going to serve what is fundamentally a ham and cheese sandwich, use decent cheese. It does exist in the US despite rumours to the contrary.",1
1748,7,3,11/14/2011,"Crazy pantsssss. Â  OK, first I have to say maybe it was the fact that this place only has 10 tables and the guy was having a bad day......but the manager YELLED at a table for being late for their reservation. Â They were a party of 10 and taking up half his tables. Suggestion to management: DON'T TAKE RESERVATIONS. This place is super popular and will fill up much quicker. Suggestion to the masses: MAKE A RESERVATION. Â If not, good luck. So after this, a little shooken to the bone by this guy crazy screaming, I really wanted to hate this place..... Â Service was very slow, they forgot our app, but its BYOB so we were entertained and the food was fantastic! Ordered: Mushroom Cigars: FANTASTIC!! (even though we got them after our entrees) Steak: perfectly cooked, awesome rosemary fries Lamb: Bomb.com, nice portion, awesome Dessert: Peanut butter heaven Note: if you can handle horrible service, possibly waiting in the cold, possibly someones screaming in your face or the table next to you, the food is WELL worth it, not to mention BYOB is incredible. I would never take my parents or a date here as they would be appalled by the service. CASH ONLYYYYYYYYYY",1
2964,7,3,11/9/2011,"Showed up a few minutes late and my date had already been waiting outside for a few minutes for several minutes. Â Another girl showed up several minutes later and got seated before us, supposedly because she had reservations -- though the waiter never asked her name or time of reservation. Waiter immediately opened our bottle of wine, which was nice considering it's BYOB. Food itself was meh. Â Got the burger, didn't have a great burger taste to it, nor did it have fantastic toppings to make up for it. Â It was reasonably well-cooked though and fairly juicy. Â Not a great value at $15. Â Date got the tuna, which was just ok. Â Not sure if I come back -- if I do, it will only be for the BYOB. Â Though apparently you have to spend at least $15 per person, which kills the deal somewhat.",1
2965,7,3,11/8/2011,"Honestly, it wasn't that great. Food was pretty good. I got the lamb chops with rosemary fries - it was all just pretty good and I expected it to be amazing.

2966,7,5,11/7/2011,"When I moved to NYC, I was told to try my best to explore as many restaurants as I can rather than repeating the same places every week. When it comes to Nook...I can't stay away!!! Its name surely comes from its size and adorable space. It truly is a nook! First of all, service is undeniably friendly and attentive. So much so that I visited for a second time with a group of friends for my birthday and have now frequented this gem 5 times total. The first 2 times, I ordered the Tuscan Chicken (which is stuffed with spinach and ricotta cheese with a delicious cream sauce overtop and mashed potatoes and salad on the side). It is A-MAZING. I have also tried the burger, filet steak, and the pasta. Each time, I have been beyond satisfied with my experience. So much flavor and decitant taste! Possibly the best part of Nook is that it is BYOB--what a money saver that can't be beat! The dishes range anywhere from $14-25, which is already a steal for the gourmet selections on the menu, so when you add in your own beverages, it's even better! Ramone, one of the restaurant staff, is so great with his guests. He takes care of you in every way possible, including storing your bottles of wine or beers. For our latest visit, we stopped at one of the local bars and filled a growler of beer and Ramone help serve it the entire night! I know I should try other places, but when you got a good thing going on, it's hard to resist! Visit Ramone and send my best, you won't be disappointed. Be sure to make a reservation, it's often crowded. xoxo",1
2967,7,4,11/5/2011,The service definitely leaves something to be desired however this is one of my favorite places to continually visit in the city for it's consistent menu execution and it BYOB policy. Try the mushroom cigars and tuna tartar appetizers and the lamb chop entree and you will not be disappointed.,1
2968,7,4,11/3/2011,"Brunch: Fantastic egg scrambles, absolutely no space (I mean the waiter has to pull the table out so you can sit), perpetual line outside .. still totally worth it.",1
2969,7,3,10/31/2011,"I ate here once quite a while back, cute little neighborhood spot, cozy, BYOB. Cash only. Â Not good for large groups. Food pretty decent, though the one thing I recall is not having enough carnivorous options.",1

Â After reading the reviews I was a little nervous on how accommodating they would be...but let me just say - this place is the bomb. Â (do people still say that?) It's a tiny place, but Conrad took our reservation for 8 (at first 10, then 12, then 8) on a Saturday night without any hesitation. Â He made it clear that instead of the $35 flat fee that they usually charge for large groups, we could order off the menu with the stipulation that everyone in the group has to order an actual entree. Â I guess I could see why people might find him a little off-putting, but hey it's his restaurant. BYOB (no corking fee) is AMAZING. Â Rosemary fries are AMAZING. Â Chicken was AMAZING.

Its a nice twist on fries with a slight hint of rosemary. The steak was pretty good...cooked just right (I asked for medium rare). The balsamic sauce that they drizzled on the steak wasn't too shabby either. We were the only people there during our lunch hour...and there was no one else there at the time...but I'm pretty sure it can get crowded with only a few parties in there because the place is pretty small.,1

Actually, I didn't even get to the food part, that's how horrible it was. I had reservations at 8 (per yelp recommendations) and we arrived around 7:30 so I decided to pop in and let the host/waiter/manager/unknown restaurant employee know that we were there early if they had space for us, otherwise we'd wait. Well, I didn't even get to propose the idea; as soon as I walked into the teeny space the Â host/waiter/manager/unknown restaurant employee just looked at me and started shaking his head in the left to right 'no' motion - seriously. He shook his head at me like I was a 2 year old waddling into a china store. W. T. F. In what kind of industry is it deemed acceptable behavior to shake your head at someone? I'm a human, use your words. Obviously we walked down the street and ate somewhere else - because that's what you do in any city with lots of food options, you say F U back. Thanks host/waiter/manager/unknown restaurant employee for making my dinner wait nonexistent.",1

We started with a green salad with blue cheese, pears and walnuts. I am usually an only meat kinda guy but this salad was yummy even for me. The 4 of us ordered 4 different dishes and all 4 of them were excellent. We ordered the Salmon, Shrimp, rack of Lamb and the Filet Mignon.

2977,7,4,10/4/2011,"the wait during sunday brunch is bearable. when they say ""nook"", they mean nook! a very tiny space where you will rub elbows with fellow brunchers. the eggs florentine are the tops. the eggs are perfectly poached and the yolks will run all over your salty ham, wilted spinach, and chewy english muffin. not to mention the hollandaise is rich and golden like the sun. you must have their iced coffee drinks or the iced belgian hot chocolate. it is a cross between a milkshake and chocolate milk. really smooth, creamy, and chocolatey. one person in the front serving the entire restaurant and he still manages to keep a smile on his face.",1
2978,7,5,10/3/2011,This place is crazy delicious!!! I highly recommend the steak frites. The balsamic vinegar steak sauce is sweet and tangy in the exact right proportions. The rosemary fries are perfect and even the salad dressing is delicious. The salmon is also amazing. Enjoy!,1

We came for a girl date to celebrate the arrival of my friend's wine that she had ordered when she was in Napa. So BYOB was clearly appropriate. I had the Spicy Citrus Marinated Shrimp while my friend had the Pan-Seared Atlantic Salmon and we also shared a side order of rosemary fries. We both really enjoyed our food and the fries are as good as they say they are! My shrimp dish came with a little mound of couscous and spinach in the center with alternating shrimp and lemon wedges surrounding it. Definitely visually appealing. Our waiter and I believe also owner, was super friendly and accommodating, until the end of our meal. I guess my friend and I were taking a tad bit too long on a Friday night to finish our bottle of wine, so he told us that we had to leave as he needed the table.

2984,7,5,9/19/2011,"Went here for dinner Friday night. Place is really tiny, so if possible, definitely make a reservation or you might be waiting a while for a table. First star because the restaurant itself is adorable. Lots of tiny tables, very intimate dining experience, but without feeling stuffy or uptight. Second star because the waitress was absolutely delightful. She was very attentive and even offered to wrap up the leftover blue cheese from our appetizer salad for us to take home! That brings me to the third and fourth star--the FOOD. Oh my goodness. The food was really delicious and very reasonably priced. My boyfriend and I split the pear and blue cheese salad, which was a perfect starter to the meal. I ordered the peppered sashimi tuna for my entree. The portion size was ginormous. I couldn't even come close to finishing it, and I love me some sashimi tuna. Final star is a big one because Nook is a BRING YOUR OWN. In my experience, this is definitely a rarity in New York. Don't miss dinner, brunch, or lunch at this delightful midtown spot.",1
2985,7,4,9/15/2011,"Cute spot! Â And by cute, I mean definitely cozy, but if you get a table along the wall it's not nearly as cramped as the booth side. Â  The food is straightforward, nothing too crazy and awe-inspiring. Â Good for when you're in the mood for simple but well done. Â  The mushroom cigars are yummy and unique -- be careful though, when you bite into one it's hotter than it looks. Â The portobello mushrooms are pan-seared wrapped in flakey filo dough with a layer of goat cheese. Â Results in a nice smooth texture -- goat cheese and mushroom go well together in this ""cigar"" -- that's not too mushroomy. Â The filo dough adds a nice crunch. Â  I had the sashimi-peppered tuna and avocado with mixed greens and a house balsamic vinaigrette. Â Fairly priced at $17, and true to my first impression of the restaurant from its menu, it was a simple dish that was well prepared. Â The black pepper on the tuna added a nice crunch and flavor without overpowering the fish. Â  My friend had the salmon with chive mashed potatoes and asparagus. Â it looked pretty good, though I'm still reluctant to order salmon at a restaurant unless I'm limited by a prixfixe. Â  I would come back here for dinner and to try the brunch. Â We waited maybe 10 minutes for a table on a Wednesday night at 7:30pm. Â Not bad at all.",1
2986,7,5,9/5/2011,"What's not to like? The food far exceeded my expectations for Sunday brunch. Nice touches for a tiny place such as fresh squeezed orange juice and frothed milk for my coffee. Everyone seemed to be having a nice time and enjoying their meals. Considering the single waiter for easily 12 tables, he was pleasant and very attentive. We'll definitely return.",1
1930,7,4,9/3/2011,Great little place. The lamb tasted fantastic!,1
2987,7,5,8/22/2011,"Was in NYC with a group of, there were 8 of us on a Saturday afternoon, we called ahead by about 10 minutes; they were able to seat us with in 5 minutes of arriving which by itself is impressive considering how tiny the place was! We had 2 bottles of champagne with us (BYOB!) and they had fresh squeezed OJ. It was a perfect match. In our group we had the seared Ahi Tuna Salad (very pretty presentation), quiche, and eggs Benedict - all very good. We also ordered two servings of rosemary fries since they were so amazing. We had slice of PB pie to top it all off, which was impressively light tasting. Despite the other reviews, I have to say that our server Ramon was AMAZING, and really made the meal for us. He also recommended a place for us to go for a drink after our meal, which was just perfect. Reasonably priced, cash only was a little annoying.",1
2988,7,3,8/21/2011,"I think it's hard to find a good place to eat in Hell's Kitchen especially a brunch place but Nook was a nice surprise. The place is tiny and had one waiter and three cooks in the back. Â We waited about 10 minutes on a Sunday afternoon which is not bad! Â The turnover at this place is really high. Â no bloody marys on the menu ensures that diners are not hanging around talking. Hubs and I shared the eggs florentine (eggs benedict with spinach) and the potato pancakes. Â the egg dish was perfect. Â the eggs were poached to the right temperature which ensured that the yolks was runny and warm. Â The hollandaise was delicious and complimented the salty ham and the english muffin. Â ""home fries"" that came on the side was strange. Â It's not really home fries at all, its a spicy mashed potato of some sort. Â Not bad. Â The potato pancakes were really dense. Â You could get this with sausage or salmon and we got the sausage. Â It was very salty as well and after eating one, it was like a rock sitting in my stomach and I couldn't eat any more. Â It's not bad tasting it's actually pretty good, but just not my cup of tea. Reasonably priced and we will return!",1
2989,7,4,8/18/2011,"My friend and I went to Nook for dinner on a Wednesday. We had a reservation, so even though this place is so tiny, we were seated right away. We bought a delicious bottle of red wine on the way there, since it's BYOB. They opened our wine and gave us wine glasses as soon as we sat down. We started off sharing a few plates - the tuna tartare and the mushroom cigars. Both were delicious! Then for an entrÃ©e we split the shrimp with couscous, which was very tasty. For a sort of dessert/small plate, we then ordered the fruit and cheese plate. The food was great and inexpensive, especially when you can bring your own bottle of wine!",1
2990,7,4,8/18/2011,"If you are looking for something superfast and simple - just turn back now. If you are looking for good food, a slightly crass waiter, and BYOB keep on keeping on! I took a friend here last night for dinner in the hopes of it being exactly as I have read below in the reviews and it was! Â The place was small as stated. Â We walked in told the waiter how many and he said to wait about 10 min for someone to leave. Â Yeah no worries, I'll wait. Â The place is tiny of course a wait is expected. He came back out after 10 min or so and made sure that we knew it was BYOB and brought something which we did. Â Thank you SIR! Finally we went in and sat at the table. Â The waiter was a little rough around the edges but most likely due to the fact that he is not American and this is NYC. Â We chatted him up a bit and cracked some jokes and he loosened right up. Â He put our beer in the fridge in the back. We started with an appetizer and chose the Tuna Tartar. Â Let me tell you, it was awesome! Right off the bat I had good feelings about my entree to come. Â  I ordered the Tuscan Chicken and my friend had the Steak Frites. Â Holy Moley! Â They were both awesome. Â For a tiny place with 2 cooks in the back I didn't mind waiting for how awesome the food was. Â The waiter kept brining our beer out and we had a great time. Â  Worth the money...YES Worth the wait...YES Worth the rough around the edges waiter... Definitely",1
2991,7,4,8/14/2011,"We had a great Brunch on a rainy Sunday! Short wait at noon, about 10 minutes. Service is hectic, but friendly. There is no pressure to leave even with a line outside. The egg dishes were flavorful and just the right portions. A nice cappuccino. The best part is that the prices are awesome! Cash only.",1
2992,7,4,8/5/2011,"Read all about it...This Nook (no words); is a great little spot in Hell's Kitchen! Food is delish...Great friendly Service! Strongly recommend making a reservation & taking advantage of the BYOB, (A huge+)...also Bring cash, they don't take credit cards.. I've been twice now & they were extremely time conscious & got us out in time for the curtain! We Sat in the Window...people watching was priceless!",1
2993,7,5,8/4/2011,"Go to Nook for dinner!!!! 3 things: First, make a reservation. Second, bring cash (cash only accepted!). Third, be patient with the service. I've been here twice and the first time the waiter kind of huffed and puffed when we ordered salads (he was unaware that we were also about to order a glutenous amount of appetizers and entrees). Working in the restaurant industry myself - I get it. They don't want people sitting for hours drinking your own booze and not really ordering food. It's a business - they need to make money. And rightfully so, the food is amazing. The first time I came here was for one of my girlfriend's birthdays. I had the cauliflower soup - so delicious, even friends at the table who are not huge cauliflower fans loved it. Then I had the garden pasta. I kind of ordered it on a whim and then panicked because why would I order pasta at a hole-in-the-wall non-italian restaurant. But then it came out and I was delightfully surprised! The veggies were fresh and perfectly cooked in a light tasty sauce - it was delish. They even let us bring in our own outside birthday cake and they also kept the 6 (yes, 6) bottles of wine on ice for us and replenished our glasses all throughout dinner. I went to Nook again last night with my boyfriend for our anniversary. We both admitted the meal couldn't have been any better. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. I had the chicken entree and my boyfriend had the ahi tuna, both of which we loved. Then we finished with peanut butter pie (fat kid alert!) and cappuccino. It was the perfect cozy spot to relax, drink some wine, and eat delicious, homemade, and well executed food. There was only one guy in the kitchen and one server, so you really felt that time and thought was put into your meal. Overall a great place and we will be back! :)",1
2994,7,2,7/30/2011,"I'm so torn about this place, because while the food is really good, my friend and I had a really bad experience with a rude-as-McEnroe waiter during dinner a few weeks back. We get there at about 5:30 for an early dinner, and we're the only people in the restaurant. My friend brings a half bottle of wine from home because it's BYOB. She orders an 8 dollar salad, I order 15 dollar chicken kebabs. The waiter snaps ""You know you need to spend 15 dollars a person to drink your wine."" We were kind of shocked. Nowhere on the menu did it mention that. We're the only people there, for goodness sake we only have half a bottle of wine, just let us drink it. We don't listen to him and just keep drinking it. He left us alone after that, but we couldn't believe how rude he was. The food got to our table pretty quickly, and it was delicious. We were venting as we savored the perfect yogurt sauce on my place (she kept dipping bread into it) about how we wanted to hate this place because of the rude waiter, but the food was too good for us to hate it. So, I guess make sure to spend at least fifteen dollars a person if you want to split half a bottle of wine over dinner, and enjoy the food.",1
2995,7,5,7/29/2011,"I love this place with all my heart ! While there usually is a wait on the weekends, the atmosphere is homey and the location is a quick escape from the clamour of the city. I love everything on the menu and everything is well priced. I love the rosemary potatoes and the salmon eggs Benedict. Go ! If not for the food, for the unique Nook experience :)",1
2996,7,5,7/25/2011,"Great breakfast place, just about every dish is great, I don't love the potato pancakes but that's just me. This place is small but cozy and it's BYOB if you want to crank it up a notch. I'll be back for sure.",1
2997,7,4,7/24/2011,"Really tiny hole in the wall, which translates to long wait times for weekend brunch - an hour or more. The French toast and the eggs Benedict are yummy. The coffee is ok. The place, minus the wait, is perfect for a cosy weekend brunch.",1
2998,7,5,7/23/2011,"I've only been here for brunch. Â God, I love their nutella, bananas, and strawberries on baguette. Â It's simple, but so freakin' good. Â Their potato pancakes is delish too. Â I'm going to come back and try every item for brunch they have, lol. Â LOVE IT!",1
2999,7,4,7/22/2011,It's BYOB super friendly staff and their filet dish is awesome. Top 5 brunch spots in hells kitchen.,1
3000,7,4,7/22/2011,"I'm a little bit thrilled that there is such a great little brunch spot at about an 8 block walking distance from me... It's definitely small, hence the name of the place, Nook, barely holding even 30 people if that. Â The host, who was also the waiter and the server, was fabulous. Â Considering he was pretty much on his own, he did a good job minimizing any unnecessary lag time. Â Our wait time on a Sunday afternoon at 12pm was no more than 15 min. The brunch menu was simple, but seriously, everything looked really good. Â Started with the Fresh Farmer's Cheese with raspberry comfiture on baguette, which was yum. Â I did wish the cheese was a bit stronger but only because the raspberry was so flavorful. Â I ordered the bacon, chives, and tomatoes egg scrambles which was tasty and not overcooked. Â The ""house home fries"" was basically something like really good mash potatoes. Â The light salad on the side was a nice touch. Â My partner in crime had the eggs benedict which he enjoyed, and from the bite I tasted, it indeed was good but not overly amazing. Â  I gave this place a 4 because it definitely succeeds for what it is and what it doesn't pretend to be. Â I hate brunch places that think they can rip you off for admittedly good food by charging you fine dining prices. Â Cozy, unpretentious, and fun for people watching (we sat by the ""window"" or lack there of) I will definitely come back for brunch to try more of their menu.",1
3001,7,3,7/20/2011,"We went to this place because it was the first place with a reasonable rating that popped up when we Yelped BYOB's near Disiac's. Â I ordered the chicken stuffed with spinach and cheese and served with greens and mashed potatoes. Â Reasonably tasty, but I was hoping to get a little more panache for 17$. Â Service was pretty good about accommodating us, we ordered 2 refills of bread, extra olive oil/balsamic vinegar and extra pepper. Â Be warned, this place is cash only so make sure you got some greenbacks when the bill gets served.",1
3002,7,5,7/18/2011,Best eggs bendict ever!,1
3003,7,4,7/17/2011,"Visitor from out of town, although we lived in nyc for two years so don't discount me too soon! We went to Nook at about 11 on a Sunday, aka prime brunch time, and only waited like fifteen minutes. The place is clearly a neighborhood fave, and I can see why-- good food, friendly owner/sole waiter, fast service. Â A couple of tables remained open even though we were waiting, which confused me, but I think the waiter was staggering the orders for the line cooks, which is smart. SUPER affordable prices ($8-$12 per entree) and nice fresh ingredients. My one suggestion: have soy milk available for the coffee for us lactards! :)",1
3004,7,4,7/8/2011,"Great little spot with creative dishes. Â Really small and the waiter is also the owner/cashier/busboy/host/prep cook. Â Its cool, just be prepared to take your time.. a nice change of pace actually.",1
3005,7,4,6/23/2011,"used to come here all the time with the lady when i lived in this neighborhood. very solid brunch, friendly staff and relatively low concentration of tourists, considering times square proximity",1
3006,7,4,6/20/2011,this BYOB small restaurant has a rock solid menu even though there are not a lot on the menu. Definitely try the mushroom cigars and the lamb . Love them ! Come early and bring CASH.,1
3007,7,3,6/14/2011,"Really cute place, BYOB, stumbled upon it on a rare visit to the West Side. Like many reviews have said previously, very small (prob seats 18 ppl max), and can be quite cramped. Really nice waiter who is the only guy serving all the tables. The food we ordered tonight was only average. I had the mushroom cigars and the salad provancal (beets, peppers, goat cheese, greens), and my date had the lamb with mashed chive potatoes and cabbage. The mushroom cigars were good, but I wouldn't rave about it (the truffle mushroom stuffing was more like a puree, and I guess I prefer more of a meaty consistency). The salad was good, but nothing exciting. The lamb was not tender, and there was just something amiss about it. The mashed potatoes and cabbage were quite good, though. Like others have said: BYOB, Cash only, and tiny, with a solid menu.",1
3008,7,4,6/6/2011,"Ramon rocks! Â I guess those of you who were complaining about service were not lucky enough to be served by Ramon. Â Tried Nook for the first time yesterday and we loved it. Â Started with Country Salad and the very delicious Mushroom Cigars. Â Dinner was marinated shrimp and the only let down-cous cous. Â The shrimp was well seasoned and cooked just right. Â Husband had the rack of lamb. Â All that was left were the bones which he picked clean. Â I heard so much about the rosemary fries that we got a side order. Â SO GOOD. Â Finally, deep dish apple pie ala mode (yum) and the peanut butter pie (OMG). Â We are ruined for peanut butter pie for the rest of our lives!!! Â We will only eat it here. Â  Ramon was great. Â Made us feel so welcome and really knew the menu. Â That is a man who enjoys his job. Â Can't wait to go back.",1
3009,7,4,6/6/2011,"Fantastic little spot for brunch. Duh, it's small - it's called NOOK...you can tell when you walk by exactly how big it is, so don't think they are hiding tables somewhere. The food and service were both great. It seemed like the owner was waiting on us (maybe he was) and he had several friends, one with the most adorable baby girl I've ever seen, come in while we were having brunch. A solid, friendly neighborhood vibe. They have good coffee. I had a burger for brunch, which was incredibly juicy, flavorful, and perfectly dressed with pickles, tomatoes, onions, and lettuce. Â The rosemary fries were enormously portioned and perfectly seasoned/crisp. Â  If you can get a table, grab some cash, your own booze if you'd like, and visit Nook. Â Another perk if you do have to wait is the pocket pooches shop next door where you can watch tiny puppies while you wait Â :)",1

3011,7,4,5/26/2011,"Holy flipping YUM. Â This place is amazing. Â I stopped in with a friend based on the yelp reviews and was not disappointed. Â This place was really amazing and the hot cocoa was some of the best I've ever had. Â  The downside of this place is that it is small and delicious. Â This can be a dangerous combo. Â People will come around and it can get very crowded very quickly. Â Also, don't let your eyes get bigger than your stomach. Â It is more filling than you realize.",1
3012,7,4,5/23/2011,"borderline 5 stars. Â cool little mom and pop. Â holds probably 10 people or so. french toast: very thick and good consistency, but too light on taste. Â not very sweet. apple pancakes: Â small is good because big pancakes = carb overload. Â also, they were not spongy, which is often the problem with pancakes. Â lots of fresh apples. egg scramble with smoked salmon: eggs were light and delicate. Â smoked salmon didnt taste processed or unnatural.",1
3013,7,3,5/20/2011,"So if this was just based on food it would be a solid 5 stars, but its not. Don't get me wrong the place is a gem. Food is amazing and I'll be going back again to try other dishes. Our waiter was very nice and attentive, even though he was swamped. The only reason this place is getting 3 stars is because the tables are so crammed together. Our table was slammed up against another table where people were eating and 4 inches away from a group of girls (ok they were actually adults but they were acting like children). Probably would have enjoyed my dinner more if I didn't have to listen to the 4 chicks sitting next to me bitch about everything from daddy issues to wedding planning woes. Things to note: 1) MAKE A RESERVATION! 2) BYOB. 3) CASH ONLY.",1
3014,7,5,5/15/2011,"I agree with a lot of the other yelpers when they say that the reason the menu is so small is because they focus on phenomenal execution rather than having a ton of different offerings. I came here on a date and had the steak frites, which were surprisingly good. Literally everything on my plate was good: the salad was phenomenal, the fries were seasoned perfectly, and the steak was cooked exactly to my specifications. All in all a great meal. A couple things you should remember: it's BYOB so bring your own booze, cash only so go to the ATM, and finally MAKE A RESERVATION! I saw 5 or 6 couples get turned away by the waiter because the place was packed (only about 10 tables at most). Also, a lot of the bad reviews refer to bad service, but I found that it has to do with the waiter having to do multiple things at the same time, so he can't spend his time talking to customers or really interacting with them as much as some people would like.",1
3015,7,5,5/11/2011,One of the best brunches in Hell's Kitchen. Â  But the place is tiny...so good luck getting a table during peak hours!,1
3016,7,4,5/4/2011,"BRUNCH REVIEW Nook has a small menu, but I think it's because they only want to serve food that they can execute properly. (Thank you for that, BTW) Â  The scrambled eggs with sausage and smoked gouda were fantastic- really tasty and not too heavy. Â The ""home fries"" that they serve with most of the brunch options are heavenly. Â They are more like mashed potatoes, but there's something about the seasoning that makes them uber- delicious! Â  Husband and I share the scamble with the french toast and enjoyed both of them. Â The french toast is made of brioche bread and is served with rasberry compote. Â YUM. Â I happen to enjoy the savory/sweet combination, so the fact that we shared the egg scramble and the french toast was PERFECT. Â  Yes, NOOk is really small. Â The waiter had to move my table out first to let me into my seat. Â We asked for a table at 12:30 on a Sunday and were seated within 20 minutes. Â If you're with a party larger than 2, than I suggest reservations. Â Ask for the table by the window (can seat 4-5) - that way it won't seem so tiny inside. p.s. Service was great! p.p.s. TOTALLY not expensive. Â $27 for two brunch entrees and coffee!",1
3017,7,4,5/4/2011,"Yes the place is tiny...you sit very, very close to your neighbors. Do make reservations unless you want to be shuffled around or be given a time constraint. I'd say those are the only two cons about Nook though. BYOB is a huge plus. The food is very aromatic, tasty and freshly prepared. Not many vegetarian options but otherwise the menu is very good. My brother had the lamb and loved it. The mushrooms cigars were yum too. After our main course we wanted to finish our wine before ordering dessert and they were totally ok with that. We did not feel rushed. Left feeling satisfied and completely full.",1
3018,7,4,5/2/2011,"It is very small - luckily my brother and I went for dinner and it was pretty empty. The tuna tartare appetizer was amazing! I got a mixed green salad with walnuts and goat cheese (or something like that), and it was fresh and light, and delicious. Brother had the burger and said it was pretty good. Fries were really good as well!",1
3019,7,5,4/28/2011,"I wanted to start off by listing my favorite dishes, but I've tried everything on the menu and everything is good. Make sure to get a reservation, the place gets hopping, especially thur - sat evening. If you want authentic American, but better than you've had anywhere ever, get the burger. Worth it. Also BYOB and no corkage fee! The chef is amazing!",1
3020,7,4,4/27/2011,"My husband and I were looking for Saturday Brunch the first day in the city and found this. Best eggs i've had in a while ( I got the sausage and chive scrambled eggs) LOVED the food. We went back on Tuesday hoping to get some of the awesome eggs but sadly they only have the brunch menu on weekends. Instead we had the lunch combo ( soup and half a sandwich with the fries/salad). Tomato soup was great, the sandwich was on the smaller side and way too many fries. The second meal was great too, I wish I had got the salad instead of the fries though. The place is small, but cozy and cute. We found the service good. Loved the music they were playing.",1
1048,7,4,4/25/2011,"At first worried we wouldn't get a spot at 7:30pm, a wave of people left, leaving my friend and I to pick from multiple tables around 7:35pm (on a Tuesday). The menu, we both agreed, offered a lot of awesome options. I'm not sure how we ever picked, but we went with the burger and the borscht. Both were awesome choices. The burger is probably one of the better, juicier, nicely seasoned burgers I've had in the city. The borscht was also very authentic and filling. The decor isn't much to write home about, and, interestingly, without it being full, Nook doesn't seem to have the same cozy charm. But you do feel like you could be eating in someone's dining room, with its tasty, warm, feel-good dishes. I averaged my score up to 4 stars because it's BYOB without a corkage fee!",1
2202,7,2,4/24/2011,Tiny... OK food. Rude service on the day - but will re-visit to make my final judgement. Had poached eggs (florentine). Can't do a soy cap - which is really funny these days and waiter ignored us for ages to order and to get the bill. Can't hang everything on one person so will try again and revise score if needed. Place is very small - kinda annoying. You basically sit next to EVERYONE.,1
3021,7,1,4/19/2011,"Better have a reservation when you come. And make sure your party is all assembled before you even think to step into this restaurant. I didn't have a reservation, but it was empty when I went in. There was no one in the front, not that they'd need someone since the place is at most 10x20. I was meeting a good friend of mine that I haven't had time to catch up with in about a month. I was early, 5:20pm. The place was empty. I asked the guys in the kitchen if I could just sit anywhere and they said sure. A few minutes after I sat down I was given a bottled of water. Another few minutes of people watching and waiting for my friend a couple came in, immediately followed by this blonde, middle age guy. That guy was either the manager or the owner. Very loud and started talking to the couple, asked them if they had a reservation and how many are in their party. 4 they said, the other two was running late. Blonde guy turns to me and says ""And you, what's your story? Is it just you or are you waiting for someone? Do you have reservations?"" Well I didn't have reservations, but with how small the place is, it's ridiculous to need reservations, turnover is easily within a reasonable amount of time. What are they so scared of not having any walk ins? Anyways, I politely answered ""No reservations, and my friend should be here in a few."" The date was set for 5:30pm. 3 minutes after 5:30pm a trio of girls came in and before the blonde guy even bother to greet them he pokes (POKES!) me on my shoulder and says ""You should move here"" indicating a seat over. I had enough of his attitude.",1
3022,7,4,4/17/2011,"Great early dinner here after a broadway matinee. Â I had the tuna tartar- very fresh and delicious with a nice layer of avocado on top. Â The rack of lamb was very tasty. Â The cabbage that came with it was really delicious too. Â Mashed potatos needed a bit of seasoning. Â My husband got the salad with the blue cheese, pear, and walnuts. His angus steak was tasty, but his rosemary ff were excellent. Â  It was excellent. Â We shared the peanut butter pie for dessert which was YUMMY. Â The only negative was the rasberry sauce..just didnt really go. Â Definately can save some money since you bring your own drinks..",1
3023,7,4,4/15/2011,"I thought this was a great place for brunch. Â Good food for a good value - cost us $31+ tip for two. Â We started off with nutella, strawberries and banana on a baguette (4 slices), which was yummy. Â Then we had the veggie sandwich with mixed greens, which was good -and I particularly appreciated that the greens were not drenched in dressing. Â We also had the apple pancake which was crispy on the outside with apple baked inside, so you really could taste the apple, plus the raspberry sauce and syrup. Â The coffee was very good, although they didn't have soy milk. The place is really tiny (maybe 6-7 tables) and very busy. Â We sat by the door and my chair got smacked every time someone walked in the door. Â We arrived at 12:15 and waited only a few minutes, but for parties larger than 2 who got there after 12:30, the wait was probably closer to 30-45 minutes (although there's enough of a following that there were 3-4 parties waiting outside in the rain for that long). Â As another reviewer said, it was amusing that anyone who asked how long the wait would be was told ""a few minutes"" when they clearly would have to wait 45. Â  They should have a list outside so people can write their names down. Â  There was only one server who was super friendly and helpful, but overworked! Â Food came out pretty efficiently.

Â We proceeded to share the best bowl of tomato soup I have ever had in my 33 years on this planet. Â There were bits of pasta, dill and chives...it was fantastic! Â I will return to Nook just to have this soup again! Of the group, my dish was the most straightforward (read: boring) with the Smoked Lox sandwich, however, my friends had the Egg Scramble with bacon and tomato and it was wonderful as was the Quiche Lorriane. Super satisfied Super great find Super affordable brunch.",1
3025,7,4,4/8/2011,"Loved this place. Dined there a while back but forgot to review. I had the steak which was great and the rosemary fries were savory but not overwhelmingly seasoned. My husband had the tuscan chicken which he loved. Atmosphere was cute and cozy but very cramped and made for nice chit-chat with the tables next to us, who were all really congenial and friendly... For weekend evenings, you have to reserve a table our you'll have to sit at the shitty table by the door and get blasted with cold air everytime someone walks in. Overall, very satisfying experience and the service was gracious and laid-back. No pretense and informal. Apps and entrees were great, dessert was so-so.",1
3026,7,3,3/28/2011,"3.5 My boyfriend and I both went into Nook really wanting to like it. I liked that it's BYOB because I much prefer to spend my $$$ on good food and am way less picky with wine (and more than happy to bring my own). Cute, casual atmosphere. Not too quiet where you're eavesdropping on your neighbors, and not so loud that you're yelling across the table. The food was... good. Both of our starters were pretty exceptional. Tomato soup was a top three of all time for us (I don't know how it happened, but we've both become big tomato soup fans) - I think it has bread crumbled into it, or something that resembles the texture of smooshed gnocci. Really yummy touch. And the tuna tartar had a delicious avocado puree on top plated with a soy ginger reduction. The main reason why I'm not giving a 4 is the mediocrity of the entrees. Salmon was overcooked, which is a huge pet peeve of ours. The filet, on the otherhand, was a perfect medium-rare, but was just not a spectacular cut of meat. It didn't have the melt-in-your-mouth buttery taste that you want when you order a filet. The secondary reason that I knocked off a star is due to - not the small size of the place - but rather the way the space is managed. While we were very lucky and got seated in the one row of tables where you can get into your seat without asking someone else to move, the majority of seats are along the wall and the owner was constantly asking people to get up and move to another table to make room for a larger party. I find that request completely unacceptable. Given how small the place is, the owner needs to add a disclaimer that he cannot guarantee sitting parties larger than 4 all together. OMG and I almost forgot. THE PEANUT BUTTER PIE. Seriously, ridiculously, unbelievably delicious. More like a thick peanut butter mouse with chunks of peanut butter and an oreo crust. Basically redeemed the entrees. The moral of the story is: we'll definitely be back. But never before 9:30pm because it'll just be too busy and I hate feeling rushed out. The food was good and I love being able to eat a nice meal and save money by bringing my own wine.",1
3027,7,5,3/27/2011,"Fantastic food! I had the filet with rosemary fries (you MUST get the rosemary fries) and was happier than I've been with more expensive steaks. Â My friend got the cheddar burger and loved it--the patty reminded us of meatloaf--spices made it somewhat unlike a burger, yet very delicious. Â I did not love the apple pie, but I think that may have been a preference thing--too much cinnamon and other spices on that for me. Â Nook is very small, I'd recommend making a reservation to make sure you get a spot, but it did not get crowded til the end of our meal (7:00 ish). Tables are very close, leading to discussion with neighboring diners (""what's that? that's what I'm going to get for dinner"" ""you should--it's amazing!""). Â I can't wait to go back and try the salmon. Â I highly recommend this place. Â Also the waiter (owner?) was very nice, gave great suggestions, and made sure everyone was very comfortable. Â It's BYOB, btw.",1
3028,7,2,3/19/2011,"Honestly, I don't get why everyone loves this place so much. Yes, the food is good - but this place is just TOO SMALL. It's always crowded, and if its cold out, every time the door opens youre going to freeze. We were sitting near the door, and I ate brunch with my jacket on. Yes, the food is very good but just not a good dining experience. There are other really good places in the area (try Riposa or Uncle Georgio's) with better service that are a LOT more comfortable.",1
3029,7,3,3/18/2011,Came here for brunch - food was decent but not sure I would rush back anytime soon.,1
3030,7,3,3/13/2011,"Their name is descriptive and accurate: Nook is small. Small enough that I think it deters from the overall experience of eating there, which is a shame because the food is pretty good. I ended up at Nook one Sunday morning for brunch after having read reviews here and found it to be an overall satisfying brunch experience. I had an egg scramble mixed with gouda and caramelized onions. The onions were caramelized nicely and the gouda was melted into the nicely cooked eggs. The single server was able to be quite attentive to the few tables the restaurant is able to seat, and despite the cramped space he was friendly and not as stressed as I would be in a similar situation. Nook loses some stars for me because the space really is quite small making it difficult to not feel cramped while eating. Additionally, they are cash only, so be prepared for that. I'd give Nook a try to experience some of the more creative things on their menu.",1
3031,7,3,3/6/2011,"Overall, I had a good brunch experience at Nook. The food was great, especially for brunch, however, the place is so small that you're basically sitting on top of strangers. Also, the service was a bit gruff. The host/waiter was not very attentive, and seemed annoyed when I told him that we were ready to order. The food was very good. I got the eggs benedict with salmon and my friend got the apple pancakes. Both were delicious. The coffee was good as well, which is a big plus. It's a great place for brunch in Hell's Kitchen, but it might be hard to get a table because the place is very small. Also, it's CASH ONLY, which I didn't realize until I saw the menu.",1
3032,7,5,2/26/2011,"MAKE A RESERVATION!!! There is only seating for 19 people. They only take cash and it is Â BYOB. We were there Â @ 5 after the theater. Â We were the first customers for dinner, which was a wonderful experience. We got the inside scoop on NOOK. Â We ordered the Mushroom Cigars & the daily soup, which was Mushroom for starters. They were both amazing. For our main course, we ordered Tuscan Chicken and the Thai Marinated Rack of Lamb. Both were fabulous. We were TOO full for dessert but we will be back to try ALL they have to offer. Â Our sampling was just the beginning of a lobe affair with NOOK.",1
2400,7,3,2/26/2011,"Overall I'd give Nook 3 stars, but the food alone is worth 3.5 - 4. Finally came here around noon on a Saturday for brunch after having been wanting to check this place out for over a year. It is no wonder this place is called Nook, the entire restaurant is literally the size of someone's breakfast nook at home! However, they manage to squeeze about 10 tables inside, so diners are packed in like sardines in a can. Every table was full when we showed up, but the only waiter (owner?) told us it'd be 5 minute wait and we went back out into the cold. Soon after parties and parties started showing up in front of the place trying to snag a table, but all were told ""5 minutes."" Is it just me or does he tell everyone 5 minutes? I really don't see how seating time can be consistently 5 minutes if some tables have just sat down while some are waiting for their food. Anyway, the bf and I waited about 10 minutes before a party of two exited the tiny space and we were able to sit down. The brunch menu here is very limited and standard of what you'd find at any American restaurant. Egg scrambles, benedicts, pancakes and french toast, and some lunch items like soup, salads, sandwiches and burger. Â I ordered the french toast with fresh strawberries and strawberry coulis, while bf got the egg scramble with smoked sausage, gouda and onions. My french toast came in three slices nicely dipped in egg batter and fried to perfection. The exterior was crispy while the inside was impossible tender almost like a custard. The strawberry coulis was a great complement to the dish, adding some tartness. They also served some homemade whipped cream on the side which was decadent yet still pretty light. My only complaint, however, was that there was really no fresh strawberries to be found... only half of an strawberry on top of the center slice. I mean half of ONE single strawberry. Despite the lack of fresh strawberries, the french toast was still satisfying. I just wish they would be more honest in their menu descriptions, I felt a little deceived. The egg scramble bf ordered came in a rather small portion, with a small mesclun salad and home fries. It is a stretch to call the side potatoes ""home fries"" because they were definitely more similar to skin-on mashed potatoes. They were, however, deliciously smashed and well-seasoned. Overall bf said that he enjoyed the dish but the egg scramble itself was a bit overseasoned. It's a good thing he has good tolerance for salt, I definitely would not have been able to eat that. I think Nook is a reliable bet for comforting American food, but don't come here expecting to be blown away. I agree that while their menu offers only a few things, they make those few things very well. But because this place is so tiny, it just doesn't make for a very enjoyable dining experience.",1
3033,7,4,2/26/2011,"really really small!!! Â you are almost sitting on your neighbor. Â you literally have to pull out the table to get into your seat. Â so that was a little wierd, but i liked it, it was cozy and fun. Â the chicken kabob was good, pretty safe and typical. Â the lamb was AMAZING! Â tender and a little minty, it had cabbage and mashed potatoes on the side and i usually dont like cabbage but it was good too! BYOB definitely added to the experience, the meal was only $50 with 2 entrees and an app.",1
3034,7,5,2/22/2011,"We found this place by accident and couldn't be happier. Â The food is always top notch! I've been here just for a date night, dinner with friends and I've even hosted a birthday dinner at this place. The servers are always so friendly and the chef is amazing! I love the small but concise menu that always delivers. Â Trust me restaurant owners/chef, I'll take a concise menu with great flavors vs a larger bland menu any day. I've pretty much tried everything on their menu, here are recommends. 1. Mushroom cigars - pan seared portabella mushrooms mixed with sage and goat cheese wrapped in filo dough and lightly with white truffle oil - portabellas & filo dough are just perfect 2. Tuna Tartar sashimi grade tuna and avocado puree with soy and ginger - the BEST tuna tartar ever! The taste of sweet soy and ginger lingers in your mouth while it compliments the tuna 3. Pan-seared Atlantic Salmon served with chive mashed potatoes and asparagus - call me weird but I usually don't like typical fishy smell Salmon gives but it's cooked well and also very fresh. Â When I crave a good piece of Salmon I usually go to Nook 4. Thai Marinated Grilled Rack of Lamb with chive mashed potatoes and braised cabbage - might be a tad bit small for a portion but it is lamb. Â The meat is always cooked to perfection! 5. Sashimi Peppered Tuna with avocado and mixed greens and a house of balsamic vinaigrette - not a personal favorite of mine but I know so many who love this dish at Nook 6. Tuscan Chicken roasted chicken breast stuffed with spinach and ricotta cheese with a light parmesan sauce served with chive potatoes and mixed greens - a great easy dish with a goo of spinach and ricotta cheese compliment the chicken perfectly 7. Filet Mignon - how could you go wrong with a filet? There that pretty much sums up all of the main entree at Nook. Â The place is small but will accommodate to serve a larger crowd, just make sure you call and reserve as they can may be host 30 or so people the entire restaurant. Â The place ONLY accepts cash and it's also BYOB. Â They don't charge a cork fee which also a nice service jesture.",1
3035,7,4,2/21/2011,"This is a great itsy bitsy teeny weeny restaurants I have been to. I went on Saturday for lunch/brunch with three friends, based on other yelp reviews, and was glad I did. I was only able to identify the place by the addresses surrounding it (including a place with puppies in the window next door). The next problem was figuring out how to get in. One could barely tell the front door was in fact a door, and we only saw how to get in when someone came out. This is clearly a place that locals come to regularly. FOOD: Â  The menu isn't too elaborate, but everyone in my group enjoyed what they ordered. I got a veggie sandwich with goat cheese which was served on a baguette. It came with a choice of rosemary fries or a green salad, and, of course, I chose fries. They were crispy and fresh, but no so much rosemary. The waiter said they were famous for their fries, hmm... The portions were the perfect size. There are glass mason jars on the table filled with tap water for you to serve yourself. The waiter promptly replaces the bottle with a new one when yours starts to run low. Two people in my group ordered coffee, which would have nothing to write home about, except that the milk served with it is steamed. I think this was a nice little touch. I would come back next time I am in the area. Food was tasty, and the service and decor was pleasant. FYI, you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom. Also, the place is really tight, so once you sit down, don't plan on getting up until you are done with your meal. Also, CASH ONLY!",1
3036,7,4,2/19/2011,"Amazing brunch!! The only downfall is that the place is literally a nook, BUT it also makes it more charming.

3037,7,5,2/15/2011,Yup! Everything you are reading is very true! I went here for Valentines day made a 8:30 reservation and was seated right away. Very tiny place but I love it that way I made best freinds with the couple sitting next to us! It's BYOB which is always good news for me! I had the Tuscan Chicken and my valantine had the Steak Frites and we were both very very happy. I can't wait to try everything on the menu!

I love the small dining room, and how you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom. I like seeing the food being prepared and the kitchen is very clean. It feels very cozy inside. Definitely make a reservation because the seating is so limited the host/manager has to plan everything out for the night. I have gotten the rack of lamb dish with the cabbage and mashed potatoes twice Â and the goulash once. I tried the rosemary fries which were amazing, and the dill and cucumber salad was also quite tasty. We ordered the special for the night (crab cakes which my friends loved) and I had some of the mushroom cigars which were crispy and super flavorful. The host was very friendly, and accommodating. I will definitely be back; NOOK is a real hidden gem!",1
3040,7,5,2/1/2011,"Amazing food. We tried the mushroom cigars which were okay, but the entrees were out of this world! Our waiter was eccentric, but attentive and the vibe of the restaurant on a weekday night felt unique compared to other restaurants in the HK area. I tried the Thai Marinated Lamb Rack and it was to die for. Sensuous and complemented by potatoes and cabbage. And best of all, you can bring your own wine with no corkage fee. I've tried another place called Ivo and Lulu and was extremely disappointed with that place. This one delivers and will be back very soon!",1

3042,7,4,1/18/2011,"Pros: -DELICIOUS FOOD! -Cute little place, almost romantic -Free bottle service(they don't serve alcohol, but you can bring your own and they will pop the cork for you and provide you glasses) Cons: -SUPER small place -Bread was tough So after a long day of walking around Manhattan, my gbf and I found ourselves in hunger at around 4pm. Thanks to Yelp, we decided upon this place and after much walking, we reached our destination. Place was dimly lit and with little seating area (18 seats to be exact, we counted). Each table had their own wine bottle filled with water. I'm actually not sure if there was a different set menu for lunch and dinner, but I remember not having much to select from. Since it was freezing out, we both ordered the special soup of the day which turned out to be a tomato bisque kinda thing. I'm not a big fan of tomato bisque, but Nook's was REALLY good. Rich and creamy with I believe couscous and the right amount of herbs sprinkled on top. None of the flavors over powered another. Then we proceeded to our entrees and I got myself the roast beef with brie sandwich while the gbf got the vegetarian. Mine had this spicy kick to it, which I think might have been the dijon mustard, along with some sweetness too it, which I think came from the pears (or apples?). His was creamy and rich and filled with different vegetables. NOMS. Their rosemary fries also hit the spot. Their only flaw, the bread that they used. IT WAS SO HARD THAT IT HURT TO CHEW AFTER A WHILE. But it's not like we were about to stop chewing. Definitely would come back if I'm ever back in NY. It's a great place to have a date or a lunch with a bestie. I'm sure it gets noisier when the place is fuller, but when we were there, there was only one other group eating.",1

3045,7,4,1/12/2011,"Had dinner there tonight. NOOK is an amazing restaurant. The atmosphere is great small dining room very cozy, but in this very cold weather if you show up with two people try not to get the table right by the door. The host was great though once a table opened up behind he moved us immediately so we didn't have to deal with the door opening over and over again. I started dinner off with the tomato soup that had really small pasta in it. It was delicious. So Sooo GOOD! I had the rack of lamb for dinner with mashed potatoes the lamb was cooked perfectly, my cousin had the chicken that had spinach and feta i think wrapped in it. That was great as well, I believe they are best known for the chicken. We ended the meal with the hot apple pie, delicious pie with a crispy crust. If you want to eat here make a reservation, they have limited seating so don't just show up. Also it is BYOB so you can bring your own alcohol which is great and they don't charge you a corking fee which is even better!",1
3046,7,5,1/11/2011,"A delicious little gem in the heart of Hell's Kitchen. My friend and I went here for brunch before a musical and the place was packed. Granted, it was Saturday, but my friend insisted that we stick it out and wait. I'm glad I did because this place serves amazingly delicious food! The atmosphere and ambiance makes this place a very cozy and warm place to go for a nice meal with another person. As for the food, each dish was a slight spin on a more traditional fare. For example, I had the eggs florentine, but the ham and the smoked salmon were flavored in a slightly different way (the ham was slightly sweeter..YUM...and the salmon was much softer) than what I expected. The food was inventive and absolutely mouth-watering. I would go again here in a heartbeat! Just a note, the restaurant is tiny! So while this is a great date place, it's not the best place for a group of people.",1

Â In fact, the tuna tartare was good enough to order two! Â The chicken was really tasty, the rosemary fries were fantastic, and the seared tuna was quite good. Â The steak was good too. The atmosphere was really bare.

2420,7,4,12/31/2010,"When making dinner arrangements at Nook, you better like your dining companion(s). Â The restaurant is TINY, so be prepared to squeeze in like this is the E train at 8:30am. The menu is simple and features a few options for appetizers, dinner, and dessert. Â If you proceed to the restroom, you will see why the menu is so limited: the kitchen is TINY. Â It's remarkable that they can prepare a few solid dishes with such space constraints. As an appetizer, Suanne L. and I shared the mushroom cigars. Â Minced mushroom was wrapped in a flaky, crispy pastry roll and had the slight hint of truffle oil. Â These were delicious! Many of the options for the main course are meat, but there are two or three fish options as well. Â I ordered the tuna sashimi-style with avocado and soy ginger glaze, which was served with a mixed green salad. Â When the tuna was lightly seared, a peppery, spicy seasoning was used, which complimented the sweetness of the glaze. Â The quality of the tuna was also very surprising - it was buttery, without being fatty or stringy. I also managed to sneak a taste of Suanne L.'s lamb. Â The preparation was perfect - the meat retained all of its juices and was not overcooked or broiled to an unidentifiable state. Â The spinach was a tad on the garlicky side, so steer clear of any important social obligations if you intend on eating it! The restaurant is BYOB, and fortunately, there are enough liquor stores in the area where this is not a problem. Â Our waiter (who is also the owner, I believe), was helpful in that he was there when we needed him and left us to enjoy our food while the two of us caught up. Â  Make sure you hit up an ATM before dinner, as the restaurant is cash only. I am so lucky to have spent some quality time with one of my best friends as 2010 draws to a close. Â Thank you to all of my Yelp friends who have been some of the most supportive and fun people over the past year. Â I'm looking forward to another year of spending quality time with all of you.",1

However, all the parties after us had to wait a minimum 20 mins. We ordered the traditional egg brunch dishes (various versions of eggs benedict). They were very good. The sauce is just the right texture, but the mashed potatoes that came as a side, they were amazing! Not sure what spices were used, but it really was an extraordinary good potato dish! I wish they would make that a main dish. Overall, cozy atmosphere, good eggs and amazing potato makes this a neighborhood favorite for brunch.",1
3051,7,4,12/23/2010,"Come Thanksgiving, my friends and I trekked about midtown looking for a place that hadn't yet been swamped by the post-parade crowd. The caveat was that it had to be rated well too. We tried 3-4 places before stumbling onto Nook. This tiny little eatery serves a mean brunch special for small groups - and by small, I mean 2-4 people in your group. For my dish, I went with my go-to brunch classic - Eggs Benedict with the hollandaise on the side. No complaints here! I wolfed that sucker down lickity split. Here's where it gets really crazy though - their soup of the day was something rather unimaginative, but my friend passed the kitchen and saw another pot of delicious sitting on the stove. And then we saw a neighboring table get it. It was a classic case of ""I want that!"" When the tomato soup (that's right... good ol' tomato soup) arrived at our table, we all dug in, hoping just to steal some of the warmth for our shivering bodies. What happened in our mouths was unbelievable. I think my taste buds must have gone into shock because that was honestly the BEST TOMATO SOUP I have ever had in my life. The flavors were layered, and it wasn't incredibly complex, but you could still savor each bite. There was some sort of pasta or grain sprinkled in it too, but none of our group could quite name it. The soup alone has me teetering between 4 and 5 stars on this review, but until I have a chance to run back, I'll have to stick to the 4 for now. Can't wait to drag some friends back there with me. Yummers.",1
3052,7,4,12/13/2010,"Loved it. Great food (Tuna Tartar, Lamb chops and Spicy Shrimp) and the owner was a terrific host, making us feel immediately at home, chatting and making recommendations. The prices were really reasonable too, especially when you only pay $15 for a good bottle of wine (BYOB). Only con was the wait. It's a very small restaurant, so we had to wait for a table despite making a ""reservation."" Definitely worth it, but if you aren't a patient person, find a bigger place.",1
3053,7,5,12/10/2010,"I have a new restaurant to get excited about! Harry (my partner) and I walked past last night and saw that there were tables open at Nook - a rare occurrence these days - it must have been the freezing temperatures keeping the more tender New Yorkers home. Wondering what draws so many diners here over the past few months, we gave Nook a try. And I'm so glad I did. As Harry perfectly stated during our meal, Nook and other restaurants like it (i.e. Recipe on UWS) are the best dining outcome of the economic downturn we're still in... less glitz, down to earth spaces that feel like you're eating in someone's personal dining room (or alcove), with the focus placed squarely on the food. Harry had the tomato soup (bright and dill-y) and the rack of lamb, perfectly cooked with a soy and sugar (very Vietnamese-inspired) with touches of ginger and lemongrass. I had the mushroom phyllo cigars - complex and satisfying - and the spicy citrus shrimp with cous cous (very French Moroccan). And we ended the meal with a reimagined, non-traditional apple pie. Delicious. The food is French-inspired, with inflections from the colonial reaches of the French Empire. I immediately thought of Marseilles... in fact, the food here is more southern French than that found at Marseilles restaurant a few blocks south. Nook is a lovely addition to the restaurant-glutted Ninth Avenue. And another great place to dine before or after the theatre. I'm giving Nook 5 stars - on condition that it adds wine to its menu. Because that would be icing on the cake. Wanted to give 4 stars until they get their liquor/wine license, but I just couldn't do it. I'd gladly bring my own wine next time. Looking forward to other freezing evenings that will keep the crowds away!",1

Â I wouldn't recommend this place for a date we came here on a Tuesday night there were about 3 other couples dining here on a date as well But what made me give this place 2 stars was Ramon the host. He was very intrusive and invasive asked us very inappropriate and uncomfortable questions especially because it was our first date.

3055,7,5,12/5/2010,I've eaten just about everywhere south of 57th street. Everything from Momofuku Ko to Korilla BBQ truck. Nook is my absolute favorite restaurant in NYC for a few simple reasons... 1) The Thai-marinated Rack of Lamb (OMFG!) 2) The village-like tiny location. You practically get your own chef. 3) BYOWine,1
3056,7,4,11/22/2010,"I love this little place! It seats about 15 - 20 people MAX and it gets packed pretty quickly. We strolled here on a Sunday morning ready to fuel ourselves before a long day of shopping, and the wait was about 20 minutes for a group of 5. The waiter went the extra step in making sure that he updates us whenever the previous tables finished eating or when they were done paying their bill etc. It always makes a different when someone goes that extra mile to make sure that the guests feel important. The food was amazingly done. I loved their home style potatoes and the salad that came with our scrambled eggs. Everything was cooked to perfection. We also ordered the creamed cauliflower soup and the strawberry, banana, nutella baguette to start, and oh my, it was a party in my mouth. All in all, a fabulous brunch experience. Friendly service and good hearty brunch food, I really couldn't have asked for more.",1
3057,7,3,11/15/2010,"It really is a nook..too small and they need to move around tables for you and if there are more than 4 people in line it might take..just about forever to get seated. There also is no alcohol offered!!! I wish this place served mimosas or something. The service was nice and a bit apologetic for the inability to really fit people..but with a name like that...what is there to expect? I got the spinach goat cheese and tomatoes which was good but not amazing..my friend was a bit smarter and got the one with meat (smoked sausage, gouda cheese and onions) and that was a lot better. I liked the sausage flavor along with the onions for more of a salty tasted oppoed to mine which was diced up eggs with veggies that made it pretty bland. I like the salmon colored/looking sides and the greens were pretty standards. The mushroom soup was a huge bowl that was tasty with bits of mushrooms but could have been put in a more condense smaller cup.",1
3058,7,4,11/13/2010,It is such a cute place but small. I think there are only 8 tables. The brunch here was delicious. I do have to warn you that it is a bit salty but drink more water and eat more bread. The egg scrambles were all great combinations and so soft and full of yumminess. I usually like my eggs drier but these were cooked so well that I didn't mind. The prices were also really reasonable for brunch. 10 dollars per person and we were full.,1
3059,7,4,11/2/2010,"When I read tiny, i didn't quite understand what that meant. Â The server had to literally move the table out of the way so I could sit against the wall and then replace the table so I could eat. Â We went on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm and definitely waited at least 45 min for a table. Â Despite the long wait, the server was super friendly and attentive, and the food was delicious! Â Because I was famished at this point, I ordered the eggs benedict with salmon , and the french toast. Â I am glad i didn't just go with the french toast alone, because it was very sweet.

Â Ate here with a large party and felt like I couldn't even enjoy my meal because of the crowded, packed, uncomfortable ambiance. Â We were practically sitting on the table next to us, and coats and purses had to be sat on or stored in the kitchen. Â It's a 4 man operation (3 in the kitchen, 1 waiter) and the waiter is friendly, knowledgeable, and a little bit intrusive. Â Granted, in a room so small that he has nowhere else to stand but right on top of you, it's best that he's an active participant in your dinner conversation rather than a creepy onlooker. Â All in all, NOT a relaxing environment or evening which is too bad because the food is worthy of more. Â Don't forget it's BYOB (they probably don't have space to store alcohol) and CASH ONLY. Winners: Mushroom Cigars, Rosemary Fries, Salmon, Lamb, and Tuna Losers: nothing really stands out as a major loser, but if I had to pick I'd go with the Steak Frites.

Their rosy potatoes were good too, but I wouldn't call them fries. They would though, and they do. They're very friendly too, which is nice and only slightly overbearing. It would be nice if it was bigger, but then it wouldn't be a nook. It would be Open Space. So they get imaginary points for not selling out.",1

We ordered some breakfast foods, and I thought my eggs hollandaise and salmon was okay, however one thing that confused me was the home fries. Â Home fries in most places consists of either hashed browns, or chunks of potatoes that are fried. Â Their version here is mashed potatoes. Â It's kind of a misnomer, but I can't appreciate that. Food's alright, but I wasn't wowed. Â If there is a next time, I may have to do the BYOB and see how everthing is i- I may have to give this place 5 stars.",1

We had such a great time thanks to him. Â Nook is a small and friendly place, open windows and just a great atmosphere.

3068,7,4,9/3/2010,"For a girls night out we wanted to find a tasty BYOB spot since it seems that we spend more money on liquor then food these days. After taking a peek on Yelp we decided to go to Nook. Â Based on the reviews about how small the place is I made a reservation for 4. Upon arrival we were sat immediately by a very nice blonde haired waitress. Â People weren't lying when they said the place was small. We basically had to rearrange the tables just to get in to our seat but once we were settled it was fine. Â I decided to have the mushroom cigars and tuna tartar. Â They were both delicious. Â The mushroom cigars were my favorite and so tasty. I would love to remake this at home. Â The tuna tartar was also very good. Seasoned just perfect. We saved so much money by bringing our own wine. Â And Nook does not have a corkage fee which I think is silly at a BYOB spot. Â No wine buckets to keep your wine cold so drink quickly but we were content with just added some ice to our wine. Â The only downside to the place, which I thought was very weird and not even sure how they get away with it, is that you have to walk through the tiny kitchen to go to even smaller bathroom. When I used the restroom prior to leaving it kind of creeped me out that we walked right by the stove while food was cooking. Â But could be much worse. Â I will definitely check out Nook again $20 a person including tip probably the cheapest girls night out I have ever had.",1

3071,7,4,8/19/2010,"Nook, a very aptly named restaurant on 9th Ave, is so small you can breeze right past it without noticing. As a matter of fact, it took someone pointing it out to me and me reminding myself it was there to step in and grab a bite. We started with the mushroom cigars which packed a lot of flavor into a little bite. Following that came the tuna tartar which was simple, yet elegant. For my entree, I shared the Spicy Citrus Marinated Shrimp over cous cous and spinach and half of the Chicken Kabobs with cucumber salad and those rosemary fries. Each protein was well cooked and seasoned. The sides were all noteworthy but, those fries - yowza. They were special. Maybe it's that I never eat fries. I can't say to be honest but, I know I can't get those fries out of my head. The last thing I really liked about Nook was the portion size. They don't try to knock you over with big portions - like you were Fred Flintstone at a drive-thru window. They give you a really appropriate portion and I really appreciate a restaurant that shows a little restraint this way. As a restaurant this place has a lot going for it. The menu is eclectic in the best sense of the word with a number of cuisines represented all with new angles on them. On top of that Nook is A BYOB. In all honesty, the only thing standing between Nook and a 5 Star review would be some form of climate control - it gets a little stuffy without AC.",1

Â Well, you CAN at Nook. Â This is a small venu, but it is every bit as wonderful as some of the other places in the hood with waits of 1hr plus. Â  Yvette G. and I shared the tuna tartar appetizer, so good with a mix of ginger and avocado mousse on top with bits of ginger throughout the tartar. Â She had goulash, which was homestyle and excellent. Â I had shrimp with couscous. Â Simply delicious. Â Our bill was $60 with tax and tip, and we left so satisfied.

3073,7,4,8/1/2010,"Praise be to the slightly creative brunch menu. Brunch is tricky for me, because I can cook the expletive out of some eggs and french toast, making it difficult to justify the average eggs order. No matter how brilliant the Scramble--and Nook's options did look brilliant--I just file away the combinations to cook later. That said, my own homemade hollandaise is yet imperfect, making eggs benedict the right choice this morning. Nook's ham is salty and rich, with thickness you'd expect in Texas, not Midtown. The ""home fries"" should have been called ""roasted tomatoey home fry mash goodness."" The apple pancakes I shared with my friend were like funnel cake on apple crack. With tart raspberry coulis awesomesauce. And the server, bless his heart, he does not go out hard on Saturday nights before working Sunday brunch. He runs his ass off and keeps his cool. He refills coffee, busses all the tables, and remembers share plates and extra napkins with superhero calm, his mortality only indicated by a few beads of sweat on his forehead. Nook is cozy. Please read my review, but don't go there too often. I waited about 90 seconds this morning, and I'd like to keep it that way.",1
3074,7,4,7/28/2010,"ok so this is a initial review based on first experience there and for brunch only. Â although i am intrigued to go back back for dinner especially for a BYOB night!

Â we were forunate to get there at about quater to noon so there was no wait but line was definitely beginning to start so during prime hours you can expect to wait. Â Service is a one man team and he was very nice and attentive but i can see if things got hectic it could cause problems. Food & Drink - good brunch menu with normal selections of pancakes, french toast, salads and sandwiches. Â i always go for eggs and they had a good selection except the lack of omelette options. Â specialty seems to be scrambled eggs. Nook Scrambled Eggs with bacon, chives and tomatoes - delicious. Â comes with salad and home fries (very good). Â every bite had a taste of bacon. Nook Scrambled Eggs with spinach, goat cheese and tomatoes - this was excellent as well. Ice Coffee - solid Ice Hot chocolate - was tasty but a bit bitter Overall - definitely will be back for brunch. french toast looked interesting.

If it's hot outside, suck it up. It's worth it. We ordered the Nook Scramble with spinach, tomato and goat cheese. YUMMMMM! It comes with their mashed potatoes and a little salad. Perfectly cooked fresh eggs. We also ordered their eggs benedict. I have never tasted better poached eggs. I asked what the secret was and the server/owner(?) said the eggs are dropped into boiling water with a splash of vinegar and a dash of salt. Delish! And the Hollandaise sauce? Sweet and creamy! Topped off with a couple iced coffees and we were out the door for $25 (before tip).",1

The guy who was supposed to be attending to everybody was a d!ck.. NOT coming back.",1
3078,7,3,7/6/2010,"As a brunch place, nothing amazing. The service was lacking, the place is TEENY (aptly named Nook, I guess). We went on a Monday of a long weekend at around 2 pm and there was no wait. I ordered the croque monsieur, which was pretty disappointing; it literally was a grilled cheese with ham. It came with salad greens (like 2 bites worth) and rosemary fries (much better portion and DELICIOUS -- best part of the entire meal). My friends ordered eggs benedict, salmon sandwich, and scrambled eggs, all of which were pretty small portions but decent. Prices were pretty good ($12 for my meal, $9-10 for everyone else's). The main thing that turned me off was the service. I mean, I'm sorry you have to work on a long weekend but a smile wouldn't kill you!

Service took a while -- there was just one waiter for the whole restaurant -- but once we got our food, it was like magic! I had a benedict, which was delicious. However, the shining star at Nook is the amazing french toast. Two of my companions ordered the french toast and could not keep their mouths shut about how amazingly delicious it was.

3083,7,4,6/2/2010,"Hidden in plain sight on 9th avenue, this place is literally a nook. About the size of an average studio apt, there are about 7-8 tables crammed in the cozy dining area. I would expect nothing less from a genuine New York establishment. Parties of 4 or less are ideal for this place. How can everything on a plate be superb? Too often I've had dishes where at least one or two of the sides are an afterthought. For example, the mashed potatoes may be splendid, but the greens are a wreck or vice-versa. But at Nook, the chefs pay attention to detail to each item on every dish. The salad dressing is amazing and the greens are fresh. The mashed-hash-brown-concoction is other worldly. And the main courses are all excellent. I trade off between the eggs benedict and scrambled eggs. The eggs benedict w/ smoked salmon, is simply heaven on a plate. If you're been searching for the holy grail of holandaise, look no further, Nook is the golden ""X"" on the treasure map.",1

3085,7,4,6/1/2010,"i came here with a few friends last saturday for brunch. in looking for the restaurant, we almost passed it the first time because the storefront is tiny, as is the restaurant itself. there's almost invariably some sort of a wait because of the limited number of people the restaurant can seat, but there's a cute bench outside that you can sit on to wait if you're lucky enough to even get a bench spot. the restaurant only takes reservations for dinner, not for brunch, so try to get there early. i wouldn't suggest coming with anymore than 4 people because there won't be enough space to seat everyone. even at our table of 4, i was sitting uncomfortably close to my friend and kept bumping elbows with him while eating. i ordered the eggs florentine and it was really good. not outstanding though. there's an option to get it with smoked salmon, but that's not my cup of tea. the side of potatoes was unlike anything i've ever had- the spices really make it unique and ohsoyummy. one of my friends ordered the potato pancakes and those were out of this world. they were made more like hash browns, with a crispy fried exterior and a fluffy interior. although they're called pancakes, the name is a bit deceiving because they were much smaller than typical pancakes, only about 2"" in diameter. we were sitting right by the kitchen, so other tasty smells wafted out, tempting me to order everything else on the menu. perhaps another weekend. service here is awesome! the owner was friendly and really funny, and i noticed that he treated everyone like they were his friends, not his customers.",1
3086,7,4,5/22/2010,Very small and cozy place. Well worth the wait. Try to make a reservation if u can buy u will still probably have to wait a bit. It's a gem considering it's a byob. Mushroom figer appetizer was to die for.,1

3088,7,4,5/9/2010,"We weren't planning to go to Nook on a Saturday evening but there were open tables when we walked by so we decided to take this opportunity and try Nook for the first time (I read many reviews about how difficult it is to get a table at this small restaurant). I was hoping to be (almost) blown away from reading the reviews, but unfortunately I wasn't. I should have read the Yelp reviews for recommendations before ordering the food but I was a bit self conscious about browsing Yelp reviews on my iPhone once we were seated at the table. So we decided to ask the host for his recommendation. We had a cheese platter to start - it had so many different types of cheese with a plenty of fruits (pear, strawberry, and grapes). I think there were at least 5-6 different kinds. We very much enjoyed it but in hindsight it didn't give us the opportunity to taste their appetizers. For entree we had the rack of lamb and grilled shrimp. Lamb was very tasty, though a bit overcooked for my taste, but was a very enjoyable dish. Grilled shrimp had good Cajun like spices with cous cous but it was a bit too simple and was not very satisfying. The host was very friendly and charming. I'd like to try Nook again for brunch next time. 22 points on Zagat 2011.",1
3089,7,5,5/2/2010,"Simply awesome. I had brunch with the wife & our potatoes were the best we've ever had. Really good latte. Very tiny place, but the food is amazing!",1
3090,7,3,4/27/2010,"Better for dinner than brunch, Nook serves a charming mish-mash of Euro-food (occasionally French, sometimes Hungarian, maybe Italian or German). Â  For dinner, the much-praised mushroom cigars are standouts, and the goulash is excellent. Â The steak frites is a good fallback choice as well, thanks to the great rosemary fries. The brunch options are all pleasant enough, but even a lazy cook like myself thought I could do many of the better choices at my own house after a trip to Whole Foods. Â I've had the spinach, goat cheese and tomatoes egg scramble, which was...fine, but didn't excite me much, where the dinners at Nook really HAVE. Service is...hard to comment on, since it's basically a one person show -- when we were there last, it was actually the owner who seated/served. Â But, given the challenge of wearing many hats, I've not found the service to be an obstacle -- in fact, it's rather charming. Hyper-tiny, as you've no doubt read, and be sure to BYO.",1
3091,7,4,4/25/2010,At first glance I really enjoyed this place. The small room with 8 tables (one directly behind the entry door) was cozy and intimate. The menu was simple but covered brunch with a few twists. Service was good. I would not reccommend anymore than a part of 4. The place is not really set up to accomodate more unless you want to wait. Our food was good. I have had much better Croque Monsier but the American twist had great flavor. The Smoked Salmon sandwich was great as well. The Rosemary Fries were some of the best fries I have had in the city. Looking forward to a return trip to try the eggs! This place is BYOB and there is a liquor store a few blocks down on 9th.,1

The potato pancakes with lox and cream cheese were really tasty, but I did think the apple pancakes were a bit plain and pretty tiny (3 pancakes, each a little larger than your standard chips ahoy cookie). Again, decent place, but can't think of anything that makes it stick out other than the tininess which is part of the charm I suppose.",1
3093,7,4,4/19/2010,"Came here for a BYOB with 3 others. Â We didn't have to wait long, but only because we made a reservation 2 days in advance. Â I was skeptical about how timely the reservation would be honored, considering how tiny the interior was, but we were out of the rain and into the restaurant within 10 minutes of arriving. It is pretty cramped inside, and we were seated right by the heater, which meant two of our party were quite cozy throughout the meal (could be a good or a bad thing). Â  The waitress was very nice, and pretty responsive. Â They were out of wine glasses when we arrived, which is a bit... ehhhhh. Â I drank out of a champagne flute for a bit, then exchanged it for a wine glass once it became available. The food was pretty good. Â MUCH better than Ivo & Lulu. Â I ordered the Sashimi Peppered Tuna with avocado, which I'd highly recommend to anyone coming here. Â Not only is it gorgeous, but it is the perfect portion, and you walk out feeling pretty healthy and satisfied. We sat around and milked the last bottle of wine after our meal, and weren't pressured to hurry, which is somewhat of a rarity when dining at small places like this on a Saturday night. Four stars for good service, good food, and an overall great experience.",1
3094,7,4,4/19/2010,"I am a big fan of this place...if you can get in. With only 8 or so tables, reasonable prices and really exceptionally crafted yet uncomplicated food, the problem is trying to find a time when you can find a table. Brunch offers splendid items splendidly prepared. Eggs benedict perfectly cooked, and French toast (thick and creamy) with hand whipped cream and raspberry coulis. Even the coffee is special served with hot milk. Here's the trick...do not go here during typical times. Eat brunch at 10:30AM...and you're in!",1
3095,7,5,4/13/2010,"New Yorkers love the non-touristy restaurants, and Nook excels in that category in its location in the theater district. Nook has room for only a few parties and the host and waitresses make you feel right at home. It's great ambiance is helped by the fact that Nook is byob! The food is also creatively delicious at a reasonable price. I would recommend the tuna tartare, it's large and delicious. However the seared tuna with avocado left a little to be deslred in terms of original taste beyond ground pepper. Also recommended is the strip steak, it is cooked to perfection in a city not known for its steaks! Highly recommended, just be sure to make a reservation!",1
3096,7,5,4/12/2010,"I'm hooked on Nook! Before I start my review, you need to know 3 things about Nook: 1- Cash Only 2- There are only 8 tables - make a dinner reservation 3- BYOB The beginning: We had a 7pm reservation for 8people this past Saturday. Â When we arrived our table was not ready (the previous reservation was still eating) so we gave the host/waiter our cell and went to a bar across the street. Â We were not in a rush so when the host/waiter called us @ 7.40 we happily entered the tiny restaurant. Â TIP - If you are on a tight schedule this place is not for you! Â With only a few tables, seating delays are bound to happen. Â  The middle: The food was fantastic - so much so that we made a future reservation on the spot! Â We started with the mushroom cigars (moist and crunchy) and fruit plate (huge). Â Then the group ordered the shrimp, filet and chicken. Â I tried a bite of each and ALL were GREAT!! Â I liked the chicken best so will likely order that when I return. We tried 2 desserts too the peanut butter pie and the ice cream, both were awesome. Overall we had a fantastic night out thanks to Nook's friendly (& funny) service and unbelievable food all for a bargain BYOB price! The end: I would say Nook is a 'hidden gem' but the way the host/waiter was turning people away it seems that the word is out!",1
3097,7,4,3/24/2010,"I'm always a sucker for any BYOB, but once I had the lamb chops I actually will go back for the food. Just remember, there is wine store on 9th and 48th in case you forget to bring your own bottle.",1
3098,7,4,3/24/2010,"The name says it all, around 8 tables in here, the ability to watch the chef cook your entree, and one server/host. We stopped by on a Sunday morning around 11am with 5 people, and were lucky enough to be seated in about 30 mins. Once inside, you really get the feeling a lot of TLC and quality goes into this place. The service is super friendly, the menu is uncomplicated, and the prices are really decent. My gf went with the Salmon Benedict, and I went with the smoke sausage scramble. The sausage scramble was full of flavorful meat and the omelette was perfect on the cheese (I find a lot of places go overboard with cheese). However, I found the dish to be to salty and really overpowered the omelette. BUT, when you pair it with excellent potatoes, you get a good balance. My gf found the salmon benedict to be very light and the fish to be fresh and well seasoned. Watching the big chef dude in the kitchen prepare your stuff was probably just as entertaining enough to warrant a good review. But the food, the coffee (delicious), the prices, and the service all really contributed to a solid experience. I wish it were bigger, I wish there were a little more variety on the menu, but most of all, I wish I could go there a lot more.",1
3099,7,1,3/15/2010,"I really love the food here and the ambience is generally great, so I brought an out-of-town friend here over this past weekend. Unfortunately, it wasn't a pleasant experience, chiefly because of the way we were treated. The Boy called the restaurant early in the morning asking to make a reservation for a late brunch and the man who answered the phone (and is the only person working the floor, being server/waiter/greeter/telephone operator, so I understand if he's a bit snappy sometimes) told him that reservations were not taken at Nook and then hung up. 'Hmm,' I thought, 'that's funny--the website and Yelp both say that Nook takes reservations.' We bundled up and I went inside to put our names on a list, as Nook was characteristically packed. I waited patiently as our one-man-army manned the phones; imagine my surprise when I heard him saying 'yes, of course we take reservations. what's your name? when are you coming in? how many?' to someone on the other line. Still I smiled at him because the food here is fabulous and he looked stressed and sometimes we all make slip-ups. I told him 'party of three (for the Boy, friend, and myself) and my name and then went outside to wait. The rain this past weekend was, as you probably experienced, torrential, so our wait of 40 minutes seemed interminable. The wait was made even worse by the fact that a group of four (that waltzed in 10 minutes after I had placed my name on the list) grabbed a table before us. The Queen B of the group sneered at me that she 'knew the people there' after I innocently inquired if they had made a reservation? 'No, we haven't, but we really want a table.' Oh, right. The rest of us out here aren't getting tables because we don't want them enough. Got it. My friend had a train to catch shortly after brunch and it pained me to see her gazing longingly at the warm, chattering interior of Nook, so I went in and asked the one-man-army if it would be possible for us to get the open table, as we had placed our name on the list first? He just gave me a smile and said 'you'll be seated soon' and then turned back to answering the phones, no doubt taking reservations of people that wanted tables more than my group did. Well. We were *not* seated soon. We waited an additional 10 minutes after the group of four to be seated and my friend was downright frantic at the prospect of missing her train. I assured her that the food here made it all worth it, and it did--but only by a little bit. As someone that really loves this restaurant and frequently recommends it to others, I would advise Nook not to be too complacent about its success. Just because there is high demand for your services doesn't mean that you should mistreat your customers! On this Ides of March, I warn that even those seemingly at the height of their power/fame/glory (Nook = Caesar) can be brought down by those that once supported them (mistreated Yelpers = Brutus)!",1
3100,7,5,3/14/2010,"My roomie and I love to explore new places in the city and NOOK has remained high on our list since we have discovered it. It is such a gem! - VERY SMALL so if you go on a Saturday night it is a good idea to make a reservation but the Saturday night waiter is awesome and we love him. - BYOB!! We love to grab a bottle of wine down the street and bring it in with us. Save on the overpriced liquor and enjoy an additional appetizer because they are fabulous! - Cash only! A bit of a downfall bc you have to com prepared but again: WORTH IT! - The food is amazing. My favorite is the Citrus lime Shrimp with vegetable couscous. They had potato leek soup as a soup of the day and it was to die for. Friends have had the filet mignon, steak frites, lamb, and a ricotta stuffed chicken dish (don't remember the details but she loved it!). Always great!",1
3101,7,5,3/13/2010,"I almost don't want to tell people how wonderful this place is, cause it's become my Nook for a rainy Saturday. It's a BYOB that literally is a NOOK in the wall. There are maybe 8 tables, great music, nice atmosphere, and it's a BYOB! The duane reade down the street has beer, or there is a liquor store next door. Since my roomy and I never have to dish out tons of money on alcohol we don't mind paying a little more for the food. Note: It's CASH only to pay. We usually spend about 30 per person. All there appetizers are amazing! Their lamb is to die for! and on your birthday they give you a nice free dessert! Service is nice. Food is wonderful. I wouldn't bring a big party though. It's a nice place for 4 or fewer to relax and enjoy good food in midtown!",1
3102,7,5,3/10/2010,"We went to Nook based on proximity to our hotel and the good rating in Yelp. It was still surprising how good this restaurant was. First of all, it's TINY, seating 24 people max, but we were able to walk in and get a table at 6 PM. The waitress was very nice, and brought us a basket of good bread and some butter. The restaurant is BYOB, and it was nice not to be bothered (pushed) to order drinks, wine, etc. esp. since we aren't big drinkers. We ordered the Mushroom Cigars based on reviews, and they were excellent, although I would have liked the portion to be a little larger. There was a little salad on the other side of the plate--a bit more than a garnish, and it was surprisingly good. For entrees we had the Salmon and the Tuscan Chicken, and both were really excellent. Others have mentioned the Rosemary Fries, and my wife is lactose intolerant, so substituted them for the mashed potatoes. I've never before had a meal where I felt everything was really excellent but where the French fries were still the best part! We weren't planning on dessert, but based on the rest of the meal we thought we shouldn't skip it and we weren't disappointed: we had the Apple Pie. While it was a touch too warm, we had the ice cream on the side so that probably would have brought it down to the perfect temperature otherwise. Highly recommended, and we'll go again. Remember to bring cash - no credit cards accepted.",1
3103,7,5,3/10/2010,"This restaurant is amazing and the manager/waiter (i believe this is just one person) is even better. Â Made a reservation for a large party on a saturday night, which changed several times and he was so accomidating! the food was sooo amazing and even my friend who hates being in small places said he would go back just for the Steak Frites!!",1
3104,7,5,3/10/2010,"When I stepped into this little restaurant, I was very hesitant to sit down and eat here because a) it was so small, I didn't think service or food would be great, and b) no one was eating there! WRONG! The owner (?) took our order and put these cute little bottles of water on our table. I ordered the sandwich w/ cream cheese and salmon with a salad. I was going to ask for salad dressing when I realized that it was already very lightly dressed, which was PERFECT because it wasn't too heavy. The sandwich itself was delectable -- It had amazing bread, a little tougher than regular baguettes, but it just made the sandwich that much more unique. My friend ordered a ham, brie and apple sandwich, and that was also very good. My other friends raved about the artistry of their sandwiches. No slippin' and sliding; it was perfection. Most importantly, their TOMATO SOUP! Campbell, shame on you! Their tomato soup was amazing, served in a little mug, it was just an amazing consistency with chunks of onion and tomato. Needless to say, I was thoroughly impressed.",1
3105,7,5,3/7/2010,"We love this place. So perfect for a great night of good food when you're in the mood for a good, slow dinner and have a good bottle of wine in hand -- bring your own. Â Make a reservation before you can and go hungry. Great value. Â Great quality.",1
3106,7,1,3/6/2010,"Nook just ruined a birthday at 10:15 in the morning. We had reservations for 8 people for my girlfriends birthday this evening at 8pm. I made these reservations a MONTH ago and they just called me to CANCEL the reservation claiming they overbooked the restaurant with two other parties. This was a complete lie because I was there on Valentines Day and saw the reservation book myself and it only had 6 people in there for 8pm when I made my reservation. Now not only did the waiter just call me at 10:15 in the morning to cancel, he was RUDE about it too. He offered nothing in terms of another reservation or date. We have people in from DC and Boston for this birthday dinner and how the heck am I going to find a place that can seat 8 the day of??? Not only did I do everything by the book, I even made the reservation twice, by originally calling it in for 7 people and then calling a week later to make it 8. He claimed that the person that took my reservation made the mistake twice! He was rude to me for the entire phone call and then abruptly hung up the phone on me. Thanks alot waiter from Nook, you just ruined Meghan M's birthday, THE SAME Meghan M that left you a glowing review on 2/16/2010. This is not how you run a business or treat your customers. I'M NEVER GOING HERE AGAIN.",1
3107,7,1,3/6/2010,"Nook officially ruined my birthday this morning. Â We had a table booked for 8 people at 8pm this evening. Â Knowing the size of this place we made that reservation weeks out. Â 10:15 AM, phone rings. Â It is Nook canceling my reservation. Â Are you kidding me?? Â Who does this to someone?? Now we are stuck with 8 people, most coming in from out of town, and have to find someplace to accomodate us. Â Best part was that the waiter who called to cancel hung up on my boyfriend. Â Unbelievable. Â I will never EVER come here again.",1
3108,7,5,3/5/2010,"Located in the heart of Hell's Kitchen. Very small and quaint spot. So cute & comfy. Â We arrived here early, midweek right when they opened...(11am). It was really nice bc we got the place pretty much to ourselves. Our chef/hostess accommodated us well. I also loved the fact that he played 2 roles. What makes this place charming is you get to BYOB. Yes..that's right. We unfortunately didn't take advantage of that bc we came for an early lunch, and weren't in the mood to drink that early in the morning, but very cool & unique idea! We started with the seared tuna sashimi salad....they were HUGE chunks of avocado & tuna..and soooo good. melted.in.your.mouth like butter & FRESH. I could've had that all to myself as my entree...but we shared it for the appetizer. The hubby had the half soup (cauliflower soup was AMAZING- u wouldn't think something so simple would taste SO good...but trust me..u gotta try it) and half sandwich- he got the chicken sandwich, with a side of fries. I had the veggie sandwich (they serve their sandwiches on baguettes, which i LOVE, and it's brought in fresh daily- and how i know this is bc we got their even before the bread did! lol). The veggie consisted of goat cheese, grilled portabello mushroom and bellpeppers. I loved how all the flavors complimented each other soooo well. Our bill came out to be just under $40 for a chai tea, mocha, an appetizer, and 2 entrees. not bad at all considering the quality and taste of our meals. CASH ONLY though...so come prepared.",1
3109,7,4,2/20/2010,"Really delicious little restaurant, the hostess and server (same person) was really nice and hospitable. Â Tiny place with chairs back to back but cozy and a great place to go with a couple friends. Tuna tartare- the BEST I've ever had, it had fresh minced tuna tossed with this light gingery soy sauce with a thin layer of avocado on top with some balsamic vinegar to dip it all into- YUMMY!!! Â Their mushroom cigars were just ok, a little dry and couldn't really taste the goat cheese. Pork tenderloin with baked potato casserole (daily special so they may not have it every day)- one of the best pork dishes I've ever had, the pork was perfectly cooked and seasoned, with good salt and pepper with fresh rosemary, outside was seared and cooked with the inside soft and tender - fell apart and super moist. Â The baked potato casserole was thinly layered slices of potatoe baked with yummy cheese and spinach. Â Came with a fresh, light crunchy cole slaw. Â My friend got the tuna with avocado entree- slices of both with greens, he liked the dish. Peanut butter pie tasted like a peanut butter cheesecake, I liked it because of the pieces of peanuts in it and the graham crust.",1
3110,7,4,2/20/2010,"Delicious dinner - the mushroom cigar and filet were out of this world, wine reduction on the steak was perfectly done. Great service. Will def go back. Super cozy, nice atmosphere. Food was well thought out and yummy.",1
3111,7,4,2/12/2010,Update - have been back to Nook a few times and learned that the waitress doesn't work there any longer...so the coast is clear! Now it is just good food and great staff!,1
3112,7,4,2/11/2010,"Hell's Kitchen has a number of tiny dining spots, but I doubt any feels as, um, cozy as Nook. I really liked it and would love to go back. Â The downside? I don't like getting up early, and I don't like to wait in line. Â I was extremely lucky to be seated immediately on my first visit. Â My friend and I showed up just as two people were leaving, and there was no line at the time: score! The menu selection is small, like pretty much everything else here, but it doesn't lack the brunch basics. Â Potato pancakes for me, french toast for my friend. Â The french toast looked fantastic, but I'll caution that the potato pancake dish is really heavy. Â The fried pancakes + some kind of sausage (I forget what) = really greasy. Â The hangover selection, if you will. Final note: you will probably be able to see into the kitchen from your table. Â Keep an eye out for the chef. Â Maybe he was just having a good day, but my friend and I notice him spontaneously doing a kinda boogie every now and then! What can I say, I like happy people.",1

My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to enjoy Sunday brunch and escape the ten degree weather. Â Instead, as we tried to open the door, a waiter pushed it shut on us and asked with sign language if we were a party of two. Â He then left us outside for ten minutes, even though there was room to stand inside. Â Instead of freezing, we walked over to Cafe Forant, which both let us in and served a delicious brunch. Â I won't be trying Nook again -- for fear that I might freeze to death waiting for a table.",1
3115,7,4,2/5/2010,"Came on a Thursday night for a date with my mother. Mom eats early like an old lady so we arrived at 5:45. I've passed this place so many times and wanted to go in, the name alone has a special place in my heart because i love small spaces. The place is tiny, at full capacity it can hold 14 people. The owner was SO attentive, checked in with us, asked what we thought when we left, and he also commented how ""beautiful"" it was that my mother and I have such a nice relationship. I got the tuna sashimi with avocado. It was simple and perfect, with ripe avocados and lightly dressed salad. My mom got the chicken kebab and rosemary fries. Fries were nice, the kebab was dark meat which i like and had 4 nice chucks of chicken. For $17 dollar i thought her meal was stingy portion wise. We got the homemade chocolate mousse because we had an hour to kill before our show. It was not overly sweet and they use real whipped cream. The couple next to us got the lamb chop which looked amazing. I'll be back for dinner, the place has a really homey feel and the food is top notch with tons of choices. Cash only, so be prepared.",1

Â Oh and the table of 6 girls next to us that EACH showed up with a magnum of Cavet Pinot Grigio - they were awesome too and ready to party. Â I overheard one of them say, as they were enjoying their appetizers, ""BTW I love tuna tartare!"" Â I didn't know people really spoke like that outside of tv shows that were making fun of them...

3118,7,5,1/21/2010,"Aptly named, Nook not only boasts a fantastic brunch menu, it's also BYOB. I'll write that again to reiterate how great that is: BYOB. FOR BRUNCH. Which means that if you bring your own champagne and add a small pitcher of OJ (graciously provided by the restaurant), you're in for a easy, breezy, boozy, beautiful brunch. Â I tried the spinach with goat cheese egg scramble which was delicious. The place itself is very small (we had to push out the table next to us so someone else could get in) but was the perfect place to snuggle in on a freezing cold Saturday morning.

The tables are two inches apart but you won't mind once you try the food. I love the fact that it's byob and very casual I have had many a weekday dinners here with my fave wine and a couple of good friends. The food is always consistently delicious. Loooove their mushroom cigars I am always left wanting more. The lamb chops are the best they are perfectly juicy and slightly sweet. They come with heaven-on-a-plate mashed potatoes and a great salad. The Tuscan chicken is also verryy very good. Moist, juicy, and perfect. This is also a great brunch spot. Best scrambled eggs in NYC. Also absolutely love their apple pancakes mmmm. Best of all their brunch is super reasonable. Ps. Bring some champagne for brunch and make your own mimosas with their fresh orange juice. and its CASH ONLY.",1
3135,7,5,10/13/2009,OMG this is one of my FAVORITE spots in the city. I went him on a whim for the first time with a good friend to grab a bite! We ended up staying for hrs...got a btl of wine from the liquor store a few blocks over...it's BYOB and it was so much fun. Not to mention the waiter was ADORABLE and soo polite. :) The tuna tartar here is to DIE for. I have eaten at some seriously amazing restaurants...but this hidden gem in midtown is like a slice of heaven in my mouth! This place is sooo small...hence the name and it's such a delight though. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant. I'm making it a habit to go at least twice a month... Oh yeah...cash only!,1
3136,7,5,10/13/2009,"How often do you go out for dinner and the only thing on your mind for the next 30 minutes is ""holy shit, that food was AMAZING""? Â  Well, for me, Nook pulls that string. Â every. Â single. Â time.",1
3137,7,3,10/3/2009,"I would give this a 3.5. It's a very cozy restaurant and the owner is really friendly and comes out to talk to everyone. Definitely a great place if you live in the neighborhood-but probably not worth traveling to. We had a filet that was pretty good, not out of this world, and lamb that was also good but not incredible. The apple pie, however, was superb. I highly recommend going there just for the apple pie on a cold fall evening. The prices were very reasonable and byob is always a plus.",1
3138,7,4,9/26/2009,"There are three things you need to know when you come to Nook: it's BYOB, cash only, and teeny teeny tiny. This place probably seats no more than sixteen seats, max. Luckily, it's also delicious. While I can't recall what we had for brunch, our recent dinner was more than satisfying. The mushroom cigar is the appetizer to get, filled with portobello and drizzled with truflle oil. Normally, whenever a place uses truffle oil it's a little gimmicky. But Nook doesn't let the truffle oil overwhelm the dish and lets the other flavors really shine. The same can be said about their seared and peppered tuna sashimi. Extremely tender slices of fish, cut not too thickly, with a flavorful, spiced rub. Excellent flavors. Still, although Nook's dinner menu is far more memorable than their brunch, I prefer brunch. Perhaps we lucked out on service that time, but the morning waiter was not only overwhelming pleasant and friendly, but he also went out of his way in terms of service. Our coffees never went unrefilled, he complimented by boyfriend's glasses, and discussed the menu with us at length. The evening waiter, however, was on the gruff side and very mechanical. Whenever he answered the phone, he would bark into it, and in such a small eatery his loud voice was on the disruptive side. Either way, it's a cute neighborhood joint. I'd consider returning (after first peeking in to see who's behind the counter), especially since a little BYOB always helps mitigate a little bad service!",1
3139,7,4,9/20/2009,"We were lucky to get the last table that was propping up the door. I considered us lucky. Everyone else was being turned away. Make a reservation in this tiny tiny cozy tiny place. First, I need to say that the waiter, the only one working the front end, is so adorable. Super adorable. The food is flavorful and just perfect in the mouth. CASH ONLY. BYOB. Started with mushroom cigar and we had salmon and lamb chops. I thought the pan seared salmon was fresh and crispy and tender. The lamb chops were sweet and savory and tender. No dessert. We were very full for $60. I want to come back but I fear there will be no lucky table for me.",1
3140,7,4,9/11/2009,"The food is to die for and its BYOB! A must try, even if you hate mushrooms are their MUSHROOM CIGARS, they're brilliant. I always get the mushroom cigars and the salmon dinner. My boyfriend loves the lamb, which Ive tried and very much agree it's delicious. This place is small, hence the name but i did have my graduation dinner here with six people and they were able to accommodate us just fine. But ideally this place is perfect for a romantic date.",1
3141,7,4,9/3/2009,"I live in the neighborhood and can always rely on Nook for a great meal. Â It can be quite cozy at times, but you can't beat it for the byob aspect. Occasionally it is a little hectic as there is usually only one waiter/host... but any possible aggravation is worth it for the price and quality.",1
3142,7,4,8/11/2009,"Yes....this place is cozy. Very cozy. Which means you'll be very intimate with the people sitting next to you. The table edges are so close to the point that Â you will have to get up and scoot your table outwards for any person sitting/getting up. We got a strawberry-nutella-banana-on-bread (I know i know....6 dollars for something I can make at home. But when i want chocolate on my weekend mornings I am willing to dish out a couple of bucks for it). Divine. Although perhaps not Nook's doing but the combination itself. We also ordered scramble eggs with bacon, chives and tomatoes. Sounded simply enough, maybe even mediocre. But what we got was amazing. The bacon was delicious (AND FATTY), and every single bite was something we wanted to savor for hours to come. This place definitely takes 'scrambled eggs' to a whole new level -- it didn't even look like it (although, the only experience with scrambled eggs in the past few years have been with my school's dining hall food so my expectations might be significantly lowered). Home fries were fantastic as well. Definitely a go-to brunch place in Hell's Kitchen.",1
3143,7,4,7/9/2009,"Cute atmosphere, flavorful dishes, and reasonable prices. I ate here twice in a weekend - for lunch and dinner and can't wait to come back for brunch. As a vegetarian I can't give it 5 stars b/c there just isn't enough variation to keep coming back for dinner. However, the veggie sandwich, the mushroom, cigars, the dinner salads, and the pasta were tasty. The peanut butter pie is AMAZING and made on-site. I know it gets busy at mealtimes but we ate at off-times [sunday evening for dinner and a mid friday afternoon for lunch] and had no problem getting in with a sidewalk view. The weather was great and the windows were open.",1
3144,7,3,6/30/2009,"The fact that it is BYOB compensates for the sometimes brutish attitude of the owner and staff at this small neighborhood haunt on rejuvenated 9th Ave. This tiny place seats only a handful of people at a time- so make sure you have a reservation if coming for dinner. Local Hell's Kitchen residents have taken notice and it has become a neighborhood favorite. For dinner, the small quaint atmosphere can make it a bit romantic, but the tight quarters make getting along with your neighbors essential. Favorite dishes include Black Angus Steak with peppercorn and Sashimi Peppered Tuna. Be prepared for choppy service and some attitude from the owner. It is not the friendliest place - which is odd given I usually find smaller places to be warmer in general. Go for brunch - usually it is less crowded, and service tends to be a bit more pleasant. The scrambles are delicious - my favorite is Bacon, chives & tomato. Love bacon, always, always a brunch must-have. Also- It is cash only - or at least was cash only the last time I was there.",1
3145,7,2,6/15/2009,"I checked out Nook's menu online, and was astounded by the prices, so decided to meet friends from out of town there, also liked their BYOB policy. Â When I got there, my friend said ""Pam, uh, isn't this place supposed to be cheaper than the other place we were talking about going to?"" Â I said, ""yeah, why?"" Then, with horror, I looked at the menu and saw that their prices had gone up and that we might as well have gone to the other place for not only the same price but for larger portions of food. Â NOOK - update your menu already! Â I was pissed. The goulash wasn't nearly as good as my goulash, but what should I have expected? Â Also, living in a Polish neighborhood kind of spoils you to the notion of good cheap goulash. Â My friends were happy with their meals, although like I said, the portions could have been way bigger. Â They were out of tuna, at 5.45pm on a Sunday. Â WTF?! Â  I'd only go back here if I was totally unable to go anywhere else in the neighborhood. Â Just not that jazzed about Nook...",1
3146,7,4,6/6/2009,"My real rate for Nook is 4.5-5*, actually, food deserves 5*, Â I felt totally delighted with each bit; Â however can't forget I also felt like eating inside a can and I founded the menu very limited. Been there once for dinner on thursday. Place is cozy, old european/italian style, soft lights.... the owner is really friendly, I liked him. Food was amazing, totally unexpected (in a good way). As I mention before, the menu is very limited, but I'd back just to get the same dishes. We got the Mushroom Cigars with White Truffle Oil = Pasta filo rolls stuffed with a creamy, kind of hummus texture, musrhoom paste..... very tasty, Â intense mushroom flavor dominated by the truffle one. A must try. My friend order the Black Angus Steak. I'm not a meat fan but have to say it looks amazing, not overcooked, juicy... my friend been there several times and always get the same steak.... guess must be really good. I got the Tuna Tartar with soy ginger marinated and avocado over mixed greens. Big fan of raw food, tuna in particular... have to say this was one of the best I had so far. High quality tuna, same level that what you can get in any excellent Sashimi place, with a healthy red color which makes me wonder if I order some meat by mistake. . So tender, flavory, but not overflavored for the soy ginger sauce.. just Perfectly balanced flavors ... remember to make a reservation and BYOB Definitely, a place to try, at least once, and come back.",1
3147,7,5,6/5/2009,"Countless, flawless nights at the Nook compel me to redirect your attention to my adored dishes at this itsy, bitsy joint in unhappy Hell's Kitchen- Mushroom cigars. Vegetarians challenge their meatlessness, and in so, confess that meat-free food doesn't usually taste this good. Â  Tuna tartar. Last time I went, the kitchen whipped me up a special, accompanying beef tartar. It's -so- good, you can't tell it's tuna. Thai-styled rack of lamb. I aptly used the modifier 'finger-licking'. Garnished with braised cabbage, and a perfect heap of garlicky mashed potatoes. Konrad's goulash. Conjured with love by the charming proprietor. Giant ringlets of noodles; bottomless French bread for dippin'. Rosemary chicken. Probably the bulkiest entree option; again, a generous dollop of 'taters.",1
3148,7,3,6/2/2009,"I am wavering between three and four stars. Boyfriend and I had a nice meal here last week, but I am not really dying to go back... for whatever reason, I'm having difficulty mustering up the necessary enthusiasm for four stars, even though there was not much to complain about. However, I'd feel too stingy if I didn't, so four stars it is. As everyone's said, this Nook is a tiny one, to the point where Boyfriend didn't even want to go in. But I wanted to try the rosemary fries and the mushroom cigar, so I told him to hold his elbows close to his sides and not to sweat it. As has been previously reported, the cigar (stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped in phyllo dough is a tasty tasty specimen. We didn't get to try the tuna tartar, but Boyfriend ordered the salad with seared tuna strips, which was crazy good. I got the burger, and while it was really big and had a nice assortment of toppings, it is also probably the source of my less than excessive satisfaction. It was good, I guess, but there was something about the flavor that was just a tiny bit OFF. I tried to enjoy it, but there was something about it that didn't quite do it for me (though Boyfriend had some too and did not share my concerns). Which I guess in the end, is how I feel about Nook as a whole. I wish I could figure it out, because that would make me feel better about my blatant lack of enthusiasm. Maybe it WAS the burger, or perhaps the tough and chewy bread served before the meal. Maybe I didn't get the greatest vibe from the server, who was attentive enough to make me feel uncomfortable... I felt rushed and too embarrassed to get the last third of my big burger doggy bagged, but not for any real, tangible reason. Maybe it was because there no ice in the water, or maybe I just got weirded out by walking through the smaller-than-the-one-in-my-apartment kitchen to go to the bathroom. Maybe I was just too preoccupied worrying about whether Boyfriend was dissatisfied with his elbow room. Obviously, none of these things are really anything to be concerned about, so I'm going to chalk them up to personal taste or an off night on my part, and give Nook a solid if unenthusiastic recommendation. UPDATE: 6/8/09 I've thought better of it, and I really shouldn't feel bad about giving the Nook three stars, so I will. Still a solid restaurant, but there other places I'd rather patronize.",1
3149,7,5,6/2/2009,"Step inside the womb and you'll be taken by the warm host, the comforting food, piquant flavors, and toasty airs. Hard not to come away from this Hell's Kitchen gem, pie-eyed and moony over your dining experience. Only thing I found baffling was their choice of wall art (b+w photos of contemp celebrities) but willing to let that one go. Notables: mushroom cigars, rack of lamb, byob",1
3150,7,5,5/31/2009,"The aptly named Nook is a blink and you'll miss it establishment buried on a busy Hell's Kitchen block. Â But believe me when I say that it is well worth seeking out, as it is one of the best restaurants I've ever had the privilege of dining at. Â  The place is tiny, but on a weeknight, you'll probably be able to get a table even without reservations. Â I'd still recommend it just in case, so that you make sure you're not shut out of a rare culinary treat. Before we get to the mouthwatering food, I'd be remiss not to mention the service. Â The waiter was friendly and helpful, and helped us make the most of our meal. Â He said he was filling in for the owner, but you could tell that he had a real love for the place and the food. Â Nook is BYOB, and he was happy to point me towards the nearest liquor store, so I could enjoy my meal with a bottle of wine handy. Now for the good stuff. I'm not much for mushrooms, but the mushroom cigar appetizer was spectacular. Â I followed that up with a Thai spiced lamb dish that was beautifully cooked and presented. Â Along with a great side of mashed potatoes, I'll be hard pressed to convince myself to branch out next time I'm here.

The service is pitch perfect, the waiter who usually only works brunch was pinch hitting for the owner and he was a genuine sweetheart. Anyhow, all those niceties aside... the food was incredible. We of course got the mushroom cigars (which my mushroom hating boyfriend gobbled up), the salmon which was great and the thai-inspired lamb which was kinda like a party in my mouth (i only got two bites cause it was my bf's). Â The mashed potatoes that came on the side were great as well and then, to top it all off... there was desert. We had the chocolate mouse and it was yum yum yum.

3154,7,3,3/17/2009,"Nook...its okay. the mushroom cigars are pretty tasty. The rosemary fries are rather normal french fries with a bit of rosemary oil- so thye arent exactly gourment, though they are good. Our burgers were very hot and juicy. My fiance didn't like how soggy everything got due to excessive burger juice, but i like it that way. It is BYO - which is nifty. However, the price listed on their online menu do not correspond with the menu they hand you in the restaurant, and then they charged us 14 per burger instead of the 13 per that the menu we had just looked at stated. After all that wine, I didnt care. But I am more laid back about that kind of thing than most people, and I do believe it was done intentionally. Over all, not a bad place for a BYO spot. But in ultra-competitive NYC I will find something better next time.",1

Forget Island Burger--this is the home of one of the strongest contenders for tastiest meat patty on a bun. Yes, there are the amazing rosemary fries. But I swear they must deep fry the meat itself, because it's the juiciest, most flavorful ever. Â  The tuna tartar is also great (avocado, yum!)--you can get s similar dish as entree size too. The steak frites were okay the one time I strayed from the burger (steak was kind of tough for medium rare, but of course the fries made up for it). The Callebaut hot chocolate is rich and delicious as well. The place is tiny but I was able to get a table say 90% of the time without reservations--and if not, it's not like there's a shortage of places to eat nearby. Service is lacking as it's a one-person show...and that person often has major 'tude (or is smoking outside or talking to friends on the phone), but the food is worth the effort. Tip: Cash only. BYOB. Burger. Rosemary fries. Yum.",1
3156,7,4,2/8/2009,"Hell's Kitchen has many, many restaurants - however, this tiny little place succeeds in being a standout - at least for brunch, which is what I came here for today with a couple of friends. If you like to drink at brunch (which I do), this place is BYOB so you can bring in a bottle of prosecco or champagne to mix with your orange juice for some mimosas. Lucky for us, we didn't bring any because the Nook was out of orange juice. Â Minus a half star for being out of orange juice by the prime brunch hour of 1pm on a Sunday. We ordered lattes, which were delicious and light tasting. One of us ordered the potato cakes with salmon, which she said was really, really good. Â I ordered the vegetable quiche, which was flavorful and not too greasy tasting. Â The last friend ordered eggs benedict, which came with a coarsely mashed new potato accompaniment that he said was the real showstopper. Â  All of us agreed that our brunch entrees were absolutely delicious. The restaurant is cash only, which must contribute to the reasonable prices - I don't think any of the entrees were more than $12 and there were quite a few options for under $10. There was only one server for the whole restaurant so service was very slow (although very friendly & helpful) - I forgive them for that, the cramped seating, and for being out of orange juice because we had a delicious, reasonably priced brunch - definitely recommended if you are in the area!",1
3157,7,3,2/2/2009,"I was expecting such good things from this little nook of the city and left satisfied, but no 'WOW' from these lips. This place is tiiiiny, but I actually have seen more cramped restaurants in NY before. It's cozy and very warm in the winter. Definitely make a reservation - the waiter was turning down people left and right as they asked if there were any tables available. Nope. Booked all night. We didn't have to wait at all, which was great, our table was ready and waiting for us. The waiter acts as a one-man-show and pretty much does everything but cook the food. He greets you at the door, sits you at your table, sets the tables and buses them, orders and brings out your food. Oh, and opens your wine for you. You guys know this place is BYOB, right? It's in bold in enough of these reviews! (And was really the reason we came here. Oh and for the raved about not-too-pricey food.) Very nice guy, a little crazy if you ask me, but really really nice and was doing pretty well for being the only guy there. He hiccuped a bit with our wine and dropped the cork inside, which lead to little floaters in every glass. No biggie right? When ordering - ORDER. I opened my mouth but didn't say the words and he was already gone and on to the next table before I could say 'Excuse me."" The food came out on time. We got the mushroom cigars as starters because of their RAVE reviews. They were very good - not what I expected at all! Definitely a go on those. I got the lamb and my boyfriend got the steak frites. The lamb was overcooked but pretty delicious. I'm not a fan of cabbage, which is the side that comes with the dish, but whatever sauce they doused it in definitely made it edible and I'd venture to say 'good.' The steak frites (even though so many people loved it) was not great. Sub par. The fries that came with - delicious. So really it was an OKAY meal. I would maybe come here again. But we've been to other BYOBs that have proved to be twice the service of Nook with a lot more care put into their work i.e. the owner/cook coming out to talk to his guests (see La Sirene: yelp.com/biz/la-sirene-nâ€¦).

Ask him for suggestions if you have trouble deciding on the menu. He will most assuredly give you his enthusiastic (though not effusive) opinion. The mushroom cigar appetizer and beet salad were very well-executed, but the standout items were hands down the steak frites balsamic reduction and rosemary fries and thai lamb chops. The grilled salmon looked decent, but none of the fish entrees were notable. Stick with the red meat. And they will have it seared and rare if that's how you want it. Prices are rather reasonable, but It's cash only (there are two ATMs further south on 9th ave). It's also BYOB (there are 6 wine and liquor stores on the same side of the street).

We decided to look for a BYO place as we have slowly been amassing a nice lil wine collection. Well lemme tell you, BYO restaurants have a whole different tone and element to them that makes for a real fun dining experience. Â  Tips on how to enjoy The Nook to the max!! 1. Offer a glass to the owner of the restaurant. Its a great way to shmooze, get to know him and enjoy his true hospitality. Furthermore the owner of this restaurant is a super nice guy. 2. Make it a good bottle ($18.00+) here's why. You are only Â spending $18.00 on the bottle, no stupid restaurant 3x mark-up. So what the hell, make it good and enjoy every sip! 3. Offer your wine to the pp sitting on your left and right (and they will be sitting very closely to you!). They will likely return the favor and you'll just enjoy the meal all the more with some new found friends. 4. Dont bother bringing beer. Two reasons. First, this menu is meant to be drunk with a good Zin, Pinot, Burgundy, maybe a Cab. Second, beer just aint a social drink. When you get a beer you drink it. When you get a bottle of wine you talk about it and share it. 4. The lamb chops kick serious buttt 5. I had the skirt steak with rosemary fries and couldn't have been happier. We will certainly be back. The bottom line is that the experience at this restaurant is what carries the experience. The menu is real good bordering on great but its how the whole dining experience comes together via the BYO element that makes this the special find that it is. Enoy - Yelpers!!!!",1

I've never been for dinner, but I'm sure it is just as wonderful. It's a small place though, so plan ahead.",1

Â My boyfriend ordered that Steak Frites and I had the Rack of Lamb - both were outstanding. Â The sever - who I assume was the owner/manager - didn't serve with the greatest ability but his enthusiasm and humor made up for it - and of course the fact that the food was so yummy.

3170,7,3,7/23/2008,"Tiniest little ""nook"" ever, but deliciously simple food. A friend told me about this place and we were lucky enough to get a last minute (prime time Sunday) seating for 3. I had the spinach, tomato and goat cheese scramble. It came with lightly fried home fries and mixed greens. My friend got the potato pancakes with smoked sausages. The sausages were delicious (nice smokey flavor that lingered on your tongue yet was not too overpowering). The potato pancakes were way too meaty tasting. Maybe it would have tasted better with the salmon option (will probably not bother to find out though). My friend got the eggs benedict but the poached egg was overdone. What's the point of getting a poached egg sans runny goodness? (I'd watch out for that). Overall, I enjoyed my entree plenty. It was light, fluffy and the goat cheese was nice and tangy. Not a bad experience but I wouldn't do jumping jacks over this place.",1
3171,7,5,5/8/2008,"I laugh at those who complain that this place is too small.. Yes its small, we do live in NY. Â Yes its cramed, but arent most of the hidden treasures? Â You know its small when you look in the window from outside. If you are going to complain about how tight it is or having to scoot in when someone wants to get by, keep walking and dont come in. Nook is a neighboor hidden gem. The food is great, its BYOB so your bill is never ever expensive, and its just a cozy date spot or chill spot to go with a girl friend or coworker for lunch. Â I have never been dissapointed in going there. Â The one downfall, that I can say, is that in the winter, when its cold out, the place is tiny, so the draft can sometimes get ya if you are in a table that is right by the door.. but hey, again, its NYC for ya right?",1
3172,7,4,4/26/2008,"This is by far my favorite lunch spot in the neighborhood (if you like having romantic lunches with your co-workers) This is a small cozy little place with an awesome lunch special: half sandwich, soup and rosemary fries for about $10. Who knew I was a rosemary fry junky? My only complaint is that the bread can be a little tough. HUNGR HIPPO PICK: lunch special",1
3173,7,3,4/20/2008,I agree with most everyone on here. Brunch can get a little crazy (read: long waits) if you go during prime time or with more than a couple of people. Jenny - glad you got your side of eggs! My boyfriend asked for a side of eggs and the waiter said he wouldn't bring them because they weren't on the menu! The food was decent but no drinks on the menu. Apparently you can BYOB but we didn't know beforehand so we had to deal with our Saturday hangovers without the aid of a Bloody Mary. I GUESS there are worse things...but I can't think of any off the top of my head.,1
3174,7,3,4/20/2008,"nook is definitely small and therefore, can be a wait if you go at the wrong time. i think the food is good, esp. if you live in the neighborhood and want a quick fix, but i don't think its worth a special trip to hell's kitchen. the wait staff wasn't particularly friendly and tend to freak out if you stand in the doorway to even tell them you what your table size is (due to its small size) .. but what else are you going to do? agree that the rosemary fries are very good, but not worth a special trip to hell's kitchen.",1
3175,7,5,4/15/2008,"So it's cramped; whatever - in my experience, best eggs in Hell's kitchen. I had the scrambled pancakes with a side of scrambled eggs (the side of eggs wasn't on the menu but the waiter was really nice). My friends had the goat cheese scramble with spinach, and the vegetarian sandwich. Nothing but raves on the food. The coffee was fresh and refills were swift. Couldn't ask for more.",1
3176,7,5,4/13/2008,"Very pleasing brunch place. Â It had a cozy atmosphere, the waiter was very friendly ( I didn't feel he was just working us for a good tip), and the food was fantastic. Â We ordered pancakes, the veggie sandwich, and an omelet. Â Though different from each other and slightly different from what I was expecting, they were all outstanding. Â When we got the check, it blew my mind that I was getting such a high-quality breakfast in midtown for so cheap. Â  This being the case, it also surprised me how low the yelpers had rated it. Â YES, the tables are a little bit closer to one another than is usual for a small cafe. Â YES, i could see it getting a little noisy. Â Get over it you claustrophobic Â anti-social dickholes, this place is great. Â In summary: *Fantastic food *Friendly service *Cheap *A little cramped *A little noisy Definitely going back again.",1
3177,7,1,4/10/2008,"Nook. Great place for 9th Avenue, but poor interpersonal skills and service. It is as if you the customer have to pay for the fact that it is a small intimate place. They were sticklers for reservation, but seated us 1/2 hour late. It was busy, so the server/host talked to us like she was too busy for us. The toughest part of my experience is that under entrees, they have listed a peppered tuna with mixed greens and when we received the dish it was small ""twice the size of a linguini"" slices of cold tuna steak. When we asked her about the dish, she spoke rudely that if we ordered a salad, that that is what we got. Her body language and attitude was not accommodating at all. I told her that if it was a salad, it should have been listed under salad. Well, I ordered something else and as I was eating, she returned to argue with me about the dish. I asked that I didn't want to discuss the issue further, but she persisted. Â I couldn't believe this was even happening. So, I will never return to this place and neither will any of my friends. We were a Â table of 6 whose experience was dampened by this server's attitude and demeanor.",1
3178,7,3,4/2/2008,"Tiny nook, friendly and a overall great place. Â A few drawbacks, cash only, and BYOB. Â It looks like a date spot but I wouldn't recommend it as it gets really noisy in there. Â The Rosemary infused french fries are disturbingly addictive and I'd recommend the hot chocolate made with callbert.",1
3179,7,2,2/29/2008,"Nook gets a solid 5 for the food, especially given how not expensive it is. So, how does a restaurant get only a 2-star rating with 5-star food? Simply put, they crowd the tables in so tightly that your meal is interrupted a dozen times to shift yourself and your table so other diners can get in or out of their seats. The crowding also means it's very loud, nearly impossible to have a conversation. I can't imagine Nook as a date spot, unless you and your date really enjoy not talking to each other and dragging tables around. If you're really lucky, you can get the table that gets hit by the front door every time anyone enters or exits the restaurant.",1
3180,7,5,2/23/2008,"I LOVE THIS PLACE ~ LUV IT!!!!! Â Everything on the menu taste fantastic. Â The place, staff, food, patrons are friendly, unpretencious, all local there to enjoy the great food. Â Yes, the place is tiny (really tiny). Â and Yes, other than off time, it is always busy and service can be slow as usally there is only one staff at the front. Â But really, would you want to go to a place that's NOT busy at prime time? Â This place is great for brunch, good price and unbelievable eggs! Â I highly recommanded. Â For brunch, go around 1ish... or call a head to get an idea of the wait.. Â :)",1
3181,7,5,2/16/2008,"Nook is about the greatest little Italian restuarant I have ever been to. The mushroom truffle eggrolls are to die for. All the entrees were delicious, I personally had the ribs. This is one of the few restaurants where I would recommend nearly everything on the menu. Insider tips: It is BYOB and has a capacity of about 20 people so go during a down time.........like......oh 10pm?",1

3183,7,4,12/9/2007,"This is Manhattan, after all. Â No matter where you turn, walk, stand, sit, or spit, there are thousands of others around you. Â One wonders how any of us keep our wits about in such madness. Â Speaking from the point of view of lowly tourist, I'd say the best way to stay sane is to find little nooks, like Nook, where you can have a pleasant conversation over some pleasant, yummy food. I came for breakfast with one local and two other Manhattan visitors. Â  Together we had: Mocha-chinos Baguette with cheese and organic jam (on appetizer menu) Egg Scramble (cheese, tomato, bacon, chives) Eggs Benedict Potato Pancakes Yes, Nook is ubber-small. Yeah, there is a solitary man taking care of all customers. But the food was beyond good. Â I loved the baguette with cheese and jam appetizer; it sounded like a curious combination but it arrived beautifully plated and was easily devoured by all. Â My scramble was great, the potato pancakes on par, and the Benedict good. Â  Overall everyone was pleased with the experience at Nook. Â Just mind your neighbors and come with the time to sit and enjoy. Â If you're in a hurry, as so many Manhattanites seem to be, consider some place else for the time being.",1
3184,7,1,11/15/2007,"Wow what a disappointment! The only thing good here is the mushroom truffle appetizer (which earned it this lone star) and the BYOB. Â  There's one waittress so I understand if things are slow. But the food took FOREVER to come out!!! Not only that - it sucked!! I got the lamb chops - which tasted exactly like roast pork from chinatown!!! It didnt even taste like lamb!! My friend got the steak frites - which came out overcooked and even BURNT!!! Also had NO flavor. Â  This place is tiny as hell and you can barely fit into your seat - and good luck trying to sit down in the bathroom! Which, btw you have to walk thru the KITCHEN to get to!",1
3185,7,5,10/12/2007,"Listen if you are a local go here. Who cares about the lack of service and the small room, the food is descent. The lack of service is still nice service. And bring all the wine you want and no corkage fee. That sounds good to me. Get the provencal salad. Its the best!",1
3186,7,3,8/2/2007,"Good neighborhood date spot. Very cozy (aka tiny), but that's a good thing :). Â Tuna Tartar appetizer was excellent. We ordered the Steak Frites & the Burger for our entrees-- both were good, not spectacular but good nonetheless. Couldn't get enough of the rosemary frites sidedish. Â Friendly service. Will try the Mushroom Cigars next time. FYI: cash only & BYOB so prepare beforehand!!",1
3187,7,3,6/13/2007,"Go here if you like the feeling of being ignored. A friend and I got together for dinner and he took me to Nook. Despite the fact that it was late and that there were at least two tables available, the hostess did not seat us for at least fifteen minutes. Several times, she looked right at us, hovering in the doorway, obviously hungry (could she not tell I'd been on an eight hour flight that day?), but she did not acknowledge our presence--she was busy pouring wine for two friends seated in the back, herself and the bus boy. If I had a fetish for being ignored, this place would turn me on. The food was quite good, especially the lamb--very tender and juicy--and fun to nibble off the bone. The scallops were flavorless but had a great texture and sauce, otherwise perfect for a light dinner. Also, believe what you read about the room being tiny. Go here if you like cozying up to strangers and overhearing first dates, unhappy marriages, and everything else you'd rather be missing.",1
3188,7,4,5/8/2007,"Small, cozy place -- a great place to turn the flirt on with a date. Its a BYOB kinda place, so make a detour to Trader Joe's for some Two-Buck Chuck beforehand.

3191,7,4,1/21/2007,"Its amazing how easy it is to walk past this place without even noticing its there. On the inside too it is strictly elbow room only... all of that gives the restaurant a certain charm though. I thought the food was quite strong. The mushroom cigar appetizers in particular were delicious. Some of the main courses werent as sharp. The service could use a little work as well, given that there really are never too many patrons there and the waitress seems pretty disinterested in them most of the time.. Oh very important - this place is a BYO! The dont serve liquor but you are welcome to bring a bottle of wine... Regardless if youre looking for a quiet and reasonable restaurant American meal around this part of town with friends or on a date, I dont know of too much else out there...",1
3192,7,4,11/7/2006,"Definitely not a place for a group dinner -- Nook has only a small number of tables, but is very comfortable. Granted, there were only about 4-5 tables seated - when the place is full, it might be a little overwhelming. We ordered the mushroom cigars (crisp shell & very flavorful, woodsy mushrooms) and the tuna tartar (good quality tuna). I had the scallops, my Â companion had the steak frite. The scallops were tender; cooked just enough served with greens and balsamic vinegar. From what I was told, the steak was decent, but the fries were fairly overdone. We had the chocolate mousse for dessert -- very good, if not a little dense. Oddly, it was served wish a dollop of strawberry sauce. Overall, we had a very good meal, and I would recommend giving it a try.",1
3193,7,3,5/26/2006,"This tiny, dark, 8-table, BYOB eatery delivered pretty good food at great prices. Â And even when the place completely filled up at 8:30, the service from the lone waiter was solid: attentive, friendly, and knowledgable. For appetizers, the mushroom cigars (pureed wild mushrooms rolled in a flaky phyllo crust and sprinkled with truffle oil, served with a truffled vinaigrette arugula salad) were awesome. Â The beet salad was good, the crab cakes decent, but the tuna tartare was too sweet, a little too warm, and didn't taste fresh. Â We ordered the filet, Nook garden pasta, and Tuscan chicken for our main dishes, and the only one I enjoyed was the Tuscan chicken (spinach- and cheese-stuffed chicken breast in a parmesan sauce). Â The sauce and the doneness of the filet were great, but the quality wasn't...and the pasta (penne with eggplant and zucchini in an alfredo sauce) wasn't bad, but it was nothing special. Â The sides were quite good: red wine braised cabbage and the sauteed spinach.",1
3194,7,4,3/15/2006,"The dining room is teensy, and there' s only one guy working the room. Although he was a bit overwhelmed, he was super nice and as attentive as possible. I came for brunch, and the food came in manageable portions: a few bites of home fries, a bit of salad, two eggs Florentine. The yolks of the eggs were poached just right, a little runny, but not so runny that they were intruding on my home fries. This is a sweet little spot. The food is very good, but not out of this world. I think some people would really go for the cozy atmosphere, but keep in mind that cozy can also be another word for cramped.",1

Try the tuna tartar and definitely the mushroom cigars.",1

When I called back to notify them that my order was incomplete they assured me that they would return with my complete order. They did return.

3198,8,1,1/31/2014,"I am a big fan of South American cuisine. To me the Pio Pio has an excellent Peruvian selection, accompany by flavorful sauces and fantastic rotisserie. So when I tried Pio Pio Riko in Chelsea I expected the same quality of food and I was severely disappointed. The chicken was dry to the bone, the amazing green sauce I love so much, Ahi Verde, was white and thick and tasted like paper towel. The beans were watery, very salty, flavorless, and the service, especially delivery, was just awful. I ordered over the phone, in Spanish, since it seems to be easier, and even after I repeated the order twice, I was delivered the wrong thing. Moreover, the delivery boy, Oscar I think his name was, was very inappropriate. Not only was he asking me questions like how much money I make and if I'm married, he smelled of something terrible. My friend, who was accepting the order with me, stated it may have been the smell of marijuana. In any event, this experience did not dampen my love for Peruvian food, but I will definitely stick to the original Pio Pio and stay away from this knock off.",-1

Â They cook up new chicken every few hours so it's really just luck whether you get the most fresh chicken or not. Â As I said most of the time it's very fresh and tender. The atmosphere is more suited for a casual lunch nothing fancy. Â It's low-priced so you get a good meal at a great price.",-1

The first time they didn't get the order right and I ordered a mild spice, and it tasted good but left a very fishy taste in my mouth afterwards. I decided to try it again and the waitress was friendly, attractive and attentive and the mussels were huge. I ordered it spicy so maybe that helped in it not being fishy. I'm looking forward to trying more of their exotic dishes.",-1

It was tender, juicy, and flavorful and I was honestly taken aback by this delightful combination. The rice and beans were good as well but I was more focused on the chicken. Â  The portions here are large; you can split your meal in half and save it for the next day. Customer service is good and the price is right. $6.50 for lunch in Manhattan and no attitude... rare commodity.",-1

3233,8,3,10/25/2014,"Although the ceviche limeno was very good with authentic flavors, the Lomo Saltado was dismal. Â The meat was tough, the tomatoes cooked too long (not visible on plate!), not juicy at all, not made with soy sauce. Â They just need to work on it (a lot). Â Service was OK. Â The place is a bit noisy and above a subway line so you rumble a bit",1
3234,8,5,10/23/2014,"The roast chicken was easily as good as we've ever had. The sides were fantastic, and the prices were excellent.",1
3235,8,3,10/23/2014,"I had a hankering for Peruvian food, which I hadn't had since I was actually in Peru almost a year ago. So I convinced my coworkers to go to Pio Pio Riko with me. Right off the bat, everyone who works here is friendly. They'll go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need (even pouring your sodas for you). The menu had a lot of Peruvian favorites, including rotisserie chicken, lomo saltado, ceviche, seafood and rice, and salchipapas. We started out with the salchipapas (fries with hot dog slices). Portion sizes were big and the fries were hot, but not very crispy. For my main, I went with the picante de mariscos (mixed seafood in ""spicy"" Peruvian sauce). I put ""spicy"" in quotes because it wasn't very spicy (the waitress even asked if I wanted spicy or not spicy, and I definitely said spicy). That said, the seafood was plentiful - crab legs, shrimp, mussels, and squids. The rice came on the side, which I wasn't a fan of; I expected the seafood to be over rice. It was also white rice, which is lame. I also had a 1/4 chicken because I just had to try it. The breast was pretty dry, but the wing was nicely burnt to a crisp and juicy. Glad I didn't go for the whole chicken meal. All in all, it's worth visiting Pio Pio Riko for no other reason than Midtown West sucks for lunch. Prices are reasonable (especially for the portion sizes). Service is quick. Food is okay.",1
3236,8,5,10/18/2014,"It took them a while to get our food ready but it's soooo delicious!!!!! It's a bit tiny, but the waitress was extremely nice.",1
3237,8,5,10/7/2014,"This place was a gem. After a long day of traveling from California and all by myself, I needed to feel closer to home and this place did it. I'm Peruvian and love the food. I ordered my two old time favorites, papa a la huancaina and lomo saltado. Very tasty and didn't disappoint. An inca cola is the best drink to wash it all down with. The place was small and simple but still quaint. Service was good and music was awesome if you like salsa and cumbia. They played some oldies and goodies. Thanks for the great visit and starting out my NYC trip.",1
3238,8,1,9/30/2014,"The SEA FOOD PAELLA was very meaty/fishy and the CHICKEN TAMALE was totally bland! Decor: This is a very small restaurant situated on 30th and 8th with an extremely simple decor. The restaurant can barely accommodate 15 people. FOOD: ARROZ CON MARISCOS- I saw some pictures on Yelp and the sea food rice/ paella looked great. However, I was totally disappointed with this dish. It's some kind of fried rice that contains vegetables, mussels, crab, shrimp and squid and is served on a bed of lime juice with raw onions. The taste of the paella was bitter and from the first bite itself it was extremely meaty and fishy. Especially the mussels were very fishy. I don't know if paella tastes like this everywhere but it is totally my opinion about this dish that is served here. In one line- I didn't like it at all. CHICKEN TAMALE- This item is wrapped in steamed banana leaf and is served with raw onions. This dish was very bland and tasteless. I'm saying this again because I like spicy food. I don't know if tamale tastes like this, never had it before. We also had some Peruvian drink. It was a refreshing beverage that was wine colored, tasted like lemonade with a hint of ginger. Liked it! It was different that regular lemonade. SERVICE: The lady/waitress is super cute and friendly. She single handedly manages to take orders, serve the food, cleans tables, takes away the dishes, gives you the bill....like a super woman. Five stars for her service. I didn't like the food but I topped her well Â and she deserves it. PRICE: Our total for these 3 items were $29 without taxes.",1
3239,8,5,9/30/2014,"The complimentary little cup of fried corn before my meal threw me for a loop. Virgin territory for me. Taste was similar to the unpopped kernels in a bag of popcorn. Very interesting... I think I liked it. Ordered the fried rice with beef. It was too good and waaayyy too much food for one person. The beef was actual slices of tender, tasty steak. Rice was cooked to a nice, toasty brown, Â well seasoned and filled with all my favorite fried rice goodies-scallions, scrambled egg, onions. No need for duck sauce or soy sauce at Pio Pio Riko although I did drizzle the cup of creamy cilantro sauce all over my rice. No shade but I'm starting to feel like other cultures do fried rice better than the originators. I regret that being in a bit of a rush, I was unable to order a more complete meal. Restaurant is small but in a comfortable way. Servers are very kind. I'll definitely be back when I have more time to really get down on some Peruvian cuisine.",1
3240,8,5,9/29/2014,"What a gem! I had dinner here for $10 including tax and tip. I ordered the 1/4 rotisserie chicken and subbed plantains for the fries. It also came with a salad. The chicken was so juicy and the skin was perfectly crispy. The salad was great - all romaine, no iceberg - and the plantains were amazing. My friend had Peruvian chicken mixed with fries and her chicken was possibly better than the rotisserie - perfectly succulent, to say the least. I will be back. Edit: came back and this time had the breaded fried chicken with rice and beans. So good, though if you're only visiting once I would recommend the chickens I talked about above.",1
3241,8,1,9/22/2014,Went here on a date and my date didn't like her dish after a bite and they couldn't void that dish off the bill. The way they went about it was wrong. It just didn't make sense to me cause it's more money in your pocket at the end of the day. Plus I hardly seen the waitress,1
3242,8,4,9/21/2014,"We found this restaurant after leaving Penn Station and having a a couple of hours to kill before getting a bus upstate. We were lugging lots of heavy suitcases. The staff was gracious and let us store our luggage near the register. The staff was friendly and service super fast and the food was delicious! Juicy flavorful rotisserie chicken that melts in your mouth! You can order a quarter or 1/2 chicken. We also tried the Civichee which was great and the beef Saltado which they said is a favorite on the menu. It is a beef dish with onions, and Â tomatoes served over fries and with rice. A ton of carbs but tasty. The restaurant is small and I'm sure locals just order take out, but the atmosphere was nice and place was clean. A pleasant surprise! Will definitely go back .",1
3243,8,4,9/15/2014,"This review is late- so forgive me if I'm not as accurate as usual. Â Bf and I came here for a late lunch right before we headed to Penn Station to get on a train. Â Since we were heading to the airport, they kindly let us store our luggage in the front near the hostess stand. Â Otherwise, the service was fine- quick and standard. We had one of the combination meals that gave us a whole chicken (or maybe it was half? Anyway they have all the sides), a side of tostones (which I asked for instead of fries and sausages), avocado salad, and rice and beans. If you're familiar with the Pio Pio chicken, you'll find the food and setup VERY similar. Â Here's how it all stacks up: - The chicken - actually less fattening than Pio's and as a result, less rich tasting and tad less tasty in my opinion. Still, flavorful and well roasted. Â The green sauce for the chicken was also less thick and had more garlic. Â The tostones were very good and had a nice garlic sauce which tasted the same as Pio's. Â The avocado salad was more of a salad with lettuce, and had less avocado than Pios. I prefer Pio's. Â  Riko is slightly cheaper than Pio, which is an advantage. Â I recommend checking it out if in the area and in the mood for tasty Peruvian comfort food.",1
2801,8,3,9/10/2014,"Pretty decent Peruvian fare. Â I had pork tamales to start, which were decent but the wrap got all over the tamale which made it hard to eat. Â The lomo saltado was decent as well. Â The place offered decent food and decent prices; everything just seemed a bit dirty and sticky.",1
3244,8,2,9/3/2014,"Nothing wrong with the food. It's great but what is not is the waiters. The waiter constantly changed. Me and my coworker got our credit card stolen and used from this place. How I know? This was the only place we went to together and it takes 10 minutes for them to swipe my credit card. With the constant change in waiters, something gotta be wrong here.",1
3245,8,3,8/21/2014,"We walked in because we though it was Pio Pio. We read ""Pio Pio Riko"" and immediately assumed that it was part of the Pio Pio chain. To our dismay though, it was not part of the Pio Pio chain. Â But rest assured, it is good- Not Pio Pio good but good. They are mostly known for their baked chicken. The chicken is moist and falls right off the bone. During lunch and dinner, you can get their awesome quarter-chicken and half-chicken deals. With it, you can get a combo of fries, sweet plantains, rice and beans, or salad. Their green sauce, though, they are sparing with, and will not give it to you unless you specifically ask for it. The green sauce is too liquid-ey, but it does the trick. It's a hole-in-the-wall restaurant. Its unimpressive storefront leads you right into a small restaurant with a handful of tables and chairs. You'll most likely find an occasional group of businessmen in button-ups and ties, a group of construction workers, and maybe a few students. I would not recommend dining in, but luckily, they have free delivery so call in your order! Â  Pio Pio Riko is more comparable to those quick eat-n-go joints such as Tina's Cuban Cuisine, Sophie's Cuban Cuisine, and Senor Pollo. If you live or work inconveniently too far from any of the aforementioned locations, Pio Pio Riko is a quick place to get your fix.",1
3246,8,4,8/13/2014,"Less than 1/2 a mile from my work place, I decided to give this place a chance. Fellow helpers gave it 3.5 stars but I was hopeful. I love eating Peruvian food and because of this I am always on the hunt for the best Peruvian restaurants. After walking into this seemingly narrow restaurant, we were seated all the way in the back. This restaurant makes you feel a bit claustrophobic as you have another table ten inches to your left or right. So then you might be wondering why it is that I am giving pio pio riko 4 stars. The answer is rather a simple one-- the food and service is superb. Typically at a Peruvian restaurant (from my experience) you receive mediocre service. However, at pio pio riko it's a different story. My coworker and I decided to split a 1/2 chicken, rice and beans, fried sweet plantain, and avocado salad. This was plenty of food for us to share. Of the four dishes ordered the more disappointing were the avocado salad and the beans. The avocado salad was very basic-- for the price of $7 I only felt like I was paying for the avocado. The beans weren't as flavorful as I'd expected and failed to compliment the rice. On the other hand, the chicken and the fried sweet plantains were perfect. The chicken was ridiculously moist resulting in the perfect bite, every time. The fried sweet plantains (I normally do not like the sweet plantains) were the best I've ever had. Eat them with the house green sauce for the perfect marriage of sweet and spicy. My experience at pio pio riko was so great that I left more than willing to face the lunch rush hour of the ever so hectic fashion district. Hands down the best Peruvian restaurant I have been to!",1
3247,8,4,7/26/2014,"Affordable Peruvian cuisine with more than generous portions. I was very impressed with Pio Pio Riko. I ordered the roasted chicken and some plantains, while my friends ordered one of the dinner for two offerings which boasted a serious amount of food for the money. I had to help them out there was so much food to be eaten, not that I minded. Pio Pio Riko is a great place for hearty, zesty cuisine in the heart of Manhattan. I will definitely come back since the food is tasty and the price is right.",1
3248,8,4,6/25/2014,Looking for a place to eat before dance class I found this place. Â The rotisserie chicken was delicious. Â Priced reasonably with good options on menu. Â Will come back soon.,1
3249,8,4,6/21/2014,"Went here with my best friend on our way to New Jersey for an Anime Convention via Penn Station. Before hopping on that NJ Transit we decided to grab lunch here. (I looked up on yelp beforehand places to eat around Penn Station). When we walked in we were greeted by the friendly and oh so beautiful waiting staff. It wasn't too busy around 5:30pm on a Thursday, there were two couples dining here at the time. Both appeared to be Hispanic, so I knew this spot had to be legit. Soccer played on the TV while Spanish music played on the radio. I was digging the atmosphere. They don't have a lot of space to use, and they made it work. Our lovely waitress explained the days special and took our drink orders. Inca Kola all day! Anyone who grew up in the hood knows what the business is. 30g of sugar a serving type of stuff. That super sweet, super bad for you, super yellow kind of soda. My buddy got the Pollo Saltado, and I got the Lomo Saltado. Beef (or chicken, respectively) stir fried with onions, tomatoes, and french fries served with a side of white rice. It didn't take too long to come out. Portions seemed just right, not too big, not too small. The beef for my Lomo Saltado was honestly a little dry and tough. But this dish itself was very flavorful, the onions still had a crunch without a harsh onion taste, and the tomatoes were great not soggy or anything. The fries still had a crisp to them which blew my mind, because it still absorbed a lot of the juices from the dish! White rice is the great equalizer, giving you something to mellow out your tastebuds when your dish is exploding with flavor. Every ingredient was well represented and worked in harmony. My only complaint was the beef, which should be the star of a dish like this. So all in all, I'm giving the Lomo Saltado a 3 and a half. My best friends Pollo Saltado, well... I never asked him about it, but he ordered ANOTHER ONE to go. So I guess it was good XD. I also ordered the half rotisserie chicken with rice and beans to go. So let me touch on that for a bit... My hotel in New Jersey didn't have a microwave so I ate it cold. BUT I still REALLY liked it. I can't speak on how it would taste fresh since I ate it like 3 hours later, so I won't give it a rating, just know that it's very flavorful, plentiful, and that green sauce is MONEY. Couple of comments based on other reviews: Seems they have a bathroom up and running for customers now, its very close. The only weird thing is the sink is outside of the bathroom. And the WATER situation seems to have improved. Previously, many customers complained about the place only serving bottled water. Well, when we ordered water we got, presumably tap water free of charge. I really wish I got to try more dishes before I wrote a review, but I couldn't contain myself. This is a really nice spot to eat, conveniently located outside of penn station. The rotisserie chicken is a great value and the staff is wonderful. I know I'll be back soon.",1
3250,8,1,6/20/2014,"Sat there for 45 minutes, they kept telling us it was almost ready, and then said it would be an hour more. We just left.",1
3251,8,4,6/15/2014,"Sweet eatery, inexpensive food and the staff is friendly. Â If you are looking for good and inexpensive meal, large portions and reasonably good food, this is your place.

Â Otherwise, thank you for a great meal and generous portions. Â The green sauce was a delight, I wish I could know how to make it.",1

The only reason this gets 4 and not 5 is the price point is a little high, especially for a place without a liquor license. That being said it is NYC and it is in a good location. If there was a 4.5 it would get it. Def would return and recommend to friends.",1

3258,8,3,5/13/2014,Probably our cheapest meal in NYC. We came here from the High Line and to escape the impending storm. We ordered the ceviche and chicken combo order. The beans were surprisingly good. The chicken was a little dry. Fries were crispy. Place is convenient and friendly.,1
3259,8,4,4/27/2014,Fresh succulent chicken with amazing house green spicy sauce. Â 1/2 chicken was huge and came with a side salad and beans for $8.50. Â The waiters and hostess (smoking hot) were very friendly and accommodating for our large group. Â They offer a complimentary Peruvian national drink when you sit down - it was very unique and I ordered a larger serving. Â Fried plantains were average but the chicken was so damn tasty I can overlook that. Â Pollo for life!,1
3260,8,4,4/27/2014,"I was craving South America food after coming back from a trip there. Really delicious rotisserie chicken. I've had the bistro a la pobre, rotisserie chicken, ceviche mixed, and the fried plantains. The ceviche was good but I've definitely had better ceviche in South America so I guess I have higher standards. The rotisserie chicken is tender and nicely seasoned and the ceviche was good but not he best I've had. The plantains were not as soft and sweet as I usually like but I guess I can deal with that. Overall a great meal for the price.",1

3264,8,3,3/27/2014,"Half chicken pio, rice, beans combo platter for $8.50 - boom! Had a quick dinner here a few nights ago while waiting for my gal to get in on the LIRR. Checked the Yelp ap for something edible in this part of town as I had an hour to kill. Found this on 8th Ave right across the back entrance of Penn Station. Now, there are a bunch of these Peruvian chicken spots dotted all around the city, but I always compare them to the Pio Pio that is on 1st Ave in my backyard up in Yorkville as the food, chicken, and the green crack sauce there is always solid. That being said the combo platter I had here was decent, but not on the same level as my Pio Pio. Chicken was ok, maybe a bit dry, and not full of flavor. Rice was good, as were the beans, but were a bit too soupy. The killer was that the green sauce was a total disappointment. It was way too watery and lacked any spice to it. I guess for a $10 meal with a soda it was good enough to get by. Service was ok. Place seemed clean. Kind of a sketchy crowd in here the night I arrived but I guess it's because of the part of town it's in. Overall, pretty par on course with what else this area near the train station offers, and not a horrible choice if looking to avoid Penn Station food.",1

Chicken was grilled tender - really tasty and the homemade green sauce it came with was delicious. I also ordered the fried sweet plantains as a side and for $3 they give you a big portion. It was ok - dry and not as sweet - wasn't really what I expected and I would skip this next time. Take out was friendly and quick. It took maybe all of 5-8 minutes for my food to come out - ready to go. They have a great menu with options for ceviche and fried seafood that I'll have to be back try. All the entrees are priced well with most ranging between $12-18.,1

The soup itself is major yum and always makes me feel better: warms you up and clears up the sinuses lol. Only dish I didn't like is the beef. Rather dry.

Â Also, the green sauce which is usually really wonderful with a nice spicy kick was also bland. Â When I asked the girl if they had a spicier green sauce like I have had in other places she stated that the green sauce is always like this. Â She is obviously not from Peru.

I highly recommend the half-chicken special ($8.50), which comes with an insane amount of food (lots of chicken, a big salad and french fries).

3273,8,3,2/20/2014,"Solid 3 stars. Here's the scoop. The price for 1/4 chicken combo is on point for lunch. The chicken is good but not the best Peruvian chicken I've had. It's a little under-seasoned. This is rectified by plenty of green sauce. If you want water don't bother they will give you bottled water and charge you. It's only a buck 75 and I'm not that cheap, but you should be told since it's not uncommon to ask for water in a NYC restaurant. I think it's a solid lunch option for the neighborhood as there isn't a plethora of options. But I don't think I'd go out of my way to come here. Service was fine. Looks like a hole in the wall outside but it's actually better on the inside than I'd expected.",1

Â I ordered the half chicken with rice and beans. Â All drinks, including water, were bottled. Â That's the only minor negative thing I have to say. Â The food came out quickly. Â The chicken was fantastically seasoned and the beans (pintos) and rice (plain white) went perfectly with it. Â The bill was extremely reasonable.

Â The food was standard fare - chicken and potatoes were fine and tasty, etc. Â I was upset that they didn't have the wonderful Peruvian soda - Inca Kola - which is a must for anyone trying Peruvian food! Â So, overall, I can't really knock the food as all, but I have definitely had better. Â Please try the chicken empanadas at one of their full-scale restaurants! Â The sauce that comes with them is just simply to die for and is for sure my favorite dish on the Pio Pio menu. Â They didn't have it on the menu at this location, which was a huge disappointment to me :( Overall, standard fare. Â I would give this three stars because it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't the best I've had out of my many Pio Pio experiences. Â Like I said - definitely go to one of the more ""full-packed"" restaurant to get the full experience of Peruvian food; however, if you don't plan on it, stop by here and grab a bite to eat as well.",1
3281,8,5,1/10/2014,"FIRST TIME HAVING PERUVIAN FOOD. Super delicious and delivery only took a little over 30 minutes. Had it delivered to our hotel. You don't need to pay a surcharge for delivery, just have to make sure your order is over $7 and to add tip. The tip was $1 included I guess, but I think there was something wrong with yelp. I wanted to add more, but couldn't change the ""$1.00"". Ordered arroz de marisco which is seafood over white or yellow rice (chose yellow), boyfriend says its SO good! He tends to complain about how every meal he ever gets never has enough seafood. Except this dish has every seafood he likes, cooked perfectly, and has just the right amount of proportion to his rice. I ordered the 1/4 chicken meal with white rice and beans. This too was tasty. I kept stuffing my mouth bite after bite. For a side dish, we ordered tostones. It was okay, I wouldn't order it again. The other dishes and delivery service definitely made up for it, that we didn't even need the side dish.",1
3282,8,5,1/4/2014,"On a birthday weekend for my sister in NYC, one of her only requests was to try one of the many Peruvian restaurants that she has heard about from friends and family who are from the area or have visited the area. Thanks to Yelp, I found this place was only a 10 minute walk from our hotel, and the reviews looked good, so we went their for our final meal of the weekend - Sunday lunch! We were expecting full bellies and maybe a slightly different flavor from what we're used to in Toronto, but nothing could have prepared us for the foodgasm that was about to ensue! The 4 of us were immediately seated at a table right in the back corner, and the owner himself, Juan Carlos, took care of us for our entire visit. Once he realized that we know our Peruvian cuisine (my sister's SO is from Peru), he broke out his A-game and started making suggestions. Here is what we ate: Papa a la Huancaina - potatoes in a creamy, pleasantly spicy cream cheese sauce and garnished with hard boiled egg. We ended up with 2 orders of this and not a speck of sauce was left on either plate it was that good. Most places either make this too spicy or too bland, and this one was spot on. Pork Tamales - perfectly seasoned and moist cornmeal dough with pork wrapped in a banana leaf. It had a bit of a kick to it and was so much tastier than any other tamales I've ever tried from any country. Ceviche Mixto - sliced fish with shrimp, squid, octopus and red onion marinated in a very spicy lime juice. I have never, ever, ever enjoyed ceviche anywhere, but this was a game changer. The flavor was out of this world, and each piece of seafood was tender and seasoned perfectly. (I've actually been dreaming about this since I got home.) Bistec a lo Pobre - thin, tender steak served over fries with hot dog, plantain, rice, beans and a fried egg. Simple and delicious. The beans were creamy, the plantain wasn't soggy from oil or cooked to the point of being cardboard-like. A great meal to fuel a day wandering the big city, or to help with a hangover! Tacu Tacu (which is not on the menu) - a delicious rice dish with beans and seafood, including half of a crab. I've never had anything like it so I can't think of what it could be compared to. The portion was so large that 4 of us ate it and there were still leftovers that came in handy when we got stranded in the US due to the ice storm in TO. We ended the meal by sharing a dish of a tropic fruit helado - a tasty, only slightly sweet and almost palate cleansing ice cream. With every dish that Juan Carlos brought to our table, he waited to see our reaction once we tried it and took such pleasure in how much we enjoyed it. He shared with us that he oversees the preparation of each dish and it has to meet his approval before it can be served. I can't remember the last time that I met someone took so much pride in their food and was genuinely thrilled that we were beyond satisfied with our meals! In fact, this meal was so unbelievably good it has ruined all other Peruvian restaurants for all of us. We practically offered to adopt Juan Carlos and bring him to Toronto so we can have this food whenever we want. Actually, we'd be just as happy if he opened a Toronto location. The other thing that was so impressive was the value - the price was ridiculously affordable and would have easily cost 3x what we paid if we ordered similar in Toronto. As I mentioned before, the portions were huge and Juan Carlos carefully wrapped up the leftovers for us which kept us going when stranded somewhere between Newark and Philly. They don't have a liquor license yet, but in a way, I'm glad as I would not have wanted anything to alter how everything tasted to me. I can't recommend this place enough. It's walking distance from Penn Station and Port Authority if you're ever on a long layover and want to enjoy a meal, and not far from Macy's if you need to refuel after a day of shopping. The service is great and the food is the best value for your money that you'll find pretty much anywhere in that area. It took me a dozen visits to NYC to find a place like this, and now I want to return at least a dozen times just so I can eat here!",1
3283,8,3,12/29/2013,"Meeting up with ex-Seattle Yelper Eric K with the caveat of a restaurant favoring the West side proved a bit more difficult than I would have expected, which is how we came to settle on Pio Pio Riko, where the three of us ordered: * Maduros Fritos - It's hard to do fried plantains wrong, and, so, these were about as one would expect. Soft on the inside, slightly crispy on the outside, with the usual sweetness that you'd expect. * Ceviche de Pescado - Not the best I've had, but still enjoyable, and with generous portions too. * Rotisserie Chicken - This was the least stellar part of the meal. Tasty, still, but not nearly as good as other Peruvian rotisserie chicken preparations I've had, and definitely a lot drier than others I've tried. ***Accessibility Info*** Venue - Aside from being a smaller venue, Pio Pio is a NARROW venue, with tables packed very closely together. This not only makes getting down the length of the restaurant a bit difficult, it also makes squeezing into your seat a tad hard as well. Bathroom - Didn't try, so I can't say for sure.",1
3284,8,3,12/27/2013,"Authentic or not, the food is good and the portion is generous! Service was slow and waiter didn't give a damn. But for the price, I'll come back.",1

Â I ordered the combination plate with half chicken with fries and salad. Â I really did not like the salad but the fries and chicken was alright. Â It smelled amazing, but the taste was meh, I've experienced better. Overall, I would rate them a three star but they charged me $1.75 for a bottle of water when I wanted a glass of water. Â I didn't know water was not free in Manhattan, because I had my own bottle of water in my purse.",1
3287,8,2,12/26/2013,"I am not sure if this is the standard but when you ask for water, you are charged for bottle water. Â At most restaurants, you get tap or filter water or whatever. Â However here you get charged 1.75 for a bottle of water. Â I am not a big fan of bottle water since Â the industry is barely regulated and I don't know what is in my water. Â I also think they should inform their customer if they deffer from the industry standard. Â My water bottle was messed up on the bottom and barely stood up straight. I got half a chicken with two slides. Â The chicken was alright but was great. Â It was slightly dry. Â Well the wing part was totally dry and hard. Â I also got beans which were just beans. Â I got rice as well and well it was rice. Â Nothing really stood out. You also get a green sauce and some kind of snack. Â The sauce didn't really work with the meal. This place was pretty empty when I was here and I can see why. One of the employee was kicking an old man in the ass when I left. Â No idea what was going on. Â I assume it was some kind of a joke but not professional at all.",1

3290,8,4,12/21/2013,"In the city, it's hard to find a place that isn't trying to rush you out the door with a full belly, but at Pio Pio the friendly service and relaxing atmosphere made me lose track of time- almost. We came in and were promptly seated. The owner/manager came over to us and recommended a few dishes after we said it was our first time. He recommended Â us the seafood special, which he said was off menu- but delicious. His persistence won out and we ordered that with the half chicken. I expected the seafood was about to go bad, which was why he was so adamant about us ordering it, but it was delicious and flavored well. It came with mussels, half a spider crab, and shrimp- all in good amount served with dirty rice. Halfway through the meal i needed to use the restroom which was out of service- but the manager allowed me to use the one in the back for the kitchen (i assume). As i went to wash my hands and I found the door knob in the sink, whipping around to find of course- the handle missing. After the walls began to cave in for a bit- i realized I had my phone and called my friend whereupon i'm told the manager took one look at her confused face and jetted to the back to help me out. Funny story eh? The manager stayed friendly through the meal and even after as he led us to the door. Before we made our departure he waved his hand and made 3 business cards appear out of thin air- saying he also did real estate. Haha - funny guy. 4 stars for the food and 5 for the service.",1
3291,8,5,12/17/2013,"Legit. Small little spot, but cute inside & tastiest plates. Dishes range from $3-$14, also super legit. Everything there was delishhhh.

3292,8,2,12/15/2013,"I was very disappointed after trying this place given that other people's reviews were so high. The rice and beans had ZERO flavor what so ever. Even after using some of the left over juice from the ceviche and putting some of the green sauce in there it was still not exciting. The price was high. The tres leches was not soaked at all so more than half of the cake was completely dry- the opposite of how tres leches should be. Overall, I was very disappointed. Was hoping for good Peruvian food which is one of my favorite cuisines but it turned out to be lacking of flavor and quality.",1
3293,8,5,12/12/2013,"I can't believe I've only just now found this gem of a place near my apartment. Â I was a little skeptical after seeing only 1 other party in the restaurant and the ghetto lighting fixtures they had hanging from the non-working chandeliers, but hey, don't judge a book by it's cover, right? Prices are on point for chicken combos - 2 sides and a quarter of a chicken for $6.50 or a half chicken for $8.50. Â Portions are large as well - I ordered a half chicken and took half of it home. Â Green sauce is delicious and the homemade hot sauce adds the perfect amount of kick to your dish. Â Beans are hearty and rice is well cooked. Â The chicken is also well-cooked and flavorful - not too dry. I saw the mixed seafood ceviche for $14 had to have it. Though $14 seems like a steep price since my entree was basically half the price, it was totally worth it. Â Squid, shrimp, and raw fish galore - no food poisoning here. Â The simple spicy lemon marinade was to-die for. One thing I noticed that was exceptional and that I must point out was the level of customer service here. Â My dirty napkins were replaced, my water was always full, and someone came around to make sure I had enough green sauce. Â They constantly came around asking if we needed anything else and if we were doing okay. Â It's not everyday that you'll find this level of service around the City, and especially not at a $$$$ establishment.",1
3294,8,4,12/8/2013,So TASTY and SO MUCH FOOD for cheap. I went and had the pollo with rice and beans and tostados and then realized that I over ordered. The chicken was nicely cooked and delicious and the rice and beans were perfect. The tostados were also so yummy. I would come back.,1

3304,8,4,10/25/2013,"I'm so glad this place is right by Penn Station. Â I was beginning to think that it was hopeless to find a decent place to eat around there and that I had to eat at the chain restaurants or fast food places while I waited to catch the Megabus or watch a movie. It's a small restaurant, but the food was still good nonetheless. Â I was there with a few friends and we ordered their ceviche, rotisserie chicken, lomo saltado, and a side of plantains. Â It also came with side choices of salad or rice and beans. Â Since we had two entrees we got one of each side. Â Everything was also affordably priced, which was a great bonus. It isn't the best Peruvian food I've had, but for the price, portion, and location, I would definitely return when I am in the area. Side note: It just so happened that the time I dined there, one of the customers was being obnoxiously rude to one of the waitresses. Â English was not their native language and that customer was being a prick about wanting to change the channel on TV.

3306,8,4,10/12/2013,"3.5 stars Â - Decided to stop in a for a quick lunch date with my parents before dropping them off at the megabus stop (about 4 ave. blocks away). We arrived around 1PM on a Saturday. The hostess immediately greeted us and Â volunteered to help store my parents' luggage behind the counter so we can sit comfortably at our table. We were greeted by the owner soon after and were explained what the specials and recommendations were. He was a little pushy on the seafood and ceviche dishes even though we already told him we came here for the chicken. Nevertheless still a really friendly guy and checked on us multiple times. Aside from the whole chicken, we also wanted to get a few of the sides dishes. We saw the combo specials and noticed that it's actually cheaper if we order the salad and two sides separately. When asked about the avocado salad however, the owner informed us the avocado was out of season and the salad was not available.. boo. So in the end we ordered yuca fries + rice and beans to go with our chicken and went with the owner's recommendation (his insistence worked) Â of mixed seafood ceviche to share. The chicken and the sides dishes came out really quickly! The chicken was juicy and tender with the perfect amount of charred goodness. It paired so well with green and white sauces they gave us in separate cups. The pinto bean was delicious - well cooked and not overly seasoned or salty like most bean heavy cuisines. The yuca fries was a fail however - cold, stale, and undercooked. I took one bite and I said to myself - not worth the calories. The ceviche took a bit longer before it was served. I was already half way thru my chicken! The dish itself was very refreshing - a bit too sour/lemony for my fiance's taste. I thought it had a nice texture of everything combined with the nut/corn/sweet potato/all the seafood. Good but not memorable. Sardi's in Maryland and Limon in SF def do their Peruvian chicken and various dishes a bit better. Just fry the yuca fries a bit longer and make them crunchy please! Nothing else to complain about - food was quick and service was spot on. A very satisfying meal - my dad has a cold and did not have a bit of appetite - somehow cleared all the dishes.

The chicken was tender and packed with flavor, the rice and beans were good, the plantain were good, the salchipapas and fries were good....all was good.

3308,8,5,9/25/2013,"Loved the beef fried rice, and the rotisserie chicken and a special Peruvian spicy potato dish. Great, friendly service and pleasant unassuming atmosphere. Very convenient to Penn Station and our little dance school. We will be back.",1
3309,8,3,9/25/2013,"The staff was friendly. The space is a bit tight. Â Both facts were highlighted by the awkward moment when the owner turned on the bathroom light for me, and handed me a paper towel after I washed my hands in the bathroom sink right next to and open to the kitchen. Â  When you have a few hours to kill around Penn station, you quickly realize that there's a dearth of decent restaurants nearby. Â With a Yelp search of the area, I settled on Pio Pio Riko because I really like Peruvian food, especially the green aji sauce. Based on my Lomo Saltado order, food was pretty much on-par with most other Peruvian restaurants out there: Â decently priced, a generous portion. Â The aji sauce fell a little flat - high on mayonnaise, low on that special flavor.",1

3312,8,2,9/6/2013,"With Peruvian food it's all about the chicken for me. Â So of course, I ordered a quarter chicken meal that came with rice and beans. Â After a short wait by the cramped front area, my order came out missing utensils in the bag. Â The chicken was almost flavorless and the skin was not even browned. Â The rice and beans were watery, probably from whatever liquid the beans had been sitting in. Â It did come with a green sauce that's a bit spicy and I ended using all of it for my food because there wasn't much flavor elsewhere. Â The presentation was poor as well. Â Each container looked as if the food was sloppily thrown in there. Â  I stopped by this place out of convenience but I won't be stopping by here again even if it is a convenience.",1

Â Not quite sure what to expect when we ordered the jalea, I was beyond overjoyed when they brought out a huge dish, and mind you this was the small portion, of deep fried seafood goodness. Â The fried food wasn't the least bit oily and it was topped off with this ceviche style onion garnish that had me wishing I had a second stomach to order one of their ceviche dishes. Â The chicken was delicious and moist. Â Thinking about it again has me salivating. Â  Walking distance from Penn Station, it's easy to find, but with the hustle and bustle probably goes unnoticed. Â If you ever find yourself in the area looking for a not so light snack, this is definitely a place to stop by. Â To top it all off, the service is just as great as the food.",1

Came here on Tuesday nite - the place was empty. Quickly got seated by attentive wait staff who speaks perfect English with a charming accent. Saw that most food has authentic Peruvian names on the menu. My friend ordered avocado salad $6 while I went for ceviche mixto $14. We also got chicha morada, a traditional drink of purple potato juice with lime & pinch of cinnamon. The salad was fresh and clean. I was happy with the portion of my ceviche mixto and how spicy and acidic it was. While my heart was set on flan for dessert, we tried the recommended helado de lucuma $4.5 (""egg fruit"") and boy we weren't disappointed. It was delicious! While we waited for our bill, we saw our next tables configured into group setting, and a family brought a baby stroller and half dozen of corona beer on the table. We were told that it is BYOB(!!!!!) and $1 would be charged for such. From the time we were seated to getting our bill it was about an hour. Our bill ran up to low 30s. I feel compelled to mention how nice the service was. The wait staff was thoughtful enough to bring us extra plates so we could share our food. They made good recommendations on first timers and were polite and gracious. These two beautiful women wore smiles on their faces and were never rude nor rushing.

Honestly, I think I may have had Peruvian food once in my life, possibly twice. Anyway, the place is small, but cozy. It was later in the afternoon and it was still packed. We were quickly seated and given menus. The waitress gave us some recommendations and then gave us time to decide. So we decided on the papas a la huancaina, pescado frito, and lomo saltado. Originally I think we wanted to get tamales, but they already ran out by the time we got there. The waitress told us this and recommended the papas a la huancaina; it's like baked potato in this creamy cheese sauce with a boiled egg. I personally really liked the sauce, it was good! As for the pescado frito (fried fish), it was served with rice and tostones (plantains). I don't know what seasoning they put on the rice or fish, but it was sooo good! The lomo saltado was pretty good considering my friend practically finished his dish. They gave us complimentary dessert, flan! I liked it, but my friend thought it was too sweet. Overall, good food and great service, I will be back!",1

My friend and I both got the quarter chicken. She got white meat and I got dark, which I really don't prefer, but neither of us specified, so if you're picky I'd recommend telling your server. I got mine with rice and beans on the side, while my friend got fries and a salad. Hers looked like significantly more food, but I was full by the time I finished mine anyway.",1
3321,8,4,6/24/2013,"I am not an expert on Peruvian cuisine so I can't vouch for Pio's authenticity but I love their chicken. It's well seasoned with what seems like a paste marinade. I normally go for the quarter chicken with rice and beans which comes with a green (jalapeno ?) sauce. The green sauce is good but the white sauce is GREAT with the chicken so I get both. Also, they make a delicious tres leches cake if you are in the mood for dessert.",1
3322,8,3,6/23/2013,"Derricious! Restaurant is very clean and the waitstaff is extremely friendly. The half-chicken combo is such a steal! For $10, you get a LOT of food - half a chicken with rice and beans. Yum! Lomo Saltado is $15 - a little pricey, but well worth it. I don't recommend ordering this to go, because the fries will get soggy from the juices. Mmm.... and the green spicy sauce is soo good with the steak. Everything was tasty, and the experience was splendid, but it wasn't anything that I would crave for. It was a good place to grab a late night dinner :)",1

3324,8,3,5/27/2013,"This isn't the grimey fast take out type of Peruvian rotisserie that is so common among latin neighborhoods. This is a proper restaurant (of course they do offer take-out and delivery as well). The interior is clean and very classy and the service is decent as well. Prices are a little higher than hole-in-the-wall joints I've been to in areas like Bushwick or Woodside but that's understandable. I got half a rotisserie chicken and maduros (fried sweet plantains) for about $9. The chicken was well seasoned and was tender but was too dry for me to justify giving more than 3 stars. If you use the white or green sauces they give you with it then it would be plenty moist. The plantains were a little too oily for my liking but was overall worth it if you like maduros. Upon leaving I got a cookie ($2), it was a shortbread cookie sandwiched with caramel. The cookies were a little dry for my liking and the caramel was nice and soft but oddly didn't have too much caramel flavor. It was consistent with the meal in that I can say it was ok but I won't be rushing back when there are better places in the city.",1
3325,8,5,5/26/2013,"Delicious food, affordable prices, rumbling location (subway runs right beneath them) but the best is the most friendly service Â you could ever imagine you can get (without paying for it). You need to try them when near Penn Station.",1
3326,8,5,5/20/2013,"I have an obsession with Peruvian chicken and this fast food like joint delivers like no other... perfect for a quick, cheap and delicious lunch option in Manhattan. I walked in and was pleasantly surprised by its welcoming decor. I was going to do takeout but when I saw how cute it was inside, I decided to sit down for lunch instead. Â I went with the quarter chicken accompanied by rice and beans for a measly $6.50- what a bargain! Â Rotisserie white meat chicken in all of its glory, with their amazing green sauce on the side. I was in lunch heaven! Â  Service was attentive and speedy- aka perfection while on my break. The owner even stopped to make sure I was happy with my meal- classy touch for a take-out focused establishment. The waitress even cut me a sliver of their AMAZING tres leche cake on the house as she presented me my check. It was so so so good- up there with the best I've ever tried. My bill was literally like 8 something and I had ordered a drink as well. You really can't beat the quality of food, attentive service, and crazy cheap prices. I'm a fan forever - it's officially a top contender for my favorite lunch special in Manhattan.",1
3327,8,5,4/29/2013,"Oh my gosh. This place is fantastic. I got the quarter chicken with rice and beans, and I basically ate every single piece of it. I'm generally not a huge fan of chicken off the bone, but it was so highly reviewed, that I had to try it. For $7 and lightning fast service, it's pretty hard to beat.",1
3328,8,4,4/13/2013,"A pleasant surprise in the culinary wasteland that is the area surrounding Penn Station. I always get the quarter chicken with rice and beans. Chicken is always moist and tender, and rice and beans are always a nice accompaniment. And it's A LOT of food. All that food for $6.50(?), you can't go wrong. Oh, and if the yummy green sauce doesn't have enough kick for you, be sure to ask for the red spicy sauce. The kind of sauce that burns your insides. I pour both sauces all over both the chicken and the rice. Delish. The servers are sweet and do a good job despite how busy it gets during weekday lunch hour. If you dine in, you get a little slice of tres leches cake on the house. It's not amazing, but hey, it's free dessert.",1

3331,8,4,4/2/2013,"This was a really tasty and inexpensive place to grab dinner before going to a show at MSG. The waitresses were very friendly. I ordered half of a rotisserie chicken, rice and beans, and it was a lot of food, but I managed to clean my plate. We also ordered the veal heart as an appetizer without knowing what to expect, and that was a pleasant surprise. I noticed a table nearby with a pitcher of some purple-colored drink. It looked like sangria, but I don't think it was. When I asked the waitress if we could have some, she said that they were all out. Next time I go back I'll try again.",1
3332,8,3,3/30/2013,"Had the half-chicken lunch special with rice and beans. The chicken was fine, as you'd expect for rotisserie chicken - moist, tender, and with some good seasoning. However, the rice and beans were rather tasteless - I'm surprised there's nothing more to them. This place is fine for weekday lunch if you're in the local area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.",1
3333,8,3,3/27/2013,"3.5 stars This place gets real packed during lunchtime. Go for the take out, and call in ahead of time or else you'll be waiting there for at least 10 minutes, like this guy. I ordered the quarter chicken with a side of beans and salad, cause ain't nobody got time for extra carbs. When I took the carton of beans out of the bag, I was giddy at its weight. However, after scooping into the carton, I was very disappointed to find that it was 75% bean juice and only a measly amount of beans came up on my fork; I'd been duped. That said, the chicken and green sauce were very good, a tad too salty. Perhaps it was my fault for messing up the classic rice and beans combo.",1
3334,8,3,3/15/2013,"We ordered a few things off the menu here. The Peruvian chicken was pretty juicy, tender, and tasty. The yucca fries was nice and starchy but not much different than other Latino places. The Avocado Salad is exactly what you think of in the most simplest terms: slices of avocado on a bed of greens. Everything we ordered was alright, but I liked the chicken. Someone ordered what we suspect to be the Jaela and that looked really impressive. Might have to look into that sometime.",1
3335,8,3,3/15/2013,"Crowded during the lunch hour. Â I was very happy with the quality of the food for the price. Â We fed 3 ppl for under $25. Â We got the whole rotisserie chicken, avocado salad, tostones, and fried yucca. Â They brought us out some dried corn kernels with a dipping sauce as...iunno, as opposed to a bread basket, I guess. Â It wasn't that special. Â The standout for me was the tostones. Â Perfecto. Â The chicken was also very moist and tasty. Â The avocado salad still had ice bits in it and the fried yucca was skippable. Â  They asked us to move b/c there was a larger group, and after our meal, they brought out some flan on the house. Â The flan was delicious and had a wonderful creamy consistency. Â  We will come back if we're in the area. Â The special (seafood paella) sounded very good. Â The group next to us ordered some fried seafood tower that had my husband salivating...so we know what to order next time. Â Also, it's next to Pizza Suprema, which is supposed to be one of the top ten pizzas in NYC.",1
3336,8,4,3/8/2013,"You really can NEVER go wrong with Peruvian cuisine. Peruvian cuisine is probably the most diverse and the tastiest of all SOUTH America and there's certainly no doubt because I grew up there. Anyways, I have to say that I love this place!!! It's great to see these casual Peruvian eateries pop up because Pio Pio can get expensive and are mostly sit-down. Cashier Staff are friendly and their chicken and Seafood Jalea is just oh-so orgasmically good and not to mention their GREEN Aji Sauce YUM!!. Prices are decent and reasonable and wish this place was near where I work so that I can go there everyday!",1
3337,8,5,2/22/2013,"Definitely an undiscovered gem in NYC. The food was fast and delicious, just like the food I had in Peru. The service was great too. The inside is nicely decorated and very clean. Seriously check this place out! Ohh did I mention it's cheap too?",1
3338,8,5,2/21/2013,Amazing food!,1
3339,8,4,2/20/2013,"Finally! Some of flavors of Queens comes to Manhattan!. As other yelpers have stated this area of manhattan can be extremely difficult to get quality,affordable food.The only options were overpriced diners, fast food, god-awful tourist traps or extremely questionable delis(grade F or worse!!!) Thank goodness for PPR. I went for lunch and ordered the special 1/4 chicken with rice and beans. Chicken was cooked to perfection, nicely seasoned and juicy with crisp skin. The rice and beans were surprisingly good as well, made from scratch. The waitstaff is quite friendly, Â and efficient, although I did have to wait a while for my check. But overall a pleasant experience, glad to have this Peruvian addition in the area.",1
3340,8,5,2/19/2013,"I live around the corner from this place, and boy, am I glad I do. I've never eatten inside, but regularly get take out. The only thing I've tried from here are their roasted chicken combo meals for $26. I wouldn't recommend to stray from that as that's their specialty. It comes with rice & beans, plantains, salad, sausages. The roasted chicken is seasoned very well and cooked to perfection - very moist. Their rice and beans don't look great, but once you taste them you'll be pleasantly surprised. Their fried plaintains are large and delish. The salad comes with this green salad dressing which I'm not sure what it's made of, yet very good. Overall, I've never had a disappointing meal from this place. Best part is there's so much food you'll have leftovers for days to come!",1
3341,8,4,2/12/2013,This was a great Yelp find! I had the chicken and rice and my friend had the seafood paella Â .. Then they treated us to a great dessert. A sweet milk cake. The service was very friendly . We are happy that we came here .,1
3342,8,5,2/9/2013,This place is worth visiting. The chicken is phenomenal and the rice and beans are really good. There is a bean soup that was fantastic. If this place was only on seamless. I am a regular at this place now. The chicken is season really well. Check this place out. You won't regret it.,1
3343,8,4,1/22/2013,Great place for roasted chicken or seafood. Good soups as well. A great alternative to pub grub and the same old italian food at the rest of the places around the city.,1
3344,8,5,1/19/2013,"Peruvian chicken is one of my favorite splurges. My partner and I were really hungry and decided to chance a visit here, seeing the few but gleaming reviews Yelp offered. What a lovely surprise! The chicken was tender with crispy skin and wonderfully seasoned. Melt in your mouth, juicy chicken is my main reason for loving Peruvian chicken, and Pio Pio Riko nailed it. The red beans and rice on the side of my partner's half chicken were shockingly delicious, stewed with bay leaves and some over manna from heaven. The fries with my half chicken were very good, and the side salad was huge. I was completely satiated after this meal. I thought that a half chicken and red beans and rice was a steal for $8.50, and we were pleasantly surprised with a complimentary after dinner slice of Tres Leches cake which was to die for! Service was great, quality was top-notch, and price was outstanding. Definitely a gem in a bucket of overpriced rocks around Penn Station!",1
3345,8,5,1/15/2013,"I'm going 5 stars here, only because when you account for the dearth of lunch options in the area, a place like this is like an oasis in a 100 mile desert. Some may call it a knockoff of the more famous Pio Pio that we all know and love, but honestly, this place seems just as good. I've only been there once, and I stuck to the rather vanilla rotisserie chicken with rice and beans as sides. The chicken was cooked to perfection and the rice and beans were well above average, if not better. (It's not really about the rice and beans for me, so maybe my review lacks substance there. If that's what excites you, you've got problems). Of course the green sauce that accompanies most Peruvian chicken comes with the dish, and takes a good dish to great. A friend and I dined in for lunch, and the staff was a little laid back, but still good (we had to flag down a waitress and then waited a bit for our check. Not at all a big deal, unless you really are in a time pinch to get back to work). At 1pm on a weekday, we were seated immediately. But the place is still pretty new so I expect that won't last very long. The prices are dirt cheap compared to the quality of food ($6.50 for 1/4 chicken with 2 sides, $2 more for 1/2 chicken). I don't dine in that often in the area, but this place does takeout pretty efficiently as well, plus they deliver, so it's going into my regular rotation. Full disclosure, they DID give us dessert on the house, a delicious though obviously out of the freezer piece of tres leches cake. Does that bias my review? Not at all, the food is top notch. Would I travel from out of the area for it? It's hard to judge that considering I didn't try any of their entree options. As far as just the rotisserie chicken goes, it's typical Peruvian chicken, so it's not any more exciting than any of the other Peruvian spots scattered throughout the city. But if you work in this area, you've been waiting for options like this for a LONG time.",1
3346,8,5,1/12/2013,"Definitely one of the best ceviche I've had in the city, nonetheless, in Manhattan!!! Service was extremely fast. The staff was very polite and friendly. Â You definitely get what you paid for!! This place has become one of my favorite restaurants.",1
3347,8,5,1/10/2013,"Wow, first experience at PPR getting takeout was great! I can't figure out which sad sack dive it replaced as the Thai and sushi place are both still on the block, but this is a very welcome addition to what is a pretty poor excuse for a dining strip (think 9th Ave of Hell's Kitchen on budget cuts and meth). The place has been open about a month according to the girl at the welcome desk, but at lunchtime it was full, with local business cogs waiting for their carryout. I joined them after ordering a quarter chicken with rice and beans (best value at $6.50). The digs are very simple but will cover you for a lunchtime sit-down with a coworker. As for the food, five stars! Delicious rotisserie chicken, impressively spiced and full of Peruvian flavor. The rice and beans were unnaturally good as well, as was the ubiquitous Peruvian green sauce. A glance at their full menu revealed that actual Pervuain dishes abound, so if you're in the mood, you can get your ceviche, anticuchos, and lomo saltado on. Si se puede! Hopefully this is the beginning of a culinary turnaround for Garment District South.",1
3348,8,4,1/10/2013,"This replaced a very mediocre Thai place, so I'm happy for the new addition to the Penn Station-ish food options. Since I work around here, I've only been here for lunch. The waitresses were courteous and friendly, as well as quick and efficient. The free corn and 'chutney' (for lack of a better descriptor) was quite yummy. I had the quarter rotisserie with rice and beans, and it was nice enough. Personally, I would've liked it cooked a little more, but it was okay. The fresh lemonade is very good. Recommended if you're looking for a quick and healthy lunch near Penn Station.",1
3349,8,4,1/3/2013,"As anyone who works in the Penn station wasteland knows, the decent lunch options around here are few and far between. But Pio Pio Riko is a great newcomer on the scene and I will be going back often. You can spend $9 on a crappy salad or sandwich at any number of delis in the area or you can go here and get a half a chicken with rice and beans. Obviously the chicken with rice and beans is the right choice. The chicken is wonderfully tasty and moist as it should be. The half chicken is $8.50 and was way more food than I needed. Next time I'll get the quarter chicken (with rice and beans) for $6.50. What a bargain! The waitresses don't all speak very good English, but they are very sweet and nice. My coworkers and I were given a free piece of tres leches cake to share after our meal. It was so good we were fighting over the last bite. Ceviche is a little pricey for a weekday lunch, but I'll definitely splurge one day and try theirs. Maybe when on an expense account. By the way, they are now adding the tip onto the check for you, no matter how small your party (as of August 2013), so watch out for that and don't accidentally give them a double tip. Unless you really want to!",1
3350,8,5,1/2/2013,Very difficult to find a hearty well priced meal around Penn Station but the will be my new go to. My order to go came out in three minutes exactly. Under $10. Delicious meal that was still hot a half an hour later on the train.,1
3351,8,3,12/25/2012,"A new, nice, clean Peruvian Rotisserie Chicken spot with cheap prices (for Manhattan) in the shadow of Madison Square Garden/Penn Station. I had the half chicken with tostones and an avocado salad. Good stuff. I will definitely be back.",1
3352,8,5,12/20/2012,I got the half chicken (dark meat) and it was juicy and full of flavorful spices. I also got a cold mussel ceviche type appetizer that was pretty darn good too. The waitresses are cute ;) Could be a tad cheaper.,1
3353,8,5,12/6/2012,The place is sooo yummy. The chicken is like none you'll ever taste. And the green sauce is to die for. I googled the receipe to make it and it came out pretty good.,1
3354,8,1,12/5/2012,"How can anyone give this place anything more than one star, its not a real Pio Pio, its a ripoff!! Pio Pio Riko, is NOTHING like the original!!! The food is tasteless, theres no flavor in the chicken, beef, beans, the only saving grace was their green sauce which was served at the beginning with some corn nuts (how were we supposed to eat this was anyones guess, as no plates were provided). Â  The staff has a thin veneer of friendliness, and lacks any sort of waiting experience or manners for that matter. They seem to be young and dumb, only hired for their looks; the dirty blond hostess actually walked away from us in mid order for whatever reason, with no apology or customary mannerisms one would expect from a restaurant. Im not asking for nor expecting this to be a five star establishment, but i can get this level of service from any fast food place. Seeing this, another waitress came to take our order, she lacked experience but was much more friendly. Our food arrived quickly, which is to be expected from the uncomplicated menu. The presentation was ok, except for the salchi pappa (a hot dog) which looks like one of those trick cigars exploded from either end. My girlfriend had the chicken, which had none of the familiar flavor of a real Pio Pio chicken. The maduros weren't sweet at all, the beans were bland, all in all we were highly disappointed. Â  The bottom line is; anyone who thinks this food is good, has not experienced the real thing, save your money and time and go to the real Pio Pio on 34th st.",1
3355,8,5,11/18/2012,"The waitstaff are friendly hot women (how's that for a review start). Â They all have long black hair, dressed in a black uniform, nice butts, big smiles, and of course, Latina. Â The owner (or manager) flirts with them all. Â Lucky bastard; if I were him, I would too. My wife and I spent 3 weeks in Peru, and what first attracted us to this place were the authentic dishes listed on the menu. Â We will definitely come back to sample more of this restaurant. One of the Yelp reviews of the Bayside location (our waitress told us there are 6 locations in all) complained that the bill had a surreptitious unlisted charge which turned out to be a 15% tip. Â They asked about it and received a surly response that it was a compulsory tip. Â This is usually standard for groups, but for non-groups, this is not normal for a place like this. Â Not mentioning it, either on the menu or itemized on the bill, is definitely shady. Â  I have to confess I didn't look too carefully at our bill. Â I hope it's not true. Â We are definitely coming back and I'll be more vigilant. Â I would prefer to tip the 15% this person claims is on the bill than the 20% I normally tip. Anyway. Â  The decor is definitely Peruvian. Â A tad minimal, but pleasant. Â You don't feel like you're eating in a Peruvian tourist trap, but you're not eating in a cafeteria either. Â It almost felt like I was back in Peru. Food came quickly despite the fact that the place was busy. Â The waitstaff and kitchen are efficient. The complimentary Peruvian corn nuts and salsa verde were addicting. This neighborhood is a bit deficient for good eateries by NYC standards, so this restaurant is welcomed. Sopa de Gallina: B+ Unfortunately for Pio Pio Riko, I married a Hispanic, so I know how awesome Hispanic chicken soup can be. Â I loved this soup, and would've given it an A-. Â Compared to my wife's soup, this would be a B-, so I gave them a mercy B+. Â The soup has typical soup greens, vegetables (cassava, celery, etc) and noodles. Â The broth was not overly salty and had a wonderful cilantro flavor. Â The chicken was a 1/4 boiled piece which must have cooked for a long time because it was obviously not pre-cooked outside the soup (by the color) and wasn't rubbery. Lomo Saltado: A- Done very competently. Â The meat could've been a tad more tender, but otherwise, a flawless rendition of this classic Peruvian dish. 1/4 Pollo: A Chicken was awesome, pure and simple. Â The accompanying rice and beans had a *phenomenal* flavor. Â The whole dish was very impressive.",1

3361,9,4,2/6/2013,"This place hasn't been open long and I have already been five times. There not breaking any gastronomy grounds or doing anything specially innovative, but what they are doing is cooking your favorite foods and cooking them well. This is a perfect place for a great meal or simply just cocktails at the bar. What I really like and what they offer over the other new-american places in the area, is a completely unpretentious fine-dining experience. I have sat at both the dinning room and the bar and received excellent/friendly service from Steve (manager) and Alyssa at a table as well as Liam at the bar. Food wise, I have had almost everything on their seasonal menu and have eaten almost every last bite for each dish. Their burger is amazing and they make some kick-ass pastas. They have a fantastic cocktail menu and Liam at the bar is not afraid to go off menu and make something specified to your tastes. My only complaint is the prices are a bit high. However, I never feel like I overpaid after a dinning or drinking experience. If you are a bit thrifty, they do have cocktail/wine specials on the weekdays and half off bottles on Sunday nights. Oh, and their playlist rocks!",-1
3362,9,5,10/28/2013,"I should have written this review a long time ago, but on the positive side, by now I have been to Hunter's so many times that I have tried most of the dishes on each of their changing seasonal menus. Â A friend introduced me to the place when they first opened and I have been back many times since- for date nights with my boyfriend, dinner with friends and a few birthdays- even brought my parents here when they visited! Â I always start my meals there with a cocktail (current favorite is the Boba Fett!), and I love that they're all named after famous hunters throughout history. Â Their wine list is also great- Â it's cool that they chose to have all American wines. Â For appetizers, I love the mussels which come swimming in a fantastic salty-umami elixir of miso broth. Â The portion is a good size to share. Â The cheese plate is another favorite, especially because the cheeses come from the amazing Stinky Brooklyn store located next door. Â The kale salad is a must-have. Â I love the one at Battersby down the street, but this one hits the spot too. For entrees, you can't go wrong with one of their housemade pastas. Â The butternut squash agnolotti that's on the menu right now is one of my all-time favorites. Â As a big seafood fan, I also enjoy their seasonal selection of fish- it's always cooked perfectly and really flavorful- complemented, but not overshadowed by the accompaniments. The servers here are super sweet and recognize me when I come in now. Â Even when it's really busy they make it feel warm and welcoming. Â Hunter's is a place to return to again and again, to revisit old favorites and find new ones!",-1
3363,9,5,4/27/2013,"This is quickly becoming my favorite neighborhood spot. The food is SO DELICIOUS, and is a bit unusual while still being accessible to a wide range of dietary preferences. Brunch is a particular treat, though I almost don't want to admit that because I like that there's rarely a wait for a table... If you go, get the french toast. It's unreal. I also love the grilled kale salad. I've never had anything quite like it but it's just a perfect combination of flavors. I even tried to make it at home but it paled in comparison.

Make sure to order the toast of the day as an appetizer or snack at the bar, you won't regret it. If you're looking for a low key bar Hunter's is open late and draws an attractive young crowd.",-1
3368,9,3,1/1/2015,"I think my first visit does warrant a second chance, although there are some key issues that would suggest a permanent boycott. The brunch items are small. The salads are tiny. The coffee, is cold bittter and cynical like my uncle Nick. And they serve Blue Bottle. Blue Bottle! And it was bad! How do you mess that up??!!! Apart from that, the flavors in the farmers market bowl were ok; I expected more and fresher. My gf's eggs benedict were good and my sisters' salads were not good and tiiiiiny. $12 for 2 slices of beets (not sure if they were canned but maybe)? Hmmmm... Its a nice warm place and has good intentions, but for now were on pause.",1
3369,9,4,12/25/2014,"On a cold evening my friend and I tried to take a little trip to Cobble Hill to check out some new bars. At one point we ended up at Hunter's. Hunter's is a cute bar/restaurant with the friendliest service I've ever received. We weren't there very long, but long enough for my friend to order a burger with waffle fries, the fries were excellent and she liked her burger. I had one of their hot ciders, so good and strangely refreshing on such a cold night. It wasn't a super busy place the night we went, which was a Thursday, so if you're looking for a nice place that is kind of low key I would say come check this place out.",1
3370,9,4,12/15/2014,I returned a second time and found the food to be all around much better. I had a few cocktails also which were all very good. I do believe the first time was a fluke. I'll be back.,1
3371,9,2,12/13/2014,"Went here on a Friday night at 10pm with my husband and another couple. When we walked in, they looked at us then came over after 5 minutes. I asked for a table for four and they seemed annoyed. Keep in mind that they close at midnight. We were seated and within 2 minutes our server asked what we wanted to eat. They were clearly rushing us. FOOD- We ordered the mussels and truffle fries to start. The broth of the mussels was good but the bread in the broth was burnt so it ruined the entire dish. The truffle fries were good mainly because they were french fries- and it's pretty difficult to mess up fries. Â  MEALS- 2 burgers, faro salad and the hanger steak. The burgers were OK- bun was soggy. Saving grace were the fries! Hanger steak- medium rare was requested and the steak came so charred and burnt that it was inedible. Faro Salad- was terrible because the faro wasn't cooked correctly. SERVICE- Considering they were not welcoming, rushed us to order and rushed us out the door, I would say it was terrible. Our waiter was rude and for the first time EVER I considered not leaving him a tip. As a former server my husband insisted we leave him one.",1
3372,9,4,12/5/2014,"If I lived anywhere near here, I would frequent Hunter's regularly. We booked it pretty last minute on a Friday on OpenTable and by the time we were leaving at 9pm it was packed. We absolutely loved our waiter, he was fun, educated on the menu and just a good one. We had a delicious farro salad that was SO flavorful, an insanely amazing grilled kale salad and the special pasta with a lemon sauce that we smelled the second they brought it to the table. The bread pudding was good, not amazing. Everything else was fantastic. Great music, ambiance, etc. Can't wait to go back one day.",1
3373,9,5,12/4/2014,"I had an amazing times at Hunter's! I've been twice (once with a large group & more recently with my boyfriend), and I know I'll definitely keep returning in the future. The interior is really well done - cute enough that a group of girls loved it, but simple enough that my boyfriend also remarked on it. The first time I came, I had a reservation, and the table was ready a few minutes early. The next time, I didn't have a reservation, but my boyfriend and I were seated right away at the window, which was perfect for people watching as we ate brunch! Both times I had the mussels, and they were amazing! Not many places serve mussels for brunch, so that's something that really makes Hunter's stand out to me. I LOVE mussels, and I also don't really like breakfast-y foods, so it's perfect. They give you a ton of delicious mussels, and the bread that comes with them is amazing. The menu is also very reasonably priced, especially for the quality of the food. All of my friends loved their food as well. My boyfriend had the burger, and he said that it was such a good burger that putting ketchup on it would ruin it. We also split the sweet potatoes, which were perfect (especially with the amazing broth from the mussels)! And the coffee was great, especially the sugar cubes. The owner, Fer, is really, really great! The first time I ate here, I was slightly overcharged for the mussels (they put in the dinner price, not the brunch price). When Fer found out, he was extremely accommodating and really went above & beyond what was expected to correct this mistake. I really appreciate all that he did for us! Can't wait to go back!",1
3374,9,4,11/26/2014,"The pumpkin, farrow and pepetin entry was amazing! Â Tasty, substantial like a cassoulet. Â I had the burger and fries. The burger is a solid staple very delicious and awhile I'm not a big fries guy, I ate more than my fair share. The saltiness and crispyness of the fries made for a delicious treat.",1
3375,9,3,11/22/2014,Food is good although a couple of times the description on the menu didn't match the actual dish (overstated). The service has been very good.,1
3376,9,4,11/18/2014,"Solid food, great drinks, cool atmosphere...what else is needed for Saturday night dinner..",1
3377,9,5,11/16/2014,"Came in after a long cold day at storm king, the hostess and staff were super warm which was great cause i was frozen solid! It was a big group of us we sat up at the communal table by the bar, we all had different cocktails and they were all different and unique and very tasty everyone loved them. as for the food everything was on point nothing crazy just solid comfort couldn't ask for anything more. will definitely be back for more of those truffle fries and the katniss everdeen.",1
3378,9,1,11/16/2014,"Came in here for brunch this Sunday with my girlfriend. (Just FYI we both work in great restaurants here in NYC). Looks like a nice place, cozy vibe, tasty looking menu. Unfortunately the food was awful. Not just mediocre, but bad. My girlfriend ordered the ""special"" which was an omelette with sweet potatoes. The omelette looked and tasted worse then any McDonald egg would probably taste. The ""salad"" that came as her side was nothing more then lettuce placed on the dish. No dressing, no mixed greens, no vegetables, tomatoes, no nothing. I ordered the Chill-A-Chicken. Better then the omelette but still very boring. Definitely not worth 12 bucks. Maybe 5. I was excited for this place, now I have no interest of ever coming back or recommending it. It's really disappointing when this happens because I hate wasting money and giving bad reviews.",1
3379,9,4,11/13/2014,"I and another visited in late August. My drink was very good; Duneagle something. Salad was very good. Mussels smelled bad, but tasted pretty good. The smell tho was noxious and I wished the server had taken them away after we had stopped eating them. The server was mildly inattentive; in fairness, I did tell him that he could put in everything at once. Pork chop was very good; the peas with bacon and goat cheese fondue was fantastic. My companion very much enjoyed the squash; I was not a fan, but I don't generally enjoy squash anyways.",1
3380,9,2,11/10/2014,"Greeted with warm and inviting service, the food was just a let down. If you don't mind rubbery omelettes and mushrooms, dry and crumbly burgers, then perhaps you'll enjoy this place.",1
3381,9,4,11/8/2014,"A friend recommended this brunch place to me so we went last week with our family. We were seated in the back. The restaurant is very cute! We ordered our food and it took FOREVER. Over an hour to get our meals and it wasn't anything difficult. We got the butternut squash soup which was awesome. To share as a starter. For a meal I had the eggs Benedict and the potatoes (which were the best part). Kind of weird that they charge you 3 dollars more for breakfast potatoes with a breakfast meal though, just sayin. We shared the pancakes because we all wanted to try them. The food makes this a 4 star place but the service was pretty awful. The waitress seemed to feel bad- there just have been a mix up in the back because other tables didn't seem to have the same issue.",1
3382,9,4,11/1/2014,"A really solid neighborhood option. Good quality food, decent prices, a nice atmosphere. What really stood out was the service. Our waiter was super friendly and accommodating, without being over intrusive (I'd even forgive him the Liverpool FC polo shirt!). Just a really nice, unpretentious vibe about the place.",1
3383,9,4,10/27/2014,"Great spot for a casual lunch or dinner and drinks. The menu has a great variety that almost everyone can find something to their liking. Â I had a salad and burger with truffle fries. The food was fresh and the ingredients they use are definitely prime including the beef. The burger was delicious and juicy. Food 4 stars Ambiance 4 stars, its nothing amazing but its exactly what you would expect to get out of bar type dining. Service 4 stars Great for a date or grabbing dinner and drinks with friends.",1
3384,9,5,10/8/2014,A couple friends and I were actually planning on drinks and dinner at Clover Club across the street but it was closed for a private event. We stumbled in here and were not disappointed! The boba fett was a refreshing pear drink that wasn't overly sweet. The farro and pumpkin salad was delicious! And I devoured my entire chicken breast with jus and black wild rice dish.,1
3385,9,4,10/2/2014,"Friends+ Good Food+ Good Drinks = a really fun time! I gathered a group of my girlfriends to come celebrate my birthday at Hunter's and it was wonderful! Our waitress was super nice and attentive and the food and drinks were great. I got Salmon a la plancha with grilled corn, lime-mayo, queso fresco and chili oil. Yum!! I love Mexican food so any kind of Mexican twist to my food is a bonus. We even got a bread pudding dessert on the house which was super delish and a great ending to a great meal!",1
3386,9,4,10/2/2014,"Great to have this in the neighborhood. Â The cocktails -- especially the handsome hound -- is great. especially as the nights turn colder. always an interesting array of new items on the menu. Â i think they broke the curse of this location, which has seen so many restaurant failures.",1
3387,9,2,9/30/2014,"Disappointing. Â Started out well, good cocktail and chicken liver moose to start. Â Went done hill when they came out with our mains when we were still eating out starters! Â Whipped my plate away and I still was eating!! Â My cod on a bed of lentils and greens ( about a teaspoon of lentils). Was very very bland. Â Felt very rushed, sat down at 8.30 and was out of there before 9.30, not what I consider to be a good Saturday night out :-/",1
3388,9,4,9/28/2014,"Hunters has been a great addition to Smith Street. Food is very good (love their Mac and cheese), drinks are simple and delicious (love that they have an assortment of cocktails blade with bourbon). Â The staff is also great, aways friendly. Crowd is decent too, usually people in their early 30's and up.",1
3389,9,3,9/27/2014,"Just had brunch with my girlfriend, and I would say that the food is a 3.5 the Chill-a-Killers were really tasty, the poached eggs in the benedict were overcooked, the standout was the homemade chicken breakfast sausage that was a 5. Â The staff was nice, personable and attentive, the mimosas were ok (the cucumber one wasn't for me but my girlfriend loved it), the coffee was good, overall I would give it another chance.",1
3390,9,3,9/21/2014,"I had brunch here because Clover Club from across the street won't give me water after sitting down for 20 minutes. Â The service here is superb, as our coffee cups were never empty the entire hour we were there. Â For brunch, my husband's mussels were a little too bland, and my pancake was ok good (I love Cafe Luluc's but hubby says it's not pancake but a cake). Â I will come back for dinner because nice people always deserve second chances!",1
3391,9,4,9/19/2014,We came here 2.5 years ago when they started and it was just okay. Now we are back and the stars are aligned. The specials are phenomenal. The grilled zucchini stuffed with lamb was sensational. Salmon tare tare was so fresh and perfect. Like sashimi at the most upscale sushi restaurant. Then when the burratta ravioli came it surprised us onin the best way possible. They did ravioli with aldente snow peas and prosciutto. Yum yum. Â My husband hugged the chef.,1
3392,9,3,9/17/2014,"Came here on a Friday night with the lady and a friend Getting in: - Walked in and were seated immediately Atmosphere: - Small resto with a bar in the front off to the side. Plenty of seating in back as well - Dimly lit, but not dark, nice casual vibe Service: - Very good Food: - Food was good - Summer Squash Orzotto was very good - Beets were great - Peas Peas Peas were great - 3 different types of peas - Lady got the polenta which she liked, I thought it was on the salty side, which means it was heavily salted b/c polenta is a flavor sucker - Friend got the salmon which was pretty good, I liked it - I got the pork chop which was not exactly what I was expecting. Â It was kind of thin and on the dry side with a piece of cheese on top (the fondue had gotten cold my the time it reached me). Â Maybe if it was hotter it would have been better, looks like it sat for a little while Drinks: - Wine list was ok, I was kind of disappointed with the by the glass selection and after that the bottles started to get a little steep Other: - Nice neighborhood spot - Will be back to try this place out for brunch - Prices seemed a touch high",1
3393,9,5,9/13/2014,"Tried Hunter's tonight for the first time, based substantially on great Yelp reviews. Didn't quite know what to expect but had a really fantastic meal - couldn't be more pleasantly surprised. Started with oysters and what may be the best corn side dish I've had in my life - kinda creamy / salty / buttery / crisp corn. Husband had super yummy 4 cheese Mac and cheese with bacon. I had linguini with meatballs in a pimento cheese sauce. Such a surprise and really tasty and spicy. We shared a peas side (3 types of peas, mint, bacon) that was really fresh and perfectly cooked. Space is warm and inviting, larger than it looks from the front with a nice bar and great drinks. Server was attentive and helpful with out being overbearing. Special perk - they take reservations (LOVE not having to stand on the street waiting for hours) Well definitely be back - and highly recommend.",1
3394,9,5,8/31/2014,French toast is awesome! Â Spicy Bloody Mary was excellent! Â Others dining with had very good good as well. Service was also very good. Would recommend this establishment for great food.,1
2318,9,5,8/28/2014,One of my favorite brunch spots! Absolutely loved the Benedict and the Elvis French Toast was one of a kind! I opted for a Rusty Bulleit to cleanse the palate and provide the finishing touches for the wonderful experience... I highly recommend!,1
3395,9,4,8/27/2014,"The serve their tap water out of old Bulleit rye bottles..before I even got my food, I was in love with this place! Being fairly new to the neighborhood, Hunters's was the few places on Smith looked appealing to me. From the service to the drinks and food, everything was wonderful. I thought everything was priced reasonably. Mussels: so flavorful and buttery (love that they added greens along with your standard bread). Had two pastas, both very delicious. At first glance, the portion sizes look 'small' but I couldn't finish my linguine and meatballs. The Handsome Hound (a whiskey drink) and equitos, a side dish of creamy corny, were both a great accompaniment to my meal. 100% would come back. Friendly service, delicious food, great vibe overall!",1
3396,9,4,8/19/2014,"The burger is amazing, as well as the mussels. Â Really nice local crowd, our neighborhood spot. Â They always have fun inventing new cocktails - sometimes the experiments go awry but we're never left wanting. Â Zach goes out of his way to make us feel at home.",1
3397,9,3,8/9/2014,"ill get the bad out of the way first: when the house cured salmon got to our table i literally thought it was a joke. Â it's about 6 pieces of BITE sized cubes of salmon sprinkled on a large plate with some random greens. Â it is NOT even worth $2 let alone whatever ridiculous price Hunter's charges. Â that menu item needs to be rethought out for sure...it is embarrassing. that being said: the octopus and mussels were amazing and the service is on point...the waitress was sweet and her amazing rack didn't hurt either. the bread pudding for dessert was OK...won't be ordering it again. this place is decent but when you don't have anything on draft i'm wondering what's going on especially in this neighborhood. Â i get that you're a cocktail bar, but with the outdoorsy theme i'm not seeing the connection. Â  i will return!",1
3398,9,4,8/9/2014,"I met a friend here for brunch because she raves about this place being a hidden gem in her neighborhood, and I'll have to agree with her. Â The staff was quick and attentive, and the menu kept it difficult for me to choose just one thing. Â I look forward to returning for more!",1
3399,9,1,8/3/2014,Tried hunters for the second time First time was brunch and I was far from being good So I gave it a second chance for dinner this time. Ordered the famous kale salad. Waiter came back 10m later saying they were out Ordered then the chicken Waiter came back another 10m or do later saying they were out By then I had nothing to eat and my date was already done with his appetizer So I tried the burger.... Asked to have it medium When it arrived to the table it was rare Sent it back to kitchen Came back as medium rare but definitely not medium Was also missing their famous aioli They kept apologizing but altogether not a good experience at all Will not go back!,1
3400,9,3,8/3/2014,Kale salad is delicious. Fries are good but a bit salty. Meatball sandwich is boring bordering on bad. Service is extraordinarily slow: don't go if you have anywhere to be or anything better to do.,1
3401,9,5,7/26/2014,Delicious brunch and fairly priced. The decor is simple and homey and the Huevos Rancheros were perfect. I can't wait to go back for happy hour!,1
3402,9,4,7/22/2014,"As everyone has said, the kale salad was amazing and vegan friendly for my passionate vegan friends out there. I chose a vegetarian entree myself and got the farmers basket which was essentially an awesome warm salad with a poached egg. I was most impressed with the cocktails, mainly the one made with 'Ecuadorian moonshine' - it tasted like a fancy alcoholic version of an orange cremesicle - if I wasn't so responsible I would have spoiled the rest of my brunch and evening drinking those. My party of 3 was sitting at a table at the front and the front windows/doors of the restaurant were opened up onto the streets so the whole experience was great. Great service and food, would definitely come back here again!",1
3403,9,5,7/18/2014,"I went there yesterday for dinner with my boyfriend and everything was great. The food was awesome (we had the burger), I loved the decor and the waitress was really nice and professional. The prices are a little high though.",1
3404,9,2,7/15/2014,"Came here only for brunch; the menu was promising but it definitely fell short of expectations. The truffle fries were over fried; the ingredients for the omelette had salivating while waiting for it, but was personally not impressed. The staff was friendly, they offered Blue Bottle coffee, and the space itself was pretty cool; I may need to try the dinner here again based on the many positive reviews.",1
3405,9,4,7/13/2014,"Loved this place! Went there as a party of 8. It was a bit early for dinner, so I wasn't sure what to expect in regards to service. ( 5 o'clock) It's always weird when places are I'm between meals. We were instantly met by Zac, who had our table ready to go, ( I made a reservation on open table) and was super friendly. Our entire party wasn't there, but that was no problem. I hate when places make you wait. The menu is so simple and everything sounded so good! I really couldn't decide! We started with the cheese and meats, the chicken liver mousse with bacon and shallot marmalade. The liver was really really good! Everyone was very happy with their dinner. I had the ravioli and the soup of the day was cold squash. Also delish!! Others in my group had: The linguine with meatballs Salmon with a chili oil It was all so fresh and simple. No over done plating or dressings. Atmosphere was nice. Again we got there very early for dinner, but it did start to fill up as we were leaving. Zac was so great. He really made us feel like we were long time friends and made or first visit a really nice one. Oh! Wait it gets better... Happy hour ( on a Saturday?! YES! ) 2 for one, on some of the most yummy specialty cocktails! Group favs were the Boba Fet and the Handsome Hound. Looking forward to going back! Enjoy folks.",1
3406,9,4,7/1/2014,"Loved: Incredible Menu - was tough to decide, I wanted it all! Mescal Cocktail - yes yes yes Grilled Kale Salad - delish! Fried Cornish Hen -crunchy & juicy Truffle Fries - truffle oil makes everything better Friendly Service - sweet Disliked: Kind of had a weird smell in there Very dark - I like to see what I'm eating I'd go back though despite my dislikes! Â :)",1
3407,9,4,6/25/2014,"OMG, the Elvis. Â  Â that was awesome. Â nice space, attentive staff. Â Food was awesome. Â if you are hungry ,please try the Elvis french toast(peanut butter, banana).",1
3408,9,1,6/14/2014,I went to Hunter's with my husband for a brunch. Â We had gone there before and really liked it. It was a weird vibe the minute we got there. Â The place was not packed and we got a table fast. Â We got menus and waited. Â Our waitress came gave us water and never spoke or looked at us. Â  We knew what we wanted and waited. Â Our waitress totally ignored us and proceeded to have a whole conversation at the bar with her pals while we waited. Save your money and skip this place. Â The amount of disrespect at this place was horrible! Walked over to Ceol and we were greeted with a smile and warmth.,1
3409,9,5,5/18/2014,"Was walking down Smith Street with my Dad and Brother who were in from out of town. Â My pops is a foodie so I wanted him to have a really great meal. Chef Josh did not disappoint! Besides the enticing dishes, the bartender Zach went out if his way to make my family feel at home. Â We were overwhelmed with the Hunter's team and their warmth and welcoming kindness. Â Thanks guys for a perfect evening out! PS the Kale salad is ""still working""",1
3410,9,4,5/17/2014,Just for drinks. Popped by for happy hour 2 for 1 drinks. The drinks we tried were great - some serious cocktails. The bartender was super friendly and chill and explained a little bit about the drinks. Would love to come back to try the food.,1
3411,9,1,5/15/2014,"This place was great. The food really took me back to that one time I ate at the best restaurant in Des Moines, Iowa. The Red Quinoa Risotto was just quinoa in a plate of what appeared to be melted mozzarella. The salad seemed like it had been inspired by an episode of Top Chef--but lacked any thought as to the proper proportions or ingredients. And while the pork chop was good it honestly felt like they just lucked out on that particular dish. If this restaurant was in Des Moines, it would be great. But it's in a neighborhood, in a city, where you can have some of the best meals of your life so it has to be graded on that curve.",1
3412,9,5,5/2/2014,"Came back to Hunters to give them a second shot, and boy am I glad I did! They really wowed me with... a) great food b) super service c) cool, inventive drinks. What more could anyone want?! As always the staff is awesome. Shout out to Zach, the talented and super cool bartender. He whipped us up a couple of handsome hounds which were incredible. Think corn and rye whiskey, orange bitters, sweet vermouth and a brandied cherry which just explodes in your mouth. Food- got the burger medium rare which came out perfectly. Sheer genius. I love a good burger- the soft, buttery brioche roll, the meat that drips juice down your chin, the pizazz brought to you by the incredible pickled onions. Oh and the cilantro jalapeÃ±o aioli - I know something is good when I don't even like the main ingredient (cilantro) and yet I love it in a dish that its in. Basically, I love a burger that's so good that I don't even need to put ketchup on it. My recommendation- come to Hunters. You will have a tasty and enjoyable experience:)",1
3413,9,2,5/2/2014,"So mediocre for the pricing. Ordered drinks and a cheese plate as an appetizer, waited for a long time for the cheese, which when it came was tasty, but TINY portions. The entrees took a long time and the dining room was only half way full. The burger was fine, but at $19 with bacon it should have been amazing! The fish was a real disappointment, over salted and over cooked...and the whole plate was bland, and for $24 it was tiny too. When the bill came we realized they charged us an additional $3 for the Truffle fries, so the burger cost $22!! Overpriced, and so underwhelming, with so many good restaurants in this neighborhood I will never return.",1
3414,9,5,5/2/2014,"Love the bartender and chef combination here. Â It's a laid back vibe, comfortable and not pretentious. Â I particularly like sitting and eating at the bar, you feel so welcome and the food is appropriate and satisfying. Â I believe the chef is from Dylan prime (one of my old standbys back in the day) which is probably why I'm thrilled about the really good non pretentious dishes to match the vibe and bartender. Â It is now a go-to place for me. Â Sometimes you need a place that fits you like a glove.",1
3415,9,4,4/25/2014,"Came here for a quick dinner recently and found it absolutely lovely. It had been a cooler day and I was in need of something a little hearty to warm me up. Enter Hunters Mac & cheese, a side of minted peas and a bottle of red wine shared with friends. The portion size of the Mac & cheese was bigger than what I expected and I couldn't finish. So excellent value for money on that front. The minted peas were delicious and a good compliment for the Mac & cheese.",1
3416,9,3,4/22/2014,"I have to say that the fact that we could make a reservation here with 8 people for Brunch was really a hallelujah moment...I've totally forgotten what it's like to go to a brunch place and have it not be a 3-4 hour affair! Unfortunately while the food is good and they have a nice atmosphere and they even serve blue bottle coffee (yay!), it's not something that I thought was outstandingly delicious and needed a second visit (other than when we're in a pinch for a brunch spot with a large crowd).",1
3417,9,5,4/12/2014,"I stopped counting how many times I've been there. Brunch, lunch, dinner, it doesn't matter: everything is consistently delicious. The only thing that doesn't make me happy is that they switch to spring menu and i won't get to eat my favorite pappardelle with a boar and wild mushrooms any time soon, but I'm pretty sure i'll find something else to crave about. Staff is superfriendly and professional, i guess i can say it's my to go spot in the neighbourhood. Interior is cool, i have a hound dog so haunting theme is very close to me. Other thing i like is that they have great selection of beers with weird names. So if you want to have great food, drinks and service you should give these guys a chance to take care of it, because they definitely will.",1
3418,9,5,4/12/2014,Best kale salad ever. Best truffle fries ever. A+!,1
3419,9,3,4/7/2014,brunch was ok. a bit over priced for what was dilivered. the drinks here are pretty good.,1
3420,9,2,4/6/2014,"The last time I was here was sometime last year. Â I'm pretty bummed that the kale salad with couscous and green goddess dressing isn't on the menu anymore. Â I know that restaurants need to change up their menu to stay fresh, but that salad was like no other. Â I have yet to find anything else that matches up to it. Â I was even willing to overlook the awful service my friend and I received the last time I was there. Â I don't think I have ever waited over an hour for a salad before. Â They said it was because the salad cook wasn't there. Â I say, if you know that it is going to take that long then you should say something to your customers about it. Â I was the one that had to keep asking the waitstaff why everyone around us was receiving their food and we weren't. Â Our waiter was rude and unapologetic. Â Again, I would overlook this experience if the salad was on the menu. Â It is not, so I will not be back.",1
3421,9,3,3/16/2014,"We came on Friday night and were ushered to the bar by the cordial wait staff while our table was being prepared. The Bartender or mixologist (if they concoct their own original mixes) is very friendly, attentive and will try to work with you a specific cocktail of your liking, he gets a 4 star for that. But on food part, aside from being quite expensive, there was nothing in particular that really blew me away, decent but you can easily find it elsewhere.",1
3422,9,4,3/10/2014,"The food was delicious, the atmosphere was casual but classy. The staff was extremely efficient and our food came out within 5 minutes even though the whole place was full. The only negative was that is was uncomfortably warm inside.",1
3423,9,4,3/4/2014,"Went for brunch at 1pm. Place was not that full and were seated in less than 10 minutes. We sat at a table right by the bar and were served by the bartender and kept the drinks coming. We ordered the bobba fett, winter is coming, cucumber mimosas, and regular mimosas and we were coasting pretty well. We ordered yogurt pancakes for the table which were dense and sweet. They were amazingly delicious but not incredibly filling. We also ordered the Elvis french toast which was AWESOME. Very peanut buttery and humongous. We also got the Hunter's Benedict, Huevos Rancheros, and a burger and I can't really say it was superb but it was very good. The food tasted exactly like I imagined by reading the menu so i wasn't surprised and I wasn't let down. The real reason I really love this place is the drinks, the staff, and how solidly good the food is. The staff was incredibly kind and attentive and we just really had a good time here. I would definitely recommend this place!!",1
3424,9,4,3/4/2014,"Went here for a late brunch on Sunday and ordered a burger and fries. Best burger I have eaten in recent memory. Wow! It had some kind of spicy mayo on it, which was amazing. Fries were delicious too. They also had a decent selection of craft beer which is always a plus in my book. Wasn't too crowded when I went and it had a nice atmosphere, friendly staff.",1
3425,9,3,2/23/2014,"I appreciate the abbreviated menu for brunch, standard choices. Edison lights, exposed brick, fancy brunch drinks, water out of bourbon bottles, flowers in mason jars - we've all seen it before. It's your standard manufactured ""vintage"" place. Come here with friends and try to ignore the mediocrity of the food and atmosphere.",1
3426,9,2,2/12/2014,"Hmm I guess Hunters just wasn't a great match for me. I found the cocktails to leave much to be desired, especially with Clover Club being directly across the street. I expected more from the food as well, given the great reviews. I ordered the Kale salad to start, followed by striped bass with faro, wanting to dine on the healthy side. The Kale salad was excellent, though heavy for a salad. I would have been happy if that were my entree, even shared. Then came the bass. I was expecting it to be prepared light and fresh, yet instead found a bass masked behind way too much butter, salt, and cream. I could hardly eat half, and a week later, I still feel a bit sick thinking about it. Yes it is winter, and the theme of the restaurant is a rustic, animal heavy place. But I found myself searching with my fork for a bite of something less engorged in fat and salt, which is never a good sign. In my opinion, good food should not have to hide behind the flavors of fat and salt; they should rather be used to highlight the flavors of quality natural ingredients. I am not butter-phobic by any means, but I left here feeling heavy, and could taste the cream on my tongue for the next hour after my meal. Unfortunately, Hunters was not for me. But if you're looking for a heavy meal with huge portion sizes and interesting food, maybe it's your kind of place.",1
3427,9,5,2/11/2014,"A PERFECT MEAL. I brought my parents here for dinner on a snowy night. They are lifetime New Yorkers who love good, healthy food and are hard to please. They LOVED Hunter's. We ordered practically the entire menu, and each item was spectacular. My father adored his kale salad, my mother loved the wild fish, I loved the squash pasta and market lettuces, and my cousin loved the farro risoto and beet salad. We were offered a half-price bottle of wine, and the service was incredibly warm. This is my first Yelp restaurant review ever--I just wanted everyone to know that Hunter's is doing a great job! Bon appetit!",1
3428,9,2,2/4/2014,"The food at Hunters is very good. The staff is variable- some are friendly and helpful, others blasÃ© and too cool for school. What bothers me is that Hunters does not clear the snow in front of their restaurant on an extremely busy stretch of Smith Street. Snow turns to ice, and today several people in front of me fell on the slippery surface this morning. I tried my best not to follow their suit but failed and fell. I called Hunters and left a voicemail alerting them of the issue, and let them know that I fell. I never received a return call or an apology. Tonight the ice is gone, but I am still annoyed about their carelessness and lack of apology.",1
3429,9,3,2/3/2014,"We tried to go across the street to Clover Club and were informed, quite coldly, that there would be a long wait. Â It was 10 pm and I was starving, so to Hunters we went! Â And I was pleasantly surprised! Â The cheese plate was pretty pricey for the meager portions, but aside from that, everything was delicious. Â The brussel sprouts and bacon were very tasty, and my date's burger looked delicious. Â They were able to prepare it how he likes it, very rare. Â We had wine and beer, but they had an extensive cocktail list that looked nice. Â I'd love to come back for brunch, which looks like they do well!",1
3430,9,5,2/1/2014,"This is my second time here since my last review and the owner/manager I presume walks up to me ""hey u liked the apple cider last time you were here right?? Me- yes I loved it. Him-here u go it's on the house. I love this place!! Hunters you have a loyal customer for as long as you are open and my friends must come with me. Cheers!",1
3431,9,5,1/31/2014,"Hunter's has great food, great atmosphere, great drinks and great service. It's just an all around wonderful place to spend time eating and enjoying with friends. I wish I live closer so I could go more often, but each time I've been I've been impressed by the menu and always leave full of delicious food and drinks.",1
3432,9,5,1/29/2014,"This place just opened and it's amazing!!! Sean, the bartender, had amazing suggestions but really the seasonal menu has lots to offer in a small selection!! Check it out!!!!",1
3433,9,5,1/29/2014,"I came here with a party of 6 for a friend's birthday. We had a great time and the food was excellent. I am drooling thinking about it. The meat and cheese plates are delicious, though a little pricey. The steak tartare is awesome. I got the wild boar pasta and loved every bite. Is it gauche to lick the bowl? We wracked up a giant bill (I am talking over 500 bucks ACK!) but we got about three appetizers, 6 entrees and a ton of drinks. The cocktails are a steep 10-13 bucks each, but if you aren't a bunch of drunks like we are you probably won't get into the same predicament.",1
3434,9,5,1/26/2014,"I really love this place. Not only have I never had to wait for a table, but every time I go the food and service is amazing. While I have yet to drink here, I'd like to soon! The booze selection looks awesome. Thankfully, the food is great and reason enough to come to Cobble Hill. The brunch French toast is awesome, it's filled with peanut butter and bananas. Mmm. Service is cheery, and vibe is nice.",1
3435,9,5,1/17/2014,"Grilled kale salad, warm olives, roast chicken, roasted squash pasta--everything I had was fantastic.",1
3436,9,4,1/15/2014,"Really good food. Nice staff. The truffle fries are the best I've ever had. Â They actually tasted like truffles. Â The kale salad was yummy. Â My husband is a burger expert and loved it especially w the aged cheddar. Portions are a bit small so it is a little pricey cause you will need an appetizer w an entree, but it is worth it.",1
3437,9,5,1/15/2014,I still have dreams about the grilled kale salad....,1
3438,9,4,1/10/2014,"Good food. Not too crowded. Lively scene. Steak tartare was delicious. Everything was appropriately paired and fresh. It came with charred rustic bread, crispy onion fritters and frizzy lettuce. The seasoning was minimal letting the ingredients speak for themselves. The pappardelle was awesome! Fresh made pasta, flavorful pulled pork, mushroom, tomato and a lump of fresh ricotta. Not too creamy, tomato sauce is light doesn't taste like ketchup. Beet salad with walnuts and yogurt was very good as well. Not my favorite beet salad but definitely does the ingredients justice and still delicious. I couldn't tell what kind of yogurt was used the beet covered the flavor. The Manhattan was pretty good. The beer selection tells me they know their beers. The entire place smells like actual apple and cinnamon. In a good way not like scented candle.",1
3439,9,5,12/22/2013,"On the basis of the grilled kale salad I had for brunch today, I give this place 5 stars. I've had their breakfast sandwich before, kinda dry, nothing too exciting. But this salad, holy sharkballs. It was so smoky (the grilled kale and roasted squash?) I felt like I was eating meat. The hard egg was a nice touch of 'breakfast.' And how fun were those popped chickpeas giving texture to the kale, dampened by stoneground mustard vinaigrette which had a nice kick that have a wasabi-like tingle to the nose? So, yeah, just get the damned thing already. As for service, it's relaxed and unobtrusive, performed by the stereotypical Brooklyn 20-something. Possibly hipster, but mostly laid back yet stylish. Not obnoxiously trying to have fun on the job, unlike those real hipsters at Grey Dog Coffee (I think it's part of the job interview). P.S. As a kid of the late 90s and early 2000s the musical curation of N'Sync, Vanessa Carlton, The Darkness and Daft Punk made me a little giddy. Can't remember the last time I said that about brunch.",1
2018,9,5,12/22/2013,"Was here on an Elite event. The drinks are super funny. With the names like Ginny Weasley, you can't expect anything bad about this place. The bartender is super nice. Even he's so busy, he make sure you get your request within the first few minutes. I am impress. Come work for me :D Well the food is delicious. Sorry for the late comers, we finish that big plate of cheese and slice meat. That sauce on the table is gone. I want more. Definitely come back just for that. That crab cake is really filling and top with chipotle sauce. DELICIOUS!! I had 2!! and need to work it off soon. I love holiday season. The ambiance is pretty loud and crowded at the event however I can feet it's going to be a nice sit down place for quick happy hour drinks. It's a family neighborhood after all.",1
3440,9,5,12/15/2013,"I came here in late October with Ingrid S. as our second to last stop on the Smith Street Cocktail Classic contest thingie. The cocktail that they were competing with was called an ""Eddie Brock"" I nearly died. I'm a comic book nerd when I want to be and immediately knew that Eddie Brock is the SpiderMan character that turns into Venom when a symbiote attached itself to him and then...yeah okay...this is about Huntrer's and their deliciousness :). The Eddie Brock is a gin based cocktail (as were all the ones in the Smith Street Cocktail Classic) that was created by Greg Huertas & Zach Smith. Ingredients included: Ginsmith's Gin, Pear Nectar, Orange Bitters, Thyme-Infused Simple Syrup, Fresh-Squeezed Lemon Juice, Lejay Cassis and some freshly ground nutmeg or black pepper...I can't remember that last step. __________________________________________________Â­____________ What really made this drink a winner in my book were two things: 1.) It started off a very, very light green color and then when the cassis was poured in it got dark and kinda gloopy and haunted looking...JUST LIKE WHEN EDDIE BROCK TURNS INTO VENOM AND THE BLACK GOOPY SYMBIOTE GETS ALL DARK AND WEIRD!!! Perfectly named and executed cocktail. Simply perfection. 2.) Gin is one of my least favorite liquors, however as of late I've been able to handle it more and more if A.) it's a GOOD gin and not some cheap crap B.) if it's expertly mixed. Hunter's cocktail hit on both of those points. The ""Eddie Brock"" was delicious, refreshing, had an interesting and complex variety of notes and ultimately was strong, without being overwhelmingly so. Nerdiness (not a word, whatever - it stays) aside, I LOVED IT. __________________________________________________Â­____________ Ingrid S. and I didn't just stop there! No way! After we examined their cocktail menu and coming to the realization that this is a NERD BAR IN EFFECT we decided to try two new cocktails. I went with one out of their three signature cocktails, the ""Katniss Everdeen"" (Apple Jack, St. Germain, White Lillet and Peychaud's Bitters) and Ingrid selected the ""Boba Fett"". I found mine to be amazingly delicious, interesting, sweet - but not TOO sweet - and not very strong, which is fine because something tells me that this is the type of cocktail and sneaks up on you when you're not paying attention. The Boba Fett was lemony and must have been a part of their seasonal menu because ingredients on their website (and the Googles) are nowhere to be found. At this point yours truly was starving and I wanted to hop across the street to an inexpensive Irish Pub I've never been to (because I wanted cheap noms and I had never been there and wanted to explore) but our awesome, awesome, awesome bartender who's name I can't for the life of me remember (Zack? Zachary?! Gahhh, I can't remember!) pretty much easily discovered one of my weakest culinary buttons...MAC AND CHEESE...with Parmesan, White Cheddar and GRUYERE. DAMNIT GRUYEREEEEEEEE, YOU'RE LIKE MY FAVORITE CHEESE EVERRRRRR!!! (and manchego, burrata, brie...you get the idea). Oh and it's made with Fusilli pasta. What a delightful sounding treat! We decided to split this amazing sounding concoction and I'M SO HAPPY WE DID. No regrets. Actually maybe one regret. That we didn't each order 2 orders so that we could each consume our own and then have more to eat throughout the night or the next day. I want to live on Hunter's mac and cheese and hands down it's the best I've ever had a bar/restaurant. Yes, it beat Beecher's ""World Best Mac n' Cheese"" and several BBQ places I've gone to. It was perfectly creamy, cheese, not overwhelming, all the cheeses and flavors worked together harmoniously to create a party in my mouth that I would hurt anyone right now to be able to throw. I mean, it's so, so, so, so AMAZING. GO. DO IT. NOW. Amazing. Upon eating this and freaking out at how life-changing this was, my life was really changed as I watched Ingrid douse her portion with Cholula sauce. Hot sauces scare me as I don't handle spicy things well. It's just not how I'm wired. However, this particular night was different. Must have been a full moon or some shizz because I thought it smelled delicious and decided to try a bit... It was then that all my insides imploded and my love affair with Cholula sauce began. I now drown things like pizza, pasta, EGGS (OMG CHEESY EGGS WITH CHOLULA SAUCE IS TRUTH!!), chicken, beef and anything I think is worthy of this not-so-spicy but high in vinegar content juice of the gods. SO delish and practically no calories?! The Mac and Cheese was already amazing to begin with, but with Cholula sauce mixed in I SAW GOD and he was life-changing. I hope to come back here soon for more mac and cheesey goodness and and to try the Honeybadger because well...you know...honey badger don't care :).",1
3441,9,4,12/7/2013,"In a neighborhood filled with all sorts of exotic food options, Hunter's has that solid salad/sandwich thing going that's perfect when you're not in the mood for ramen or cuban or French. The menu - It's simple, it's clean, and I'd eat anything off of it. Personally, I'd recommend the Chicken Salad sandwich, but don't attempt to do the healthy thing (aka side salad). The salad is just a pile of shredded lettuce with a blah dressing. Translation: get the fries. From the time I spoke to the hostess on the phone until the time I left brunch at Hunter's, I felt totally welcomed by the staff. Service with a smile is not something you see everyday; this place got it right.",1
3442,9,3,12/2/2013,"Good Portions, Great for groups, More restaurant Than bar with American and pasta.",1
3443,9,5,11/25/2013,"Came here on a Sunday night for the Chicken liver and bacon Pate, and let me tell you... it was well well worth the trip. Â The pate was SO delicious! Â Not to mention.... the bottles of wine were all half price on Sunday's #winning. The mac and cheese, also Very good. Â Creamy, flavorful, and nice crunchy texture on top. Â Def recommend this dish. And PLEASE please, whatever you do, do not forget to order some sides of BACON. Â Fried little cubes of fatty mellty delicious bacon. Â You will not regret this! Â Promise! The Service was spectacular.",1
3444,9,5,11/21/2013,"Service was FANTASTIC! Ordered the Angus burger and it was cooked to perfection. Juicy and delicious the pickled onions were great. My friends ordered the Mac and cheese with bacon and we enjoyed it as well. Great food! We ordered a special drink for their one year birthday/anniversary, and three of our party did not enjoy the drink and they HAPPILY took it off the menu. Wonderful! We will be back!!",1
3445,9,1,11/10/2013,"Came here tonight for dinner. We were a party of three and the waitress gave us a table close to the door but we asked for another table cause it was close to the bar. Then the waitress didn't give us enough time to choose what to eat and drink and she was too hyper so she stressed us out. We got a cauliflower soup as appetizer which was milky and we asked some bread which we got charged for. The wine was 50% off in fact it tasted like vinegar. We also ordered beef tartare with truffle fries, the meat was disgusting; very mushy and rubbery and the fries greasy. I'm never coming back.",1
3446,9,5,10/30/2013,"We stopped in here only because it was on Yelp's Smith Street Classic hit list, and boy am I glad Hunter's was on the list. We even came back after finishing the round! Upon entering, the casual and hip vibe immediately drew us in. It was fairly crowded for a weeknight but my friend Nathan and I found two stools at the bar. The bartenders and waitstaff were all dressed in cute Halloween themed hunter and animal costumes. So fun and laid back (and we got to steal their costume ideas shhh!). The bartenders were extra friendly and gave us their special Smith Street Classic contest cocktail. I don't remember what it was called, but I voted it the best cocktail and best bar! The drink did have Green Hook Gin and LeJay Creme de Cassis. Just ask for the special with that! Their other specialty cocktails reference hunters and animals (Katness Everdeen, Rusty Bulleit...). Since we still had other bars to go to, we reluctantly gave up our bar stools. Upon returning later, it was almost as if they reserved them for us LOL. Anyway, we had more cocktails and beer, and ordered amazing truffle fries and roasted Brussels sprouts with bacon. The sprouts were excellent! I had to take a photo for Yelp. I hated my mom's sprouts as a kid, but they weren't roasted like Hunter's. And I'm sure mom didn't add bacon. Last weekend friends moved in a block down Baltic, so we're coming back to Hunter's for sure and trying the dinner menu. Hope the food lives up to the bar standards! So far, Hunter's is my favorite Smith Street bar/restaurant, and it's already a ""classic.""",1
3447,9,5,10/30/2013,"I came here this past weekend for the Smith Street Classic cocktail. It was also my favorite cocktail of the event, The Eddie Brock: Gin, Pear Nectar, Orange Bitters, Lemon juice, Thyme Simple Syrup with a sprinkling of freshly cracked black pepper on top. Eddie Brock is actually a character, Venom, from the Amazing Spiderman Marvel comic series. But it doesn't just stop there with the nerdiness. Walking into the bar you think of hipster meets Big Buck meets I'm going to have a fancy elegant dinner/cocktail. I don't think I've ever met a better combination in my life. This may be my new favorite restaurant/bar. They do have an actual happy hour until 7pm weekdays and on Sundays they have half priced bottles of wine. Though, the specialty cocktails that are not a part of happy hour are the little touches that are made for geek boy wet dreams. As soon as I saw that there was a drink called 'Boba Fett', I knew I was sucked in. It's a trap! A great trap. They have a seasonal cocktail menu for Autumn and then some classic cocktails with inventive names. Like the Katniss Everdeen. C'mon! It was my halloween costume last year! Apple jack, st. germain, white lillet, peychaud's bitters. The Boba Fett tasted of cardamom and lemon. My friend's Katniss wasn't too over nuanced with just the right subtle combinations of flavors that it tasted like a delicate orchard grove. While waiting for our second cocktails to mix we decided to split their Macaroni and cheese entrÃ©e that is comprised of gruyere, cheddar, and parmesan cheeses. It is absolutely impeccable. The creamiest most decadent macaroni that I've had in ages, made with those spiral shaped noodles to suck up all of the sauce and layered with ground breadcrumbs for a perfectly browned top. Actually, super excited this is listed as a future Yelp Event because I already know I'll be coming back numerous times regardless.",1
3448,9,4,10/29/2013,Came here for a girls brunch and thoroughly enjoyed myself. There's nothing super unique about their menu and the prices are a tad higher than I like to pay for a Brooklyn brunch but the French toast stuffed with peanut butter was kind of amazing. My favorite part however was the fact that they take reservations online. Makes finding a place for 8 girls to have brunch during prime brunch time a breeze. I also appreciated the service which was impeccable. They knew the menu well and made excellent recommendations. They also didn't bat an eye when my husband showed up with a friend and our 1 year old kid Â and had a brunch of their own at another table naturally leading to us passing the kid back and forth between our tables. Hunter's is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.,1
3449,9,4,10/6/2013,Great.,1
3450,9,1,9/29/2013,"Went for brunch. Food was average. Service was terrible, coffee was atrocious.",1
3451,9,4,9/28/2013,"Came here for brunch with a friend and we both loved our meals. If you're into sweet stuff, get the Elvis. It was incredible! French toast that was super crispy on the outside and oozing with peanut butter on the inside. The place is average size for the area, so I can see how it may get packed. We went on a Sunday around 1 and were seated right away. The service was excellent and I'd definitely go back and check out their dinner menu as well.",1
3452,9,5,9/19/2013,"Stopped in here last night as my fave bartender was absent from across the way. So happy I did! Amazingly fresh and tasty food! My watermelon puree cocktail was perfect. Highly recommend the charred creamed corn and the truffle fries. My friend enjoyed his crab pasta and I loved the roasted tomato and eggplant soup. The bartender/waiter (definitely)/owner(maybe) hottie (if you're reading this, no creepo) was a delight as well. Mark of a good place is when you haven't even left yet but you're already excited to return!",1
3453,9,4,9/18/2013,"I came for brunch and was very pleased with the Roasted Pork Benedict and my Bloody Mary! The service was prompt and pleasant, and the portions were pretty good for the price. Â My friend had the pancakes and those were delicious from what I tried too! I would go again for brunch and try some more options, it's a cool place with very cute decor as well!",1
3454,9,5,9/16/2013,"YUM! Had a delicious brunch this past Sunday with some friends, and it was absolutely fabulous. Bloody Mary's are nice, as well as the Cucumber Mimosa! I had the Peanut Butter French Toast and it was hands down the best French Toast I've ever had - melts in your mouth! I will be back for that! The rest of the group enjoyed their food as well - I will definitely return!",1
3455,9,3,9/13/2013,"I went for brunch. The place looks lovely and the service is excellent. They serve pour over coffee, which is pretty cool. I has the omelette with goat cheese and tomatoes, which was a little blend if I want to be honest. The eggs benedict with roasted pork was OK. The French toast was also ok but the peanut butter inside made it a little too heavy to my taste.",1
3456,9,5,9/10/2013,"I am in love with Hunter's Cavatelli pasta. It has crab, summer peppers, and chili treviso. But what's most amazing about it, are the noodles. They literally melt in your mouth. Each noodle is individually made and it definitely comes out in the taste. Don't rush it, savor every morsel, you'll be upset when the experience is over. I also recommend the market lettuces. The way Hunters dresses their food is what makes it great. Their unique ability to pay attention to the little things creates the exceptional experience in a homey atmosphere. Hunters is like home but with the best food you'll ever eat, every day.",1
3457,9,4,9/8/2013,"My friend and I are suckers for anything labeled ""New American"" on Yelp. I'll admit that--as a vegetarian--the hunting theme made me wary, but the menu surprised me; it displayed a shocking number of enticing meatless options. In fact, I'm fairly certain the menu contained more vegetarian options than meaty ones. The menu incorporates unique and ""trendy"" ingredients like grilled kale, radishes, arugula, dill yogurt dressing, and so on. Hunter's possesses one of the most refreshing menus I've ever browsed! After much debate, my helpful and friendly waiter encouraged me to select the Eggplant and Zucchini ""Parm"" Sandwich (with side salad). As he promised, the sandwich contained no mozzarella and just a light powdering of parmesan (I don't like cheese, so this was important to me). This easily took the prize as the best ""eggplant parmesan"" I've ever had. I often find these sandwiches fried, artery-clogging, and trashy, but Hunter's version was light, fresh, and flavorful. The sandwich included a hearty ratio of eggplant and zucchini to bread, which was nice to see. The marinara sauce did most of the flavoring, and it really satisfied me. Furthermore, the bread was rustic and chewy. As for the side salad, I really enjoyed its simplicity. It was arugula tossed in a citrusy dressing. Divine, and the perfect complement to my sandwich. I'm so glad I gave this place a chance! I would absolutely recommend it to a friend, as well as come back for an encore meal.",1
3458,9,5,9/3/2013,"The wife and I were treated like royalty at this amazing spot. We had stopped by just for a cocktail and appetizer, but didn't want to leave when we began enjoying the eclectic music and delicious cocktails from Zach, the super friendly bartender. They touted that banana bread with Nutella, and it delivered. It's a really cute place and everything is clean and comfortable.",1

3460,9,3,8/28/2013,Good service. Good dinner entrees. I recommend the pork chop.,1
3461,9,1,8/23/2013,My friends pork was bloody on the inside - a big no no for pork. They were not very accountable either - they just threw it back on the fry pan for a bit longer. Not a great experience for us. The sting though - one of their minions responds on Yelp saying he was disrespectful to the chef and staff! I can assure you that was NOT the case at all. Bottom line: Will not return on principle and due to unsafe food practices. For others - don't order the pork!,1
3462,9,1,8/23/2013,Response to owner's comment: Your account of what happened is quite different from mine. Â For your information my entire table saw the pork was raw (pink on the inside) and insisted that I sent it back. The pork could have caused food poisoning. Â You don't have rare pork like you do beef. Â I was very polite to the staff about the situation and did not disrespect anyone. Â You on the other hand may want to display some respect. Â No threats were issued. Â I wrote my honest opinion on the experience at Hunters. Â I see from your response that the food is not the only thing that falls short on quality at this restaurant.,1
3463,9,4,8/14/2013,"Hunters! I picked this place solely on the name. My step dad loves to hunt and is not a big fan of NY, so I tried to make him feel at home. We tried a lot of the drinks and dishes. The pasta was my favorite. Super fresh!",1

3465,9,1,8/2/2013,"Had a very unpleasant experience here. Last night was my partner's birthday and he wanted to try a new place in neighborhood. We settled on Hunter's and went over for dinner on a Thursday night. We put in our orders for drinks and apps and everything was fine at this point. But then when my partner ordered the pork chop for his entree, the server told us they were out of it! There are only about 4 entrees on the menu so you'd think the server would have told us that up front. Anyway, that happens from time to time at any restaurant, but what really got to me was the lack of an apology when it happened. The server knew we were disappointed and she also knew it was my partner's birthday. We told her to cancel our app and that we just wanted the check. Our drinks hadn't even come at this point but 2 minutes later she brought over our drinks and hadn't even offered to cancel the order! She charged us full price for that--you'd think that they would at least take 1 drink off given that it was a special night and we had to leave because they failed to inform us of the menu limitations. I'm not trying to be cheap at all as it's not about the money, but the fact that this is a new restaurant in the area that we wanted to try on a special night. For those reasons, we felt like the server could have done a little more in terms of handling the situation in a way that would want to make us come back. We're definitely not planning to return because of it.",1
3466,9,3,7/29/2013,came for brunch. it's not a bad spot and is much less crowded than clover club across the street. i ordered the grilled kale salad & egg sandwich. both were tasty enough options but it was missing the hook to get me to come back again.,1

3468,9,5,7/17/2013,"We stumbled upon this place with the help of Yelp after schlepping around looking at apartments in the afternoon heat. We were tired, hot and depressed. Luckily, Hunter's was cool inside and inviting on a Sunday evening. The scene was relaxed and not too crowded. The service was friendly and quick in getting us seated and even allowed us to select a different table away from the door. We were impressed with the menu-the options were imaginative and in season. There were ingredients we've never heard of and interesting dishes in the appetizer, salad and entree sections. We wished we could have tried more! With the server's help we decided on the chicken liver and bacon mousse and grilled kale salad to start. Both were amazing! The chicken liver and bacon mousse comes with an impressive amount of smooth mousse and pickled veggies to go with. The bartender brought us more grilled bread without us having to ask for more-were we transported to a Danny Meyer restaurant? The grilled kale was delicious-the crispy artichoke slivers ingenious. It's a must try. For entrees I has the crab cavatelli (pasta made in house) and fiancee had the arctic char. We were both happy! The cavatelli packed some heat and the pasta had a nice, unctuous bite, plus the crab came in large, generous chunks. The arctic char had a perfectly crispy skin (nice technique chef!), and the creamed corn beneath it was rich with just enough tang to balance (maybe some sherry in the mix?) and the burst tomatoes were a nice touch! It's rare that an entire meal is spot on and almost makes up for all those crappy apartments we saw that day. On an additional note, they were running a special that night: half-priced bottles of wine. Also, earlier that summer, according to the server, they did ""surprise prix fixed"" meals to get feedback from diners on setting their summer menu. Seems like a fun and novel place to dine again and again. We can't wait to go back!",1
3469,9,3,7/14/2013,"Super nice staff, very attentive although short staffed. Limited menu but food was solid. Family friendly.",1
3470,9,4,6/23/2013,"This is a lovely place to have a meal. Â The poor waiter seemed to be having a rough night because they were understaffed, but despite all that he still stayed cheerful and was very attentive. I wasn't too crazily hungry, so for dinner I ordered an appetizer - red quinoa risotto with favas and peas (and a lovely, buttery crescenza cheese) and side of the peas, peas, peas! which was English, snow, and snap peas sauteed with pancetta and mint. Â As you can tell, I was on a spring kick with my fresh peas! Â I was very happy with what I had and thought it was pretty reasonably priced. I just have one question. Â What is it with everyone using ramps as a star ingredient lately? Â They were always the smelly green onion that accidentally got cut while mowing the grass that stunk up the whole yard, and now it's on every menu in Brooklyn. Â Oof.",1
963,9,5,6/20/2013,"you'd get a little nervous being the first two people in a resto on a saturday night, but we were well taken care of by the doting staff. I would recommend the fois gras mousse -- and before we'd even finished them the buttery toast squares were replenished -- and the venison pasta, which when they first opened was maligned by trusted reviewers, has come a long way, bunny. (too soon?) and was super tasty and delish. I uncharacteristically had a cab sauv on the rec of the server and it was quite lovely. for dessert, there was a rhubarb crumble situation that did not last long, if I recall, because it was scrumptious, but things are a little hazy. Absolutely looking forward to returning.",1
3471,9,4,6/13/2013,"Hunters was absolutely lovely. We did the ""Roulette"" menu where for $35 the chef has you try out dishes that the house is considering for addition to their seasonal menu. This selection changes every couple of days. We were really pleased with the salmon/avocado appetizer, the sautÃ©ed pork chops, and the poached peach dessert. To top it off the staff was great. Our waiter Matthew was awesomely engaging as well as efficient. We felt like instant regulars as we also received pleasant, unrushed visits from the owner and the chef himself. You can sit out front in the airy bar section or slip into the cozier dining room in the back which accommodates groups quite well. Tasty cocktail selection too. We gambled and won! I'll be back.",1
3472,9,4,6/7/2013,"Great atmosphere, delicious cocktails and when I went last night, free wine tasting until 9! Â can't beat it. Â didn't eat but def would go back for drinks.",1
3473,9,5,6/6/2013,"Walked in a few days before a saturday night 1st anniversary dinner, and the friendly bartender made sure I got the table and time right for Saturday night. Â Got there and table was ready, good service throughout, fast drink service, apps and dinner came out without a hitch. Â Tunes seemed like they were ripped from my collection. Lighting was good. Decent atmosphere and crowd...not too busy but still had some good energy. Â My roasted chicken plate was the best $20 entree I've had in a while. Â Vegetarian girlfriend liked her mushroom pie. Â Sauteed Kale salad was delicious and ample. G-friend will probably go back and get a few apps and sides...and I don't see not getting the chicken again. Damn good.",1
3474,9,4,6/5/2013,really have enjoyed a few nice nights out here. the menu is consistently changing and staying fresh and seasonal. as is the cocktail list. great beer options. i would recommend the soup and toast of the day for a nice late afternoon snack.,1
3475,9,4,6/3/2013,"What a lovely spot to spend unhurried hours on a Sunday evening catching up with a dear friend! Half-price bottles of wine make that a great night to visit; if you're not already intrigued by the slightly rustic farmhouse-meets-lodge interior and jovial atmosphere, the brief but thoughtful wine list and dining menu should pull you in. And with window-walls open to the sidewalk on Smith, what little breeze there was pre-thunderstorm wisped in to create refreshing hints of al fresco dining. Seasonal sourcing and all that, but thoughtfully done and nicely executed, with small plates mostly ranging a bit over $10 and entrees closer to $20. We shared the wild boar pÃ¢tÃ© (a special), and I followed that with a beet salad - made new with its dill-yogurt sauce bed. All quite tasty! Where Hunter's clearly shines, aside from service, is through the cocktail menu. I'm a wine drinker at heart, so it takes a great cocktail description to tempt me, and almost every single one on this list did so. I settled on the Belle Starr, and my friend had the Ol' Lilly, which may be the most perfectly simple yet refreshing summer cocktail I've ever tasted. Perfectly balanced, light yet vibrant....The entire menu looked to move in that direction, with simplicity and restraint knitted together with creativity. It's hard to stand out in Brooklyn these days, but if Hunter's keeps being a welcoming spot to get good food and a great drink at decent prices, that's a meaningful way to create a niche nevertheless. Here's to another Ol' Lilly....",1
3476,9,1,5/20/2013,"I am so confused by this high yelp rating. I've been living in/around this neighborhood for five years and frequent Smith Street restaurant for brunch, and that was definitely the worst meal I've had. I felt like I was at a 24-hour diner or something-- the homefries were yellowy and barely recognizable, and the ""thinly sliced pork shoulder"" on the eggs benedict was more like a tough, slightly grizzly porkchop. The huevos were fine but tasteless and not a lot of food for the money. Every egg on every dish was undercooked (runny whites), except for one ""poached"" egg on the benedict that was fully hard boiled. Nice staff, drinks looked good, decor was fine. But the food...",1
3477,9,3,5/19/2013,"After rock climbing at Brooklyn Boulders, I went here for brunch. I had Roast Pork Benedit and it was pretty good. Their home fries were seasoned well that I didn't need any ketchup. I thought their roast pork was a little dried but overall it's was good.",1
3478,9,4,5/18/2013,"The pastas here are the real highlight - and I like how they change seasonally. Â The cocktails too here are quite serious -- on par with some of the other neighborhood spots like Clover Club and Battersby. Â So, if Clover Club is a bit too full for you, Hunter's is definitely a good fall-back option for serious drinks -- the bar area is pretty lively as the night progresses. Â My one main critique is that the vibe, generally, is a bit too affected - it's trying too hard to be Brooklyn and I don't think it really has to be. Â This is really something minor, because I'm happy to have a quality spot like Hunter's in my neighborhood.",1
3479,9,4,5/17/2013,"After seeing the Knicks get destroyed I needed some cocktails in my system. Heard Hunters was a spot to check out if you find yourself on the north side of Smith and don't want to deal with the ripping, clawing and killing to get a drink at Clover Club. Â  These drinks were made real well. Excellent job. Loved the Honey Badger, that drink did not give a fuck! It's pretty badass. The Handsome Hound was top notch as well. My date got the Katniss Everdeen. Now I'm not opposed to bars that name drinks after movie characters, but c'mon. Would love to come back here again and try some of the grub. I shall return.",1
3480,9,4,5/10/2013,"My boyfriend says Hunter's has the best burger this the neighborhood, and my steak tartare was the best I've had in a long time. Â The service is super friendly, too.",1
3481,9,4,5/5/2013,"Really, really love Hunter's. I've been here with a big group and at the bar with a pal right before closing. Both times the food and service were great. Def as good or better than Char no 4 and Clover Club, which frequently have long waits. Standouts include their well crafted and strong cocktails, addictive kale salad, mussels, pappardelle with rabbit, whole fish, and the ricotta donuts for dessert.",1
3482,9,5,4/29/2013,"I love this place. Â I've been twice and both times both the food and the drinks have been spot on. Â I went for a quick dinner before my birthday party and the bartender was really nice and sent over a round of champagne. Â  All the food was fabulous. Â We got the steak tartar as well as the fluke crudo for appetizers. Â Both were really delicious, but not too filling. Â For an entree I got the whole trout with a mustard sauce. Â Despite not being that hungry by then I ate the whole thing. Â My friends got the rabbit pasta and the lamb and both were very happy with their meal. Â I will definitely make this a staple of the neighborhood.",1
2061,9,4,4/29/2013,"I came here on accident since the place my 10 year old ""little"" and I were planning on going to was closed. I'm glad that we got here though. Even though the place was incredibly busy, we were able sit right away. Although the kid's menu was pricey (cheapest was $8), my little got the kid's burger with fries and I got the roast pork benedict, which I had to get! I love 2 things - pork and eggs benedict. I also ordered some black tea, which I believe was Harney and Sons? When we got the food, my first thought was ""that burger cannot be a child's burger"" and then she told me there was non-ketchup sauces on it but she ate it so I was fine. I ate my whole eggs and pork benedict although I""m conflicted about how I feel about it. The pork was delicious and the benedict was as well but I don't know how I like it together. Anyways, we got the check and of course they charged us for the adult burger which was $6 more. They happily changed it which was awesome considering we did not order the adult burger. It was a cute brunch place with exposed brick and lots of sunlight, I definitely would come back again.",1
3483,9,5,4/28/2013,"I've been here twice now, for brunch and dinner, and I really like it! Â I can't say anything bad about this place. Â The food is quite delicious and creative. Â I definitely recommend the special toast, which changes daily (maybe weekly?). Â Basically, it's a piece of toast with some sort of spread or topping, and it's delicious. Â Also, the treviso salad is one of the best salads I've had in a long time. Â For dinner, definitely get the roast chicken. Â Also, it's definitely vegetarian friendly for those that swing that way. The cocktails are done very well. Â I had a their special last night, which had whiskey, pineapple bitters, and a few other things -- sort've like a tropical Manhattan. Â Awesome. Â Also the Katniss Everdeen cocktail (yes, like Hunger Games), which is made with applejack, is great. Â I also recommend the Handsome Hound, which is basically their take on a Manhattan. Â It's got rye and corn whiskeys, a couple different types of bitters (including whiskey barrel bitters), sweet vermouth, and brandied cherries that offer a great punch of sweet to counteract the bitter. Â For brunch, the bloody mary has a lot of pretty awesome toppings, like a giant piece of ham (prosciutto or mortadella I think). The service is also good. Â The waiters and waitresses are very friendly and make nice recommendations for what to order. Â Also, the bartender takes the time to talk and say hello, even when they're busy, which is great. Â Brunch service is great. Â Dinner service was fine too, perhaps a bit slow in waiting for our entrees, but whatever. Finally, the ambiance is definitely Brooklyn-casual. Â Low key, but you definitely know you're at a popular restaurant. Â Great vibe for the neighborhood, and they take reservations! Â I would definitely go back.",1
3484,9,4,4/22/2013,"Took a large party of seven there last night for cocktails and dinner. The staff was great. We had a wonderful time and will be back. Loved the Grizzly Adam and Rattlesnake cocktail. The chicken liver, kale salad, and the pappardelle were great. I also loved the fried ricotta dumplings for dessert. Reasonably priced menu and good size portions.",1
3485,9,4,4/21/2013,"Great new spot on Smith Street. I agree with others that the menu is large enough to give you some nice options, but small enough not to be overwhelming. I, for one, appreciated that the menu had flair (e.g. red quinoa risotto, which was tasty by the way) but wasn't too ""fancy pants."" Drinks were good as well. Also like that you can make reservations - so much nicer than playing the table roulette that you find alot in places like this. As for the roast chicken - yum. Loved it. Hubby got the lamb and enjoyed it. Truffle fries were just okay, although that didn't mean we didn't gobble them down, just that they weren't ""special"" - think we'll just get the regular fries next time around. Good wine (we shared a bottle of cabernet). One complaint: service is a bit on the slow side, they have a busy bar and we had to settle up the bill for the drinks before we could be seated but that was really a minor nitpick.",1
3486,9,3,4/19/2013,Went shortly after it opened was pretty unremarkable but decent service and nice atmosphere.,1
3487,9,5,4/18/2013,"I've been a handful of times, mostly for lunch. With so few places open for lunch on Smith, I'm always surprised why this place isn't full during the day. The food is incredible. I've had (and loved) the burger, the crispy fish sandwich, the kale salad, and more. But the truffle fries are uh-MAZ-ing. I can't not get them. Never disappointed. The staff is consistently friendly and real. That's hard to find! And the cocktail list, as many have pointed out before me, is freakin' cool. I mean, the honey badger? It's like a bad ass whiskey lemonade. Yum. I'm intentionally giving this place five stars because it is well-deserved. I have read these ridiculous one-star reviews and let's be honest, some people are nuts. Some people use Yelp reviews to fill the webisphere and social media with negativity because they are unhappy about life. As this place is new, I'm sure there is room for improvement, but I want the world to know Hunter's is quite the gem on Smith St. So, you better go.",1
3488,9,4,4/14/2013,"Had my birthday brunch here and it was amazing - the drinks were strong, the pancakes were delicious! Came back and the pancakes weren't as fluffy as they were before but their burger & other things on the menu are very good as well. Cute, quiet place!",1
3489,9,1,4/14/2013,"The food here is just so so, and the portions are small and very over priced. Â My friends stopped for a taco after just to feel like they'd eaten. Â The service is painfully slow,but the most egregious thing about this place is they charge you for ice. Â  Let me repeat, if you order a drink with ice you will have that added to your bill! Which is ironic because the best part of my Hunter experience was that they were very good about replacing our water that we kept going through while waiting for our meal.",1
3490,9,5,3/31/2013,"Had an incredible dinner last night. Went with a group of 8, between us we tried almost everything on the menu. We tried nothing short of excellent.",1
3491,9,5,3/28/2013,"I initially gave this place a harsh review (below), but I've since been back several times since, and they've drastically improved. This is now one of my favorite places in the 'hood... They must've just been having.... Growing pains.... Ya see?! First impressions aren't ALWAYS everything! +++++++++++++++++++++++++ Pretty underwhelming. I came for an early Sunday dinner with my family (5 of us in total). The restaurant was about half full with plenty of servers on staff... Which is typical of a restaurant at that time and day. Problem is, the service was incredibly slow. Like, scary slow. The servers didn't seem rushed or short staffed. But rather like they had been smoking pot in the back and had no clue what was going on. Everything was painfully slow. For example: Twenty minutes after we had finished our appetizers, our waitress returned to the table to finally clear those plates. And asked what we wanted for dessert. Ummm... Let's get through through the main course and see how we feel first. Forty minutes later, our main courses came out. You get the idea. And while we're talking about the food.... It was... Just okay. The menu items seemed inventive and we were excited to try a few new things. But the food was just... Bland. And, like I said, underwhelming. You'd be better served (no pun intended) skipping this spot and trying out any of the other (better!) New American or Italian places around the neighborhood. It's a shame, really, I had such high hopes for this place. Ahh... On to the next.",1
3492,9,5,3/25/2013,"Hunter's is one of the best meals I've had in a long time! We walked in on Friday at around 8pm with no reservations and didn't even have to wait. The old space is charming and cozy, and the menu is just big enough without being too limiting nor too overwhelming. Drinks are pretty good, and they are the only place I've found so far that makes Fernet Branca mixed drinks! We ordered both pastas, a rabbit and fava bean papardelle and a mint, pistachio and ricotta ravioli with fresh sweet peas. Delicious! Such unique and complementary flavors. For the main we shared the lamb leg and truffle fries. The lamb was so fork tender and melted in your mouth. Dessert was sweet ricotta fritters (like a fluffy donut) and strawberry rhubarb crisp. The ricotta fritters were divine! As for the rhubarb crisp, I'm not much of a rhubarb person since I find it too tart, but the crisp was delicious. I'll definitely be back!",1
3493,9,3,3/25/2013,"This is one of those rustic looking hipster places, where they've got great cocktails and a fantastic looking menu. Problem is, everything reads better than it tastes. There were some seriously stupendous sounding items on the menu. Nothing was bad, but nothing was great. Not sure how long they've been open, maybe they're just getting on their feet...but I really have see no reason to return. I mean, come on. Rabbit pappardelle should blow ya mind!",1
3494,9,3,3/19/2013,"Please stay open- good vibe for the neighborhood Brunch Staff - nice and answered questions about the menu Bloody Mary tasted great with a loaded skewer of bites on it- The special smoked turnip soup was crazy good- really balanced, interesting and loaded with flavor. My beau's roast pork benedict was allegedly tasty and definitely a dainty portion ( for a brunch entree ) The grilled Kale salad on paper was perfect but on the plate was a big mess - I honestly hope it was the day off for the chef or something because it was a big ol mess of soggy cous cous and artichoke with a wreath of pan burnt kale with blobs of dressing sitting on top- should have taken a picture. There is other stuff on the menu that sounds great. room is comfortable bloody mary repeatable I'd come back for the soup!",1
3495,9,4,3/18/2013,This place has lots of potential and is very cute. Good atmosphere and feel inside. I think the breakfast menu needs a couple more options.. We had two orders of eggs benedict that fell short. Eggs were completely overlooked and the pork was fatty and very chewy. I hate to say it but it was a real dissapointment. There was also almost no hollandaise sauce but I got more and that helped. Everything else at the table was great. I didn't have any coffee but those who did said it was excellent. I think this place will be great once they get everything down.,1
3496,9,4,3/16/2013,Came in for brunch today and left very impressed. Â The pancakes were out of control good. Â Their seasonal omelet was cheddar and sweet potato which was unique and delicious. Â Washed all of this down with an awesome bloody mary. Â Service was friendly. Â Lots of competition on Smith St but this ranks high on the list.,1
3497,9,1,3/15/2013,"Not worth your time or money. Brooklyn is full of good restaurants, especially in this neighborhood. This place is mediocre in basically all respects. We got the chicken liver appetizer, which was just okay. Honestly! Anytime you're producing a chicken liver dish that is JUST OKAY, you should throw in the towel. It's like making a bad burger, which they also managed to do. For my main dish, I had the agnolotti which were cloyingly sweet, and tasted like they were made with canned pumpkin. It was such a disappointment, just a one-note, punch in the mouth. No one else at our table was too impressed with their dishes either. The one bright spot in the meal was the kale salad. It was good, but certainly wouldn't warrant a repeat visit. Although we had a reservation, it took them a full 30 minutes past our reserved time to seat us. It was absolutely ridiculous. We could see the waitstaff making half-assed, sluggish attempts to put the tables together, but it was clear that they were just totally incompetent. Incidentally, the cocktail that I had while we were waiting was terrible. I think it was the Van Helsing. Then when we were FINALLY seated, in a table back in the main room, which was incredibly dark and loud, we were overcame with heat. We complained (nicely, at least at first) multiple times about the heat and absolutely nothing was done. The waitress said, ""Yeah, it is hot, huh?"" and then wandered off. We were all so uncomfortable we didn't stay for dessert.",1
3498,9,4,3/11/2013,"First of all, Pete D is spot on that going to a good new restaurant in Brooklyn with the ability to make a reservation is beyond pleasurable and civilized. Â Just that fact alone, give the Hunter's owners much kudos and starts this review with 2*s. Besides reservations, there are many things that Hunter's does correctly. Â Its a small, appropriately priced menu, good drink list, and cozy lighting/ atmosphere. Â Food was great with surprisingly larger than expected portions - between three of us, we shared the chicken liver mousse (win!), meats (only ok), grilled kale (love puffed chickpeas), papardelle (pretty standard boar ragu but still tasty), mushroom pot pie (interesting to try) and roasted chicken (well executed and love the sweet potato mash). Unfortunately, service was a little off-putting. Â The waiter almost brought down the whole experience because he was so actor-y and overzealous. Â He had a fake affected voice in his service - fine, a lot of waiters pull this. Â However, he then tried to sell us a bottle of pinot for dinner, when we asked how much - $150 (eh... you know this isn't Le Bernadin Brooklyn, right?). Â Overly into pouring our white wine as well, so much so that he poured it all out, then immediately asked us if we wanted another bottle. Â Nope, we have huge FULL glasses of white, thanks. Overall, great. Â Waiters should dial it down two notches so that services matches the look and feel of the restaurant, but def worth repeat business.",1
3499,9,4,3/7/2013,"Hunters is a nice addition to the neighborhood! Â Drinks are delicious - i'd come back for a cocktail anytime. I think we both had the Rusty Bulleit cocktail and it went down super easy. Â Ordered an app of olives which were... well, olives. Â But warmed up just right and very good. We also got the special toast of the day which was carmelized onions and goat cheese on crostini, it was delish. Â For my main I got the hefty grilled kale salad. Â it came with a mustard-y Â dressing which was slightly too sharp for my liking... but it still was delicious. Â It was served over a squash patty that was equally good. Â BF got the mushroom potpie - it was amazing. Â So flavorful. Â Note: Â the patry topping was literally that, a pastry topping. Â The pot-pie wasn't baked within the pastry. Â That means two things: Â 1) Â The pastry topping was perfectly flaky and delicious, not soggy at all Â 2) Â it may not be the pot-pie you remember as a kid... but boy is it good. Â Server seemed a bit uninterested but the service itself was fine. Â Place is getting some good press and got super crowded so hopefully it doesn't become like many other places in Brooklyn: delicious but not worth the hassle. Â For the time being though, no hassle here.",1
3500,9,5,3/4/2013,"I was there with a group of 8 on a rainy Tuesday night and totally loved it. My brother who's from brooklyn had told me about Hunter's and it didnt disappoint. Just the type of restaurant that I miss now living in SF... A+ food at very reasonable prices. And fun/cool -- brick wall, lots of wood... tons of personality and a great bar area. Can't wait to head back on my next visit.",1
3501,9,4,3/4/2013,"I really enjoyed Hunter's. Â The service was extremely friendly and helpful. Â Everyone said hello to greet us when we walked in and everyone said good bye on our way out. Â The boy and I each started with their house specialty cocktails - mine was a smokey tequila number and his was some sort of bourbon. Â Yummy. Â We each then had the butter lettuce salad which was DELICIOUS. Â Not overdressed, yumm almonds and super crunchy and seemingly homemade croutons. Â The portion was also on the larger side, which I welcomed. Â He had the burger for his main which he deemed ""average."" Â I had the sweet potato gnocchi which was outstanding. Â The sauce was all sorts of creamy and salty. Â I absolutely loved it. Â The caramelized onions added a sweetness. Â It was great. Â We will be back to try more!",1
3502,9,5,3/3/2013,"The food here was incredible! Super fresh, and perfectly cooked. The chicken liver mousse was fantastic, with a hint of smoky bacon in it. I also loved the mushroom pot pie; the vegetables were so well cooked (still with some bite to it), and the crust was nice and flaky. Beyond the food, the atmosphere was really cute, and comfortable. I also really appreciated the fact that they take your number and text you when your table is ready if there is a wait.",1
3503,9,4,2/26/2013,"Really great place to enjoy a good meal in the neighborhood and good conversation, without a long wait! I definitely appreciate the effort with their cocktail selection! Â Started off with their Katness Everdeen cocktail - a novelty, but still very lovely! Â The BF had the Rusty Bulleit. Â Both cocktails were well made. Â I'd definitely come back here to grab drinks! Â  For apps, we tried their special for the evening: roasted bone marrow that you had to spoon out the goodness onto some toasty bread (which they offered to replenish!). Â It was deliciously paired with a light citrus type salad that cut through the richness of the bone marrow-yumzzz. For entrees, Â I had the roasted chicken with brussel sprouts and maple sweet potato mash. Â Chicken was absolutely juicy and exceeded my expectations. Â The serving was quite large too - I definitely had leftovers to bring home! Â As for the brussel sprouts and sweet potato mash, they were good and an interesting pairing, but the chicken was definitely the star of the dish. The BF had the bass Â with barley and broccoli rabe, and ""it was pretty damn good"". But the dish that I still think about, is the creamed kale. so creamy, perfect texture, topped with fried breadcrumbs?! This was my absolute fave of the night!!!!!! I really enjoyed dining here and is a nice addition to the neighborhood!",1
3504,9,4,2/25/2013,"Let me just say this: It's truly a pleasure to be able to make a reservation for two at a new joint in Brooklyn. I understand that perhaps it can cut into profits because there are some degenerates out there who view reservations as back-up plans that they may or may not decide to honor half an hour after the appointed time. However, I appreciate the fact that I can reserve a table at Hunter's on a Saturday night for me and my lady friend, and I promise I will hold up my end of the bargain and show up on time to eat and drink so much that it will ruin my girlish figure. In addition, I like how you have spaced your tables in such a way that I am not jammed next to other folks who would be forced to endure my conversational prowess (or lack thereof). So thank you, Hunter's, for the civilized manner in which you conduct your business, out of place as it may be here in Brooklyn. I would also like to thank you for an excellent menu. No new ground is being broken here, but of all the starters and salads and pastas and mains, I would happily order any of the options you've provided. Of course, as I've only been here once so far, I ordered a burger. Speaking of, I would like to thank you for a delicious, actually medium-rare burger, as well as that salad of beets and feta, and the gnocchi which we devoured as well. I would thank you for not naming a cocktail after a character from The Hunger Games, but you let me down there. Then again, I recognized the reference, so who am I to cast stones? In any case, I thank you for a quality meal in a pleasant environment, and I hope you stick around for long enough for me to become a regular.",1
3505,9,4,2/23/2013,"Came here with a party of 8. Great service and the waitress had a great personality and was very kind and patient with us as was the rest of the staff. The beef tartare was spectacular and even though everyone at the table was sharing their appetizers, I only (with a few mumbles and grumbles) gave up a bite of mine. The sweet potato gnocci was very good. I felt like the bacon in it was incredibly chewy though, lots of fatty pieces...Overall very yummy though and perfect comfort food for a cold evening!",1
3506,9,1,2/19/2013,I was there on Valentines Day and ordered the rib dinner. What I found in the potatoes under the piece of rib was A very large staple. I am very very disappointed in this restaurant. Â I would not recommend this restaurant to any one. We did get a 20 Â  Percent discount. It did not help how I feel about this place Catherine Amato This should be reported to the FDA,1
3507,9,3,2/15/2013,food was great. Â my main disappointment was with the service. Â it could be way sharper and professional. Â  1. Â if guests order another bottle of wine clear the old wine glasses. at one point I had three glasses (and a water glass in front of me) Â not chic. Â  2. DO NOT remove all plates until everyone is finished. Â this isn't goddamn olive garden. Â  Â  3. can I get a clean fork and knife after an appetizer instead of the waiter taking both my dirty fork and knife off my plate with his fist and slamming it down on the table. Â not elegant. check out battersby down the street (if you can get in) Â hunters should poach some of their servers.,1
3508,9,5,2/15/2013,"Finally got back here again for another meal. 5 stars yet again. The quail dish from the Valentine's Day menu was absolutely amazing, as was the venison tartare. Service was exemplary.",1
3509,9,4,2/15/2013,"Came here last night for the Valentine's Day prixe fixe. Â My husband and I live in Brooklyn Heights and have been to many of the Smith Street restaurants but missed this one for some reason. Â  We were seated and not given menus. Â We had to fix our own wobbly table and steal some menus off another table. Â oofa. Â From the time we sat down to the time the server actually came over to us and gave us water, it had been 15 minutes and we noticed about 4 or 5 servers walking around and then disappearing in the back for several moments at a time together (maybe there was something going on back there?) - not off to a good start, I'm already thinking of things to report here on Yelp (I'm slightly crazy). But when she finally came back for our orders, she served us champagne and was happy to answer all our questions with a smile. Â After that the service picked up and we were served each course pretty quickly. Â appeased. I started with the root vegetable risotto which was seriously heavenly. Â I think it was made with brown rice too. Â My husband had the venison and beet tartar which he loved. Â For a main I went with the pan roasted cod with lentils and root vegetables, and my husband enjoyed the grilled marinated quail. Â The cod was delicious and I enjoyed the fried lemon but the lentils were filling (or maybe it was the risotto?) and I didn't finish the dish. Â The quail marinade was sweet and the polenta was amazing, I kept stealing forkfuls to my husband's dismay. Â For dessert I went with the passion fruit panna cotta since I'm a giant fan, and my husband got the chocolate pavlova. Â I will say, the panna cotta stole the show while the chocolate pavlova stuck to our teeth and was just ""meh."" The drinks here are pretty incredible too - we sipped on a strong Handsome Hound and a sweet Katniss Everdeen throughout our meal and thought they were perfect. We walked away perfectly happy with the meal and promising to return, although next time we'll wear jeans since we felt slightly overdressed (very casual place).",1
3510,9,5,2/14/2013,Had a great dinner at the very attractive Hunters of Brooklyn. The menu was diverse and the food delicious. Â Every appetizer was delicious but the mussels and the grilled kale salad were excellent. Â  Our entrees also were wonderful with the parpadelle with boar ragu and the roasted cod leading the pack. Â And whatever you do don't miss the maple sweet potato mash as a side dish and the riccota fritters for dessert. We were four and loved our dinner. Â Our friends were locals (Brooklyn Heights) and we were from Long Island and made the trip in just to eat at Hunters. Â So worth the drive. Â Can't wait to spread the word. Â Can't wait to come back!!! Bon appetit everyone!,1
3511,9,4,2/11/2013,"On a freezing cold night after Winter Storm Nemo, I was craving some hearty, comfort food and Hunters served just that! We started with the Stinky Cheese: it was good, I do love stinky cheese, especially paired with honey and freshly toasted bread! Their cocktail list was very tempting, but I stuck with a glass of cab(can't not have a glass of wine with my cheese). For Mains: I ordered the sweet potato gnocchi. It was good-- not the best I've ever had but definitely hit the spot with chunks of bacon and goat cheese fondue. I was a little disappointed with my main for a few reasons. First, the menu states that the gnocchi is house-made and I was anticipating it to taste fresh, however the gnocchi sort of tasted Â as though perhaps they made it a while ago, frozen and then was just boiled today. I had asked for my dish without the caramelized onions and it still came loaded with pungent onions which really overpowered the goat cheese fondue. Overall, the dish itself did hit the spot and has a lot of potential. I also ordered a side of the maple sweet potato mash which was delicious-- the sweetness was perfectly balanced. My fiance went with the organic roasted chicken which I had a few bites of-- although moist, it really was far too salty. For dessert: sweet ricotta fritters- delicious fried Â balls of ricotta cheese dipped in dulce de leche- can't go wrong! Very reminiscent of a fall festival in New England. Overall, I think Hunters had a great selection of hearty, soul-warming winter meals. I look forward to seeing what they have in store for spring.",1
3512,9,4,2/11/2013,"Very solid American food! Â As others mention, a reservation will not guarantee a timely seating. Â We had 7:30 reservations, sat closer to 8 - but the host handled it well so we weren't too bothered by it. Â I will say during the 20 minute wait, we were barely able to get a drink from the bar. Â The bartender seemed very scattered and came back to confirm our order 3 times before we actually got the drinks. Hunter's food is solid - not the best I've had but a very good local option. Â The grilled kale salad was delicious (not a kale fan usually). Â The steak tartare was below average. Â I've gotten the roast chicken each time I've been and it is very very good. Â My boyfriend got the mushroom pot pie and immediately regretted not going with the burger. Â The pot pie was good but is better suited for a large side dish than an $18 main course. The cocktails are generally very good, again not great. They are very alcohol forward, which I normally prefer, but they lack the subtle flavors that usually come out in cocktails like that. The best part is definitely the atmosphere - cozy, lodgy, lively, and warm. We'll definitely be back to Hunter's.",1
3513,9,4,2/6/2013,"Had such a great dinner experience here. The bartender was really informative about drink options, our waitstaff was friendly, the atmosphere was nice but a little to dark to read the hard to read menu. But the food, wow. Grilled Kale salad to start was really good. Our entrees were superb, I had Sweet Potato Gnocchi with onions bacon and goat cheese fondue, delicious. My friends both had the Pork in milk and honey which was perfectly cooked and so flavorful. Enjoyed the Ricotta Fritters with dulche de leche for dessert. Overall a great meal, can't wait to go here again.",1
3514,9,5,2/3/2013,"Excellent for a no hassles, great plate of home made pasta with wild boar and mushrooms. The place is sweet, the staff super nice, the prices gentle, and they really care. The bread that comes out is grilled first, but warm and delicious . How many hard rolls or cold bread have you gotten?",1
3515,9,4,2/2/2013,Great food! Lovely ambience and attentive waitstaff. Â Will be returning soon!,1
3516,9,1,1/31/2013,"1. Â 7:30 reservation, seated at 8:10. Â We sat at the bar when we arrived, at 8 pm, I went to the bathroom and there were 4 2 seat tables that could have easily been put together to accommodate our party of 4. Â But we waited 40 minutes for them to figure this out. Â  2. We were there last night, when it was easily 50+ degrees outside. Â The restaurant was easily 90+ degrees. Â Our party was overheated, the waitstaff was very obviously sweating. Â We complained 3 times. Â The manager said he would take care of it once and never came back. 2 hours of sweating is not the best atmosphere Upon leaving when I spoke to the manager, these are the excuses: I.m overheated too I have no control over the heating I did adjust the thermostat (I was seated facing this devise, he came nowhere near it) I couldn't turn the fan up to the next setting because I have no control over it. Â  Food wise? Nothing terribly exciting, Â All the food available here has been done better and at better prices & service at Clover Club & Savoia.",1
3517,9,5,1/31/2013,"I took my mother here. She grew up in the neighborhood and is vehemently opposed to ""fancy yuppie shit"" as she so eloquently calls the overflow of fancy, overpriced and small-portioned restaurants in Carroll Gardens. She narrowed her eyes over the menu, which had been typed up with size negative four font. She rolled her eyes at me. They were out of the wine she wanted. She stared at the waitress incredulously, but I think that was an accident as her brain was just trying really hard to process having to make another decision. She's very indecisive. Once the food came, she chewed with raised eyebrows. She pointed at her dish accusingly, face lit up with a childlike glee, and made an announcement: ""Wow, this great. I like this. I like this!!"" The pickiest woman in the world loves this place. We go back all the time. The prices are reasonable, too. Also the waitress is cute. And their Bloody Marys come with a bunch of k00l vegetablez that will make you cum(pletely satisfied).",1
3518,9,4,1/27/2013,"Solid New American food. Nothing tried blew me away, but nothing disappointed either. Â  The chicken liver mousse with bacon is as one might expect--very good-- and served on delicious bread. Â The steak tartare was just ok alone, but on top of the same delicious bread was, well, delicious. The grilled kale salad was yum, and I usually don't like kale. The burger was respectable and smokey, though the fries were a bit lacking. A dining companion's parpardelle with boar ragu was reported as quite good, as was the roasted chicken. The ricotta fritters for desert were tasty, but didn't change my life. Â Oh, and a delicious cocktail with apple jack, elderflower and bitters. Good service, nice space and vibe. Â  It's getting tough differentiating all the new New American restaurants in Brooklyn and the competition is fierce. Â But Hunter's holds its own.",1
3519,9,5,1/25/2013,"Hot damnnn this restaurant is out of this world delish! I was blown away by their salad, burger, pasta, and side dishes! Seriously, I haven' t had a bad dinner here yet and I doubt I will ever come across one. The service is also spectacular -- my server's name is Kelly and he was so attentive throughout the entire meal; he was also very knowledgeable about the menu and cocktails! The atmosphere also had a fantastic vibe -- not sure how to describe it but it felt like a sophisticated-hipster joint (if that makes sense!?)... For more details on what I ate at Hunter's you can click here: allamix.com/2013/01/21/hâ€¦",1
3520,9,3,1/20/2013,It's nice to see something new in the way of brunch. The roast pork Benedict was exactly that. Very tasty. The only thing I missed was a little salad along with it. The service is very friendly. The Bloody Mary was perfect. By itself would be a 5. The turnip soup was amazing. That alone would be a reason to come back. I would recommend this place for sure.,1
3521,9,4,1/7/2013,"My new fave local--the ambiance is warm and inviting, as is the staff (particularly my man Liam behind the bar & the manager Steve). Â A simple menu full of yummy things that I want to put in my mouth, and many options for vegetarians (no cause for alarm--I'm only a part-time vegetarian). Â The wine list is short, but with all good options. Â This is just a cozy place where you want to come and hang out. And you know I won't complain about 1/2 bottles of wine on Sundays, never not me.",1
3522,9,5,1/6/2013,"Hunter's represents everything great about Brooklyn food: fresh ingredients, simple dishes well prepared, curated cocktail list, and healthy (but not bloated) selection of whiskeys. Every dish I've had has been great (steak tartare, gnocchi, toast with smoked trout, and more!) and the staff is helpful and courteous. Could not ask for a finer night out -- whether it's a drink with a friend or a romantic dinner. GO TO HUNTER'S!",1
3523,9,4,1/6/2013,"Wow, I really appreciate what Hunter's is contributing to the neighborhood, and wished I had gone sooner. The environment is pretty much no frills but with some cute accents (old fashioned by hand juicer, old school radio, some chalkboard painted wall segments where they write specials) I was there on a Sunday and while they didn't seem to have many staff members working I felt the staff was friendly and attentive. Their cocktail list looks awesome and I can't wait to try a bunch of those concoctions. They take a fresh (house made pastas for example) seasonal (I caught the winter menu), local (they tell you where the meat and spirits hail from) approach while still being creative with their concepts. It is quite impressive to see both put into action. I think it is reasonably priced for what they are offering (organic meat, yay!) I had the seasonal omelette ($11) with squash, kale and cheddar. I was looking for more cheddar in there, but felt really good about my healthy, hearty and tasty meal, which came with fresh greens with a light dressing. I tasted the pancakes which rival some of the best places I have had pancakes at because they are slightly crispy on the outside, but soft in the middle. They were made with yogurt and had a nice serving of fruit (bananas, blueberries and blackberries) to go with it. Next time I might pass on the broiled grapefruit, because I think I love grapefruit how it is and don't think the broiling added much..or maybe would have liked a whole one for $3 (instead of half.) I had to glance at a dinner menu and just love the ideas there..creamy Kale? I may have been waiting for that my whole life... I hope to go back and give a 5 star rating when I see what else they have to offer. But I was totally satisfied and psyched about this place!",1
3524,9,5,1/4/2013,"What a great restaurant - pretty much ALL the things you look for in a good brooklyn spot. Killer and creative cocktails, the menu is just fantastic - the sweet potato gnocchi with bacon and onions is one of the best things I've ever eaten. Lots of places hit the mark on one aspect of the meal, but Hunters nailed the whole thing - drinks, dinner, dessert, ambience! (I'd also chime in that $$$ is misleading - I think $10 is de rigeur for a cocktail in cobble hill, and the entrees go from $15-25, which again, seems pretty reasonable especially for the neighborhood)",1
3525,9,5,12/29/2012,"i really love this place. So cozy, and down to earth, and the food is awesome. Â They're not doing anything too crazy, but what they are doing is well-executed, classic, and memorable. And the service has been consistently friendly and attentive. Â I wish there were more spots like this on Smith.",1
3526,9,4,12/11/2012,"I live in the neighborhood and was excited when I saw this place opening up. Most of the dishes on the menu sound really delicious. We went on a Sunday night for a casual drinking & eating experience and sat at the bar. I like the ambience, it's cool but relaxed, not pretentious but definitely hip. I agree with the reviewer who mentioned that the coupe glasses were served half-full, that's something that could use improvement. The cocktails in general were good but with a little work could maybe come up a level. The staff & bartender were accommodating and friendly. We ordered the toast of the day which had pear, parsnip and bleu cheese - tasted great but parsnip was a little undercooked and hard to bite through. It was a hearty piece of toast! Then we had the kale salad, pappardelle with boar ragu, and the burger. The kale salad was quite good and unusual, which I liked, and the portion was also really generous. The pappardelle was good, maybe could've used some salt? I definitely appreciated the homemade pasta though. And the burger - it was a love affair. I'm not sure why but it was incredible. Maybe it was the perfectly toasted brioche? The aioli? The juicy patty and melted cheese that somehow stayed put and didn't sogify the entire sandwich? I typically go for unfancy burgers (Shake Shack holla) and am disappointed with fancy ones, but this one was genuinely very, very good. On my top 10 burger list. Would definitely go back and look forward to seeing how the menu will change with the seasons.",1
3527,9,3,12/10/2012,"3.5 might be more accurate. We live up the street and were really excited to try it out. The space & ambience is cozy - that was our favorite part. Wait staff was on point. Have to agree with the other reviewer about the wine - we said the same thing. Really bad pours, especially for the price. It was also a limited wine selection on top of it. Appreciated they have local wines (Pindar), but anyone from LI knows Pindar should not have cost what it did. Ordered the basic salad & the soup special to start. Both were good, not amazing. Roasted chicken and gnocchi for main courses. They sounded delicious on the menu, and were good, but not blown away. Roasted chicken was overdone, sweet potato mash & brussel sprouts were something doable at home. The gnocchi was satisfying, but not a ""I have to go there have that again"" kind of dish. Barely tasted like sweet potato or goat cheese, 2 main ingredients. All in all it just felt like a bit too much money for OK food and too little wine. Sorry, for this type of food we'll stick with Rucola. Wish we liked it more.",1
3528,9,3,12/10/2012,"Saw this place on Eater's Heat Map so after going to a nearby restaurant and finding out that they were done taking walk-ins for the night (at 8PM!!) we walked to Hunter's. Place was full but got seated right away. Menu looked great. Ordered some food and some cocktails. Then the uneven experience started. Cocktails took a bit of time to come which I didn't really mind. Place had just opened up and service blips are gonna happen. But when the drinks came in their coupe glasses, they were pretty much half full. I would say that it was a 5oz coupe glass with 3oz of cocktail in it. Either pour a full glass or use a smaller cup. As for the food.... Chicken Liver Mouse: i love me some chicken liver mouse. I have to say this one was awful. It should be the consistency of room temperature peanut butter. Smooth. Yet this was hard. It was tough to get our knife through it. Flavor wasn't livery either. Big disappointment. The pickled veges that came with it were good though. Kale Salad: pretty awesome. I'd happily order it again. Sweet Potato Gnocchi: very good as well. Milk and Honey Braised Pork Shoulder: Sounded great on the menu. I had milk braised pork shoulder in Chicago at Purple Pig. It was awesome there. Here, not so much. Meat was tender but woefully underseasoned. Hunter's definitely has some promise. Space is nice and rather roomy for the neighborhood. People seemed to be having a good time. But with the other great options in the neighborhood, don't know if i'll be back.",1
3529,9,5,12/9/2012,"My Wife and I went last night. Â Had the meats (Charcuterie) platter. Â It was great... I forget where the mustard came from, but I think I remember that it did specify that on the menu... Whatever it was, it was insanely awesome.. I saved the rest of it for my burger. Â We also had the market greens salad because we both had a craving for goat cheese... The salad was nothing spectacular, but it was good, well dressed, and basic... really exactly what we were in the mood for. Â Now, onto the burgers. Â I'm a burger purist, so I have to judge this burger as a restaurant burger... It is not a burger joint burger.... The bun was too fancy, the cheese was cheddar, not American as, in my opinion, a burger should have on it... but the meat was perfect. Â So, all in all, we will definitely be back.",1
3530,9,5,12/3/2012,"Excellent food and Service! We like to try the new restaurants that open in our neighborhood (Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill, Carroll Garden) but are sometimes thwarted by lack of meatless options; my wife is a vegan. There were a number of viable dishes on the menu so that made our decision. We immediately liked the positive vibe and the bartender greeted us heartily. My wife had the squash agnolotti which she said was amazing and I had the Pork Shoulder which was tender and flavorful. It was one of the best pork dishes I've had. The mustard greens were cooked perfectly. We would have had more food but ate too much popcorn at the movies. All the staff were friendly and attentive. The decor is comfortable, simple and keeps the focus on the food. My only even slightly negative comment is the prices seemed high for Brooklyn. Hunter's may have become our new neighborhood favorite.",1
3531,10,1,2/20/2014,"Don't try this truck!!!! Â I dont usually do reviews but after reading such high reviews, and driving an hour drive in traffic, I felt I must review this food. Â The food was horrible. The chicken was too spicy with an after taste. They served regular white rice with a slight yellow tint instead of basmati yellow rice and the white sauce taste like mayonnaise. I love Halal chicken and I was greatly disappointed. I've had better food from the trucks near Jamaica ave.",-1

3535,10,2,7/21/2011,"After reading such rave reviews about this vendor's falafel, I was excited to try it for myself. I was very disappointed after the first bite. The falafel were soggy and overly salty. The onion slices were very thick and any bite with it had an overpowering onion-y flavor to it. The white sauce had no taste to it. Also, I'm not a fan of pickles and was surprised to find them in my wrap. The pita was the best part of the wrap to be honest- it was soft but not chewy. The fact that I did not eat the wrap right away or the very hot weather might have played a role in my sub par eating experience, but I also suspect that the falafels I was served were not fresh (I was told to wait a few minutes for falafels and saw one worker putting more in the oil and just a second later, my wrap was ready, before the freshly dropped ones were fetched from the oil). Seeing that this vendor has so many followers, I may give it another shot in the future, but not any time soon.",-1

I enjoyed sammys a lot more.",-1
3538,10,3,11/12/2013,"The food here is OUTSTANDING. I had chicken over rice that was perfectly cooked and ridiculously flavorful. Five stars by any normal account. While waiting on line they even gave us a free piece of falafel. You will never find a crispier falafel anywhere. The only con to it was that it was actually on the dry side. Why the minus stars? They're freakin' -filthy-! Dude. I don't give a damn about eating food off a street cart, or tamales made by some old Spanish lady's bare hands, or rice cakes cooked by some Chinese woman in a store front that's the size of my closet. That's normally great, authentic, culturally rich food. And I've eaten some very questionable food in my time. I was raised Filipino, where i learned to ""pick off the bad parts and eat the rest."" My stomach may not be totally made of iron, but I can handle food from a place the Dept. of Health would rate a C (you can get away with a lot and still get an A/B, I worked in the food bizz for a few years). The problem here is that none of these dudes changed their gloves once. I saw them stick their hands in raw falafel mix, handle cash money, and the -worst- offense, handle a filthy garbage container covered in wet rancid scrap-food mess to dump it into the nasty C-town dumpster a few yards away. AND NEVER CHANGED THEIR GLOVES. And then! stick their hands in a basket of cooked falafel to hand it as samples to people waiting on line! Wtf! I didn't finish my chicken platter the night I got it because: a) It was very filling and b) I was busy peeing out of my ass after eating it. BUT. Just to convey how delicious the food was, I STILL ate some of the left overs the next day because: a) It was delicious b) Someone stole my lunch at work and I didn't eat anything all day. Famished, I risked it a second time. Yes, stupid, my fault, and like damn clockwork I found myself pooping out everything I just consumed. On the plus side, this could be a really great diet. You get to eat amazing food and dump it all out before your body gets to absorb any calories. Seriously, if it wasn't for their complete lack of hygienic practices, this place would easily be five stars. Come here if you like the combination of tasty street food and playing the exhilarating game of seeing how long you can hold your diarrhea before crapping your pants. PS. Ask them to change their gloves.",-1
3539,10,3,10/27/2010,"And the winner of this years Vendy Awards is.......... Farez ""Freddy"" Zeideia's - the King of Falafel and Shawarma. eally do agree with the king of falafel part. Freddy fries up an unbeatable, oblong shaped falafel, which is absolutely delicious. Its crisp on the outside and the filling is perfectly spiced. The best part is that you get to try a free falafel while you wait for your order to be cooked up. Freddy's halal cart serves up quite a variety of shawarma, falafel and chicken rice combinations. I really liked the basmati rice that comes with their rice platters. It is very nicely flavored and the pickled turnips that they add to their salad really adds great bite. All the people working at the King of Falafel and Shawarma cart are super friendly and even though it is a food cart, it has a nice homey, community feel to it. So if you are in and around Astoria, do make sure that you go and pay homage to the king!",-1
3540,10,4,1/5/2015,So I usually won't eat any halal unless Â it's 53rd and 6th halal but after eating this i know why they are called the king of falafel the food was great as well as the customer service they even give free samples I can honestly say this was even better than 53rd thanks to my friend Bruno for bringing us the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because they ran out of BBQ sauce will definitely return most likely next weekend lol,-1

It was kind of hard and over spiced! I wouldn't buy the falfel here but will go back to try the rest of the menu! I went there on 9.29.2010, shortly after he won the vendy award which he has literally placed on a pedestal next to the cart lol!That was the topic of conversation amongst the folks waiting for food. I tried to talk to him and get him to pose for a pic but he was conversating with a couple and the line for food was growing so I Â ordered, I got my food and caught the bus home to Woodside.",-1
3549,10,4,7/8/2009,"if you love Falafel and Shawarma, this is the place, hands down!!",-1
3550,10,4,3/15/2009,"Where was he?? Are they not open on sundays? I went and only saw the lonely menu hanging on the fence, darn Edit: So I went back the next day (monday) and there he was! Ordered the falafel sandwich with tahnia sauce and hot sauce, was very tasty and the pita was soft and fresh! Not better than my dads falafel in NC, but still absolutely fantastic! Thanks ahmo!!",-1
3551,10,4,2/23/2009,The Halal cart on Broadway is one of the best deals in Astoria. Â Although their chicken rice plates can be a little inconsistent at times (warning - when it's slow) - it's usually the most amazing six dollar meal you can find. Their falafel is always amazing - and I love the little salad on the side - with the pickled turnips. Â Always always go for the white and red (hot) sauce - they go together like peas and carrots. Also for a change of pace - the combo plate (kefta and chicken) is a great deal and when you are in a carnivorous mood - their beef kebabs are mouth wateringly tender and an amazing addition to your plate for 2 bucks. As good as it gets for lunch (or a quick dinner) in Astoria - you can catch me there at least once if not twice a week!,-1
3552,10,5,12/25/2014,"Great taste, nice variety.",-1
3553,10,5,11/20/2014,This is my favorite food truck in New York!! The spicy rice and white sauce is delicious! I could eat that everyday for the rest of my life,-1
3554,10,5,11/3/2014,If the Halal Guys (53rd and 6th) had a brother this would be the place. This halal cart is by far one of the best New York has to offer. When I first was introduced to this place the guys here were kind of enough to give us samples of their falafels and it is delicious! I'm also a fan of getting a combo. Why not the best from both worlds. What I love this place besides their delicious and tasty food is they accept credit card! If you are ever in Astoria give this place a visit and try it. The cost is cheap and the taste is superb. Your stomach will happy. Enjoy your visit.,-1
3555,10,5,10/18/2014,"Just having finished a shawarma and chicken sandwich, I find myself drooling over this review. This vendy is nothing short of ""Supercalifragilisticespialidocious;"" every good memory in my life flashes in my mind as I take a bite. Paired up with free solid falafel, line or not, professional, courteous, and friendly service, and sheer convenience, the only thing I wonder is why they are only King, and not Ruler of the Free World. Having lived in multiple cities in the world, I can not think of a better business that I would buy stock in if they went public. To top it off, one of my first visits a few weeks back was with some friends from Florida who are soon to be married. As a wedding gift, they jokingly asked me for some of King's food, to which the owner not only loved and welcomed, but offered me assistance in making it happen for my good friends. If I could use two, unvulgar words (while vulgar, still a great and raving review), to describe King, I would have to say ""stand up"", as in the kind of man I try to be, someone you can always depend on.",-1
3556,10,5,9/17/2014,"Believe the hype. This cart is amazing. I once got there and the line was all the way to the c town. I wondered whether or not it was worth the wait. People got in line behind me so I decided it was and was not disappointed. They give you a piece of falafel while you wait and their energy and good cheer is contagious. The food is to die for..any of it, all of it. I keep going back to try more and i cant get enough!",-1
3557,10,5,6/21/2014,One word.. DELICIOUS! Sure it may cost more than your local halal cart but it's worth the money! The portion of the food is great and it'll fill you up for days! Their falafels are the best I've had so far. They give samples out and I suggest everyone to at least try it. I always order the chicken over rice mmm my favorite,-1
3558,10,5,6/12/2014,pretty good.,-1
3559,10,5,5/6/2014,"This is by far the best halal cart in the entire city, much better than the more famous cart on 53rd and 6th, this cart has more authentic style food, and more variety. The falafels are probably the best thing here, they also have a genuine Tahini based sauce for falafel unlike other carts.",-1
3560,10,5,3/16/2014,"So freaking delicious I have to stop myself from coming here every night. All the chicken dishes are phenomenal and even if you skip the rice and just do chicken and salad (to save a few calories?), it's addictive. The falafel is perfectly crispy and light. Â Yum!",-1
3561,10,5,2/17/2014,"These guys are the best in the business. I was so excited when they opened a cart on 30th Ave, as now they are the ONLY halal cart I go to. They are just as good as their cart on Broadway, the only unfortunate difference is they don't offer the beef kebab at the 30th Ave cart, only at their Broadway location. Every time I go, they are always very friendly and generous with their servings, and they'll always give you a sample falafel while you wait in line, which will settle any doubt about the quality of their cooking. The second you take that first bite of falafel, you'll skip home like a giddy school girl until you get to eat the rest of your food. I've tried just about everything they have on their menu, and I have never been disappointed. Great chicken, great shawarma... the true Kings of Falafel. All I ask, start serving your beef kebab!!",-1
3562,10,5,1/28/2014,"They really make amazing shawarma... I always wanted to try shawarma, because it greatly reminds me of the Turkish kebab, and the Greek gyros pitta. I traveled to this place, so eager to taste the shawarma. The meat was really amazing, and they make their food with care, you can tell by the taste and the very look of the food. It smells and tastes godly. Everything is so fresh, and you can simply feel the authentic taste. I really liked it. If you have any doubts about this place, please just go there and try it for yourself, experience divinity !",-1
3563,10,5,12/27/2013,Amazing! I could eat this every day,-1
3564,10,5,12/23/2013,Hands down the best Falafel I ever had. The owner Freddy is a very pleasant guy & friendly.,-1
3565,10,5,7/3/2013,This is awesomely awesome. The schawarma is amazing and so is the falafel. The greatest thing about this place is the ambience. Its awesome. Its al fresco. And I got a new hat!!,-1
3566,10,5,6/29/2013,These guys make the best humus I know. Im a vegetarian and glad that they served a great tasting falafel. Many falafel restaurants use very bland spices but these guys know what they are doing. Â I will be back shortly to try other items on the menu such as the eggplant dish (cant remember the name). Also service was amazing.,-1
3567,10,5,4/22/2013,"Bottom line, if you want good falafel, or good shawarma, just come here. I have been here a couple times, and it's so delicious. 5 stars all the way on this place.",-1
3568,10,5,9/21/2012,Believe the hype--these guys rule. I honestly believe this is the best value in the city. The food is outstanding (better than what you'd find at most comparable sit-down restaurants) and amazingly inexpensive. The guys are friendly in a no-nonsense way and will sometimes give you a free (and delicious!) falafel patty while you wait.,-1
3569,10,5,8/11/2012,"This is hands down the best falafel you can get in NYC- I don't care that it's in Astoria, make the trip and try it just once and you'll be hooked. It is hot, fresh, perfectly spiced and so delicious. Â The guys are friendly and give you free falafels as you wait. Â I know it's a long line, but get there early or go on a rainy day- there will still be a line, but a bit shorter. Â Trust me, it is worth it.",-1
3570,10,5,4/12/2012,The best food cart Â in NYC. Addicting. Freddy is awesome.,-1
3571,10,5,3/1/2012,"The best street meat cart in NYC, hands down. Â The meat and the vegetables are always fresh and they are generous with the portions. Â I've had every dish and pita sandwich from this cart and have never been disappointed. Â Sure, the falafel and chicken over rice is good, but my favorite is a kefta & shawarma platter over yellow rice, pita on the side, lots of white and hot sauce. Â Very good sized portion, especially for the price. Â The free falafel samples are always a good treat when waiting on line. Â Can't beat this place and great prices.",-1
3572,10,5,12/3/2011,This is one of the cheapest place for anyone to get a full meal. You can virtually order anything on the menu and you'll never regret it. The specialty here is chicken so if you want to get the full experience try the chicken platter.,-1
3573,10,5,9/28/2011,"This place is literally the best Halal style food you'll be able to find in the whole city. Not even generalizing it. I've tried many different places and this one still beats them out on the quantity and quality of food you get. Freddy is always a blast to talk to and keeps the atmosphere alive as he and his coworkers are making your food. Try his own creation ""Freddy's Jr."". Completely worth the $7 you're paying for it. I'm a fan of spicy food so nothing from this food turns me away. Don't let other reviews discourage you! If you notice, 95% are 4+ stars, so if a couple of people rate it a bit less, that's all on them and how picky they are. King of Falafel and Shawarma definitely deserved their Vendy, and its about time they got it.",-1
3574,10,5,8/13/2011,"ORDER THE LITTLE OMAR! This is the best dish Freddy, the King, makes, and it's not on the menu!! Shawarma, chicken, a mixture of sauces, chopped pita bread, tomatoes, onions, and sometimes even a crushed falafel. Â (If he's in a good mood, you might get some kefta, too.) Â It's everything but the kitchen sink, and the most important ingredient is Freddy love! Â Everything I get there is amazing- definitely worth the wait. Mucho love for my habibi, The King of Falafel and Shawarma!",-1
3575,10,5,8/12/2011,I am hooked! I am moving to Astoria just for this cart!,-1
3576,10,5,8/12/2011,Wow these guys are great! One of the best chicken wraps I have ever had. The line was long but moved very fast. Also the food was so good I found myself in the line again 2 days after.,-1
3577,10,5,8/12/2011,"I started a delivering job and I had a drop off right next to this amazing food cart. All I can say is I was very impressed with my food. I ordered the chicken on a grilled pita with veggies with white sauce and hot sauce. It was $4 by the way and I would gladly pay more for it. I encourage everyone reading this to give it a try. but beware, don't order the hot sauce if you don't like hot food. Very clean and great service.",-1
3578,10,5,2/15/2011,"I have tried many Halal carts in NYC from Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens with the highest rating. I have to say, this place tops all of them. The meat and rice just compliment each other and is not blend like many other places that need their sauce to create taste (like 53rd in Manhattan). I certainly recommend!!",-1
3579,10,5,1/5/2011,"Best halal cart I have ever been to and they have the ""Vendy Award"" to prove it. They are super nice and efficient when taking orders. I don't know if it's a bad thing that they always remember me. I think I eat here too much, but it's just so good. Schwarma, Falafel, Chicken w/ Yellow Rice. These are all things you must try from here. The hot sauce is very hot, so I recommend getting some of the vegetables on the pita or plate to cool down. The ""white"" sauce is also a must. Everything seems to be freshly made every day. The price is right. You should be paying more for the quality and how authentic the food is. That chicken is made with LOVE!",-1
3580,10,5,11/9/2010,yesssssssssss the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!,-1
3581,10,5,8/11/2010,"Best falafel I've every had! It's The King of Falafel and Shawarma is making his third trip to the Vendy Awards, will 2010 be The Year of the King? Watch great video on His Highness, blip.tv/file/3985908",-1
3582,10,5,5/20/2010,"I work in nearby rego park and I try to go here at least a few times a week. Â I get the kefta shawarma in a hero or the chicken plate. Â Strongly Recommended. Â For those dissuaded by the very busy Astoria / LIC location, there is parking in the street during peak lunch times.",-1
3583,10,5,5/7/2010,"This is THE Halal Cart in the five boros, forget about that 53rd and 6th BS. This the best chicken and rice cart on Earth. Not only do they make chicken and rice but they also make Kofta, Shawarma, Shish kebabs, and also lamb chops. I have had the chicken and rice, lamb chops, and sandwiches. The style is different from most Halal carts that take a spin on South Asian curried chicken, this one is Middle Eastern style. I used to live near this cart and bought food from it several times a week, never got tired of it. Its pricier than other carts, $6 for the basic chicken and rice dish and $10 for the lamb chops, pricey but you get excellent food. And the salad you get with your food is real salad not some lame lettuce leaves. There are a lot of fairly pricey sit down restaurants in the area but this cart beats them all on their superior food and friendly service.",-1
3584,10,5,4/27/2010,"This is my first yelp review ever as I had to create an account to rave about the King of Falafel and Shawarma cart on Broadway. Â They are located a few blocks from the school I work at on the way home and the delicious smell of that cart plagues me every day. I had their beef and chicken plate (Freddy Junior) and found it tasty but it does not compare to their Chicken and Rice. That plate is money. The mix of rice (either basmati or yellow) with Chicken, salad, tomatoes, pickled turnips along with their hot sauce and white sauce it the most amazing combination. Top that off with a delicious falafel and you just can't go wrong. I've had my share of falafel carts and this is by far the best. In addition, Freddy is amazingly friendly and has a great memory. I saw him greet a customer that hadn't stopped by in a year! That's how devoted he is to his customers. Not to mention, I work for a non-profit organization and he was so excited to do community service work. So if you're looking for a place to eat, go to the King of Falafel and Shawarma. Big portions, big taste, and big hearts.",-1
3585,10,5,10/29/2009,"The food is astoundingly beautiful and tasty. Â A perfect falafel greeted my taste-buds as they were soon treated to the most phenomenal plate of street food I have ever had the pleasure to partake of (indeed, this meal was superior in most ways Â to the majority of the sit-down meals I've had) And who knew pickled beets could bring that precise mix of spices and hot sause all together so well? I give as high a recommendation to this place as I possibly can. Long live the king!",-1
3586,10,5,9/1/2009,by far - the best cart in queens! love the chicken plate - have it over salad if you're cutting carbs.,-1
3587,10,5,8/23/2009,Great food for great value!,-1
3588,10,5,6/13/2009,"By far the best truck/cart food I've ever had. Â Better than 99% of the restaurants in which I've eaten, including ones where they check your Amex platinum card before they let you in. Â (Don't ask how I got into places like those!) Â And those guys are sweethearts. I've eaten every kind of plate, wrap and kebab they make, and I still can't make up my mind which is best. Â Like most people, I've eaten the chicken and rice plate most often. Â But I like to eat the schwarma--the best I've had--or ""Freddy's Junior Plate,"" with chicken and kefta on rice. Â  You can get yellow rice, but I recommend the basmati: Â It's very aromatic and flavorful. One caveat: Â They will lard your dish with white and/or hot sauces unless you tell them otherwise. Â I like a little bit of white and a good dose of the hot sauce. Â And, yes, I take my plates and wraps with salad, mainly because I love those pickled beets. And ya gotta love those guys and their sign. Â If any of them were single, I'd Â take him home with me! Â I mean, come on, nice guys with a sense of humor who can cook (and are kinda cute, at least to me): Where ya gonna find that?",-1
3589,10,5,5/21/2009,"I just moved to New York 4 months ago and one of the first things I was introduced to was Halah food. I went to the famous one in Manhattan and was pretty impressed. Since then I have tried a couple of other halah carts in the city which were ok but not great. Yesterday I had the KIng of Falafel chicken and rice plate and it was AMAZING. By far the best I have had in Queens or Manhattan. The chicken was flavorful and not dry at all. (my biggest complaint of chicken) Â The sauce was very good and the salad and rice were good as well. The guys at the cart were really friendly and they gave me a piece of Falafel while I waited in line which was really nice and unexpected. The only downside I saw was that there was a line and apparently there always is, but oh well I can see why. I cant wait to go back and try some other stuff on the menu.",-1
3590,10,4,1/6/2015,"This pace has one of the best Mediterranean food i had in NYC. And the people who work there are so friendly that it is just my first choice when i am in the area. I know they offer Halal food, but for me it is not the reason. It is all about the food. They are VERY generous with the plates they make, and it is rare for someone my size to finish all of it by myself. And finally, the price is ridiculously law for the amount and taste you get in return.",1
3591,10,3,1/5/2015,"Ok so I really don't want to be the one who ruins the party here, so I won't :) but I must stay true to my opinion on those reviews (otherwise what's the point...). I really have nothing bad to say about this food, but I also struggle to understand the crazy hype around it. To me it was just a pretty much ordinary mediterranean fast food type of meal. Maybe because those crazy good reviews here build up an unrealistic expectations or maybe because I've lived almost two decades in the Middle East but that falafel and shawarma just didn't do that to me. I've had the Teaser platter btw.",1
3592,10,5,1/5/2015,I love their gyro. They are really nice people give out Flafel while you wait in line. But they close out like 9 or run out of meat by 7 pm. But taste and experience.,1
3593,10,5,1/5/2015,"The food is fantastic, the prices are more than reasonable, and the employees are always fun and friendly. It doesn't get any better for a food truck (it is a truck now, no longer just a cart).",1
3594,10,5,1/4/2015,"Best falafel you'll ever have!! This is a ""must eat"" in Astoria. Friendliest staff too. Despite working outdoors through all different seasons, they're always smiling and will make you laugh. Well worth the wait on their normal long line.",1
3595,10,4,1/3/2015,"This food truck (yes, it's a food truck), is run by the friendliest group of gents. I have only eaten the falafel, which is the best I've ever eaten. A side order is abudnant and modestly priced. I like to mix the hot sauce and tahini. Accepts credit cards.",1
3596,10,4,1/2/2015,"These guys are pretty much the best. I've tasted other falafel and shawarma platters, but none have come close. There is usually a line when I go no matter what time or day of the week. Now that they deliver I am definitely taking advantage of that.",1
3597,10,5,1/2/2015,best falafel ever hands down. they give you a piece if youre waiting in line. Very nice guys and they take CC now!,1
3598,10,5,1/1/2015,"This place is a neighborhood staple serving up some of the best food out of a cart (now brand new good truck). The line is sometimes long but they hand out free falafel while you wait. Fun to watch all the guys cooking and chatting with regulars. It's fast, convenient and always hits the spot. Everything on menu is great but I love their chicken and rice combo with extra got sauce. It's hard to beat the price and quality anywhere else. So happy they are there!",1
3599,10,5,1/1/2015,"NYC's best food cart two years in a row for a reason! I've traveled to Palestine and the Middle East several times and enjoyed the Chicken Shawarma more than any time I've had it overseas. It was juicy with a great sauce served on fluffy flat bread. Great food, good price!",1
3600,10,5,12/30/2014,The best falafel you will ever have in your lifetime. Have you not tried this place? Get off your seat and quickly take a train or grab a cab and get a falafel sandwich platter a la carte whatever now! I've tried many many falafels and this is by far the most perfectly seasoned and crunchy outside with amazing fresh inards ever! Chickpea magic is what this guy's got- don't believe me? They will give you free sample! I miss this place after my move but I will be sure to visit :(,1
3601,10,5,12/29/2014,"I've always been a fan of the unassuming underdog, and the King of Falafel Â & Shawarma fit the bill for just that. From its spot in front of a grocery store parking lot with fold-away tables and chairs for its customers to it's free samples of hot falafel, these guys really want their customers to enjoy the entire experience. I picked up a combo platter of chicken and falafel over rice and I don't think I'll ever be the same again. King of Falafel gave a new meaning to halal for me, and I can't wait to go back for another delicious dish. Note for the only slightly hungry: share a platter if more than one of you are ordering; you'll be full with just a half a platter each!",1
3602,10,5,12/29/2014,Had the Omar platter and it was divine. The chicken had the right amount of spiciness and flavor. The salad was a good addition and a needed balance for the meal. The two falafels that come with the platter were delicious and I think I will be getting the falafel platter next time. Make sure you grab a drink. The food can be hot!,1
3603,10,4,12/28/2014,"We drive by here all the time and always see a long line. Today I finally got a chance to see what the fuss is about! We just ate brunch so I only ordered 2 chicken and 2 beef kabob, 4 kabobs costed $13 total. Â Took it home and I was pleasantly impressed by the flavor, the flavor is really in the meat, not just on the surface like many other places. Also even though it's grilled and dry on the outside, the meat is still very tender inside. I will definitely come back and try the rice platter next time.",1
3604,10,5,12/27/2014,Soooooo good! The falafel is really good. I ordered chicken and falafel combination. I would say the chicken is better than the halal guys. They really packed the food into the container. Â I will definitely come back. :) wait....did I say their falafel is super good?,1
3605,10,5,12/27/2014,Amazing! So happy for them! Their new truck just adds to the quality of the food they serve. I crave the falafel! It's still a great deal for the plate of food that you can easily share or have delicious leftovers. A true neighborhood gem.,1
3606,10,4,12/25/2014,"This review deals with the King's current setup in his pimped-out royal food truck, which in my opinion is not as efficient as the previous humble food cart. Â  Broadway in Astoria is full of fine restaurants, representing all of the different ethnic groups that makes Queens the most diverse neighborhood in the world. In the immediate area of the King's royal truck, there's Colombian, Italian, Japanese, Thai, Chinese, Mexican, Brazilian cuisine all within a two block radius. Heck, throw in a good, old Southern Smokehouse for good measure. But the one establishment that consistently draws the crowds is the King of Falafel and Shawarma's food cart, an Astoria staple, that's been occupying the same spot in front of C-Town for as long as most of the newer residents can remember. Regardless of the temperature, or outside weather conditions, the line for the King's food often stretches down the block, breaking formation only when the occasional car wants to enter or leave the C-Town parking lot. The aroma of the food permeates block and whets your appetite for one of the hearty platters or sandwiches on the King's menu. To ease the pain of the wait, one of the staff will come by to distribute the King's signature falafels. The falafels are tasty, crunchy morsels of chickpeas and spices. The only way I can describe them are crunchy taste bombs. To date, I have not eaten a better falafel, and I am an avid fan of street meat. The King sets the bar for the falafels sold in New York City. Â  Once it's finally your turn, you get to order your food. Assuming you come early enough, you can order the Shawarma, which is delicious, but I guess there's a limited supply. Sometimes when I go at night, it's gone. The one consistent thing that's always available, and I guess is the plate that I am most fit to review is the chicken platter. When it's your turn to order, you state your meat preference and whether you want one of two kinds of rice, yellow or Basmati. I'm not sure which one is more authentic, but I figure I can get yellow rice everywhere, so Basmati it is for me. The King offers a good salad, which lettuce, tomatoes, onions and pickles native to his homeland. The chicken is marinated with spices and is always tender. You get a very generous portion of food. To top it off, you get a falafel on the side. The food is best enjoyed fresh as the falafel experience may be less than optimal when it's trapped with the other food in the container. . There is a small seating area within the C-Town parking lot, but more often than not, I find myself running home, so that I can enjoy the King's food. If it is not apparent already, I am a HUGE fan of this cart. So why only four stars? To be sure, I would rate it 4.5, but since i can't seem to do half stars, 4 is how it stands. Â I feel that with the King's enormous success, the experience for the regular customers has suffered a bit. The humble cart ""back in the day"" (up to about September of 2014), was an efficient assembly line, with the progress of the food prep following an logical order of rice, food, salad, sauce, and payment. Once one man is finished with his part, he passes it down to the next. Â While this is likely the same sequence inside the food truck, there's a lot of back and forth inside of the truck. The King, I believe, has started accepting orders for delivery, which furthers delays the wait of those who are actually there on line. Since the truck has arrived, I've been waiting at least twice as long for the food. Yet, I still stand there, despite the cold and/or weather conditions. This is a testament to how good the King is.",1
3607,10,4,12/21/2014,I wondered why people would stand in a line for food in 36 degrees temperature.I read a few reviews and decided to join the line myself; buckled down with hands in pockets. While waiting we (the line) was served with fresh falafel as a taste of what is to come. Â Having it for the second time ( first time from here) made me a falafel fan!!! Â The guy taking the orders was jovial and the cashier made conversing easy. My total experience answered my question. I will stand in this line again even in temps below 36.,1
3608,10,5,12/19/2014,"When I lived in this area, I would go here often. As far as cart food goes, it's at the top for New York.",1
3609,10,5,12/17/2014,"Best halal food I have ever had. I am a bit of a street meat connoisseur, I have have eaten chicken and rice all over the city and this chain has all the right stuff.

Simply stated, absolutely amazing! Definitely the best falafel I've ever had and as a special treat, I've gotten a free falafel while I wait. Nothing better to get my mouth watering for the real deal. Incredibly friendly guys and worth the small wait. So glad to see they are doing well- the new truck looks awesome. Definitely stop by, you will not be sorry!",1
3611,10,5,12/13/2014,"LOVE, love love love them! The most charismatic, professional, and talented food biz people I've ever seen. The food is DELICIOUS and no wonder there's always a long line, no matter how extreme the weather is.",1
3612,10,5,12/8/2014,Props for being out there in freezing weather. This place is like an institution. Been 3 years since I last came. Now I have a kid. Feels a little soup Nazi-ish but didn't have any probs. the $10 big daddy was Delish. They didn't skimp on the meat. I have been cutting down on rice as I've been getting overly sleepy on it. Whatever you do do NOT park at C town. There are signs and it's not fair to the people shopping there. Anyways got that over yellow rice with red and white sauce. My little one loved it too (without the red of course)! The other people after me were lackadaisical about where to stand in line and order. The big dude taking orders was NOT cool w that. Â Also pay the guy at the end on the right near the passengers window. Was just as good as I remembered it. Plus it is right by the Xmas tree and wreath sellers so it was kinda nice. The wreaths are $15-20 BTW!,1
3613,10,5,11/26/2014,"Beloved by many for the quality, value, and friendly service, this 2010 Vendy Award Winner is so popular that there's always a line of hungry people, no matter the weather. The menu is large and varied. The classic falafel, chicken, and shawarma are well-represented, of course, and are offered over rice or in a pita, and there are many combination platters available as well. The falafels here are unlike any other falafel in NYC. Instead of the typical rounded shape, these are oblong, resembling miniature torpedos. This is a crucial distinction, for this shape offers a perfect ratio of crispy exterior to soft interior. The falafels are never greasy, and are redolent of onion, garlic, parsley and cilantro. They're best eaten immediately to fully appreciate the texture. The chicken platter is one of the most popular options here, and with good reason. Boneless chicken thighs are seasoned with a blend of seven spices and marinated overnight. My particular favorite is the Omar Plate, which is a combination of that delicious chicken and shawarma, along with two falafels. This costs $9, and is plenty of food for two people.

3614,10,5,11/25/2014,"I've been in Astoria four years now, and I have loved and continue to love King of Falafel. The staff are always pleasant and eager to please. Chicken and rice with white sauce is my favorite. The falafel is amazing. They now take credit card and deliver. Super easy and convenient to find off the Broadway N/Q stop. These guys are out there cooking come rain, snow or shine and really are a nice addition to the local cuisine. Fast, tasty and VERY reasonably priced.",1
3615,10,5,11/25/2014,"I tried most of the things of their menu, and EVERYTHING is very yummy. Frankly, their falafel is the best I've ever had. The prices are very affordable and the guys are so nice and accommodating! They remember the likes and dislikes of their regulars and they are always happy to see you. Highly recommended!!",1
3616,10,4,11/24/2014,"LOVE THIS FOOD TRUCK!!!!!!! In a city where you can find decent falafel and shawarma on every other block, you have to come correct in order to keep a repeat clientele. I've eaten here over five times and each time it's delicious, meats are tender and sauces are delightful. I usually get The Ashley and it always delivers. Definitely try it out!",1
3617,10,4,11/20/2014,"Great food, sometimes the line can be 10+ ppl but they give out free falaffels for waiting. Love the new truck instead of the cart.",1
3618,10,5,11/18/2014,They are the best. I mean it. I tried most of the food car around the city but none of them better than a king ;) keep up the good work . You deserve it.,1
3619,10,5,11/17/2014,"Halal food! So much food for $7.00. Asked for the spicy chicken platter, couldn't be any better! It had yellow rice, pickled radishes, lettuce, onion, tomatoes, grilled chicken, hot sauce. Excellent bargain without lost in quality. I recommend this for anyone's appetite.",1
3620,10,5,11/13/2014,One of the best falafel sandwiches I've ever had. I had one today that was made w/ the bread they use for their shawarma sandwich because they ran out of pita bread. Amazing! I think I'm going to ask for the shawarma bread from now on!,1
3621,10,4,11/13/2014,"This cart is off the hook. If you wait long enough, you'll score a piece of falafel!! Don't get any ideas now... Ask for the fresher chicken, spicy rice, and a touch of hot sauce. A firebreather's dream!",1
3622,10,4,11/7/2014,"Killer kofta, excellent soft flavorful falafel. I liked the picked veggies too. There was a bit of a line, but was totally worth it. I made up my own combo dish and the guy was super cool about it.",1
3623,10,5,11/6/2014,"If you've ever wondered what real falafel should taste like, then you must try some from ""The King"". Just as the name suggests, these guys are the real deal. Crispy, moist, and flavorful falafel. Never dried out and always piping hot fresh. Did I mention they give you FREE samples while waiting online?! Winner of the ""NYC Vendy Award"", it's not just Astoria who's claiming these guys are the best. All of NYC agrees they are truly THE king of falafel and shwarma. With all the talk about falafel, yes, their shwarma is just as good! Succulent morsels of juicy lamb, chicken and beef, are placed over a bed of rice and mixed with pickled vegetables, lettuce, onions, and drizzled with yogurt and hot sauce. ( easy on the hot sauce though, no joke!) This location is the original, with a second smaller spot over on 30th ave. and 33rd street.",1
3624,10,5,11/4/2014,"My go-to spot for dinner. They just recently upgraded their truck (same menu; same price) which makes it way more efficient, shorter wait. Highly recommended with friendly staff, delicious food and great price. My favorite has to be the chicken platter!",1
3625,10,5,10/29/2014,"I love falafels and I thought I knew what a GOOD falafel tasted like. Nopes, not until I met King of Falafel & Shawarma! Now, they have upgraded to an eye-catching lime-green food truck from a small food cart! The falafel was so crispy, so crunchy, so flavorful, and so delicious! It easily became my favorite food on their menu! Get the falafel platter, it comes over salad and rice - they got two kinds: yellow and spicy rice. Don't you just love the options?! Chicken kebabs are really tasty here too! So tender and juicy on the inside. Beautifully charred and smokey on the outside. It's just that good! ...And don't forget the chicken or beef shawarma platters. Top them with their special Tahina sauce and Hot sauce; you will be dreaming of them for nights! The guys are extremely friendly! Very often, they will give out a falafel to customers! Take it. Don't be shy and don't you dare refuse it! There is usually a line, especially during the evening times but it's worth it! Believe me! You will be questioning if Halal Guys is truly your one true love!",1
3626,10,4,10/27/2014,"This is a good place to grab some food when you really don't have any time to cook. I find myself craving the felafel with the spicy sauce. It really is tasty but beware that spicy sauce is VERY SPICY. If you have a weak stomach, don't even try it! But definitely try it out. You'll get hooked.",1
3627,10,4,10/27/2014,"Chicken and Rice was amazing. The beef shwarma is decent. Not sure If i would get the pita again, but can't go wrong with the chicken and rice. The guy gave out free falafel balls to people waiting in line!",1
3628,10,5,10/26/2014,I loved the food. 1) The food is great. One of the best food carts. 2) I got the Omar plate. It was of large portion. However the price of 9 bucks is steep. 3) They accepts credit cards. Awesome!,1
3629,10,5,10/26/2014,"The absolute best cart for chicken over rice in my opinion! Fast, friendly service and price is always right.",1
3630,10,5,10/23/2014,I have traveled the Middle East and the shawarma at this truck may be the best I've ever had in my life.,1
3631,10,5,10/23/2014,"I absolutely loved it. The first night I got the chicken platter. Their main dish. And let me tell you....it was delicious. I loved it so much that me and my boys went back again today...right now. But this time I got the Hero Shwarma. It's always very delicious. But keep in mind this is a HERO not a Gyro (sometimes pronounced ""hero"") so it's more of a sandwich than a pita. But I love it. Oh and I had to stand in the rain for a few minutes to wait for my order but I didn't even mind. They were very fast and high quality",1
3632,10,5,10/20/2014,"Theres literally no way you cant stop here if you're on the block. They are so evil with the delicious smells they generate around the block, kind of hypnotizing you to their truck (or so i tell myself every time im on a ""diet"" and somehow find myself paying for another chicken over rice). They give you enough food to last your entire life, at the beautiful price of $6! The main dude there is so funny and entertaining; he actually challenged me to a dance off while there was a huge line behind us! Awesome experience, highly recommended :)!",1
3633,10,4,10/13/2014,"Well, the falafel is really, ridiculously good. I first noticed this when I got a free one while waiting in line (or on line, you crazy New Yorkers) last Thursday evening. I noticed it again when I received another free one with my chicken platter. They are so flavorful and not at all dry like some falafel. As for the chicken platter...well, it was pretty good, but I think these chicken platters may just not be for me. The white sauce is slightly tart and creamy, and the yellow rice on the bottom was very good. The whole thing is just a little too salty for me, however. I had the same issue with the chicken platter over at Halal Guys. $7 does buy you a TON of food. I only ate about a third of my plate and had to throw it out the next day because I was going out of town for the weekend. I will definitely be back to pick up a side order of falafel!",1
3634,10,5,10/7/2014,Great staff and awesome shawarma Looks like they went big time w the truck ditching the cart. Hope quality stays the same,1
3635,10,3,10/5/2014,"Falafel's? Yes probably the best I've ever had!! It's really good! However, their shawarma platter? Not that great! I'd definitely come back for the Falafel's though!",1
3636,10,5,10/1/2014,"Amazing! It was my first time a couple of days ago, but I probably had the best vegan Falafel in my entire life! The guys working there are so super friendly, which is very refreshing especially since we live in busy NYC where nobody has time to smile anymore. The wait in line is so worth it - not only are the vibes great, you'll get amazing food for an amazing price! I will definitely return for yet another one of those yummy Falafel sandwiches!",1
3637,10,5,9/28/2014,"The owner was soooo chill and funny! First time here and the wait time was decent. It didn't take more than 20 mins to order. They even passed out free veggie falafel for those who waited. When I got to order the owner of the truck was very friendly, very fast, packed that silver container to the max and even get a free falafel. I got the famous chicken platter for 7 bucks. But it was worth 7 bucks! My stomach afterwards was like carrying a three pound baby. I was full the rest of the evening and I ate that at around 6pm. They have very limited out door seating and extra condiments like white sauce and hot sauce for your liking. I will come back here again! Best halal truck by far!",1
3638,10,5,9/28/2014,"Great chicken platter, great people and great price. Their new truck looks so amazing!!!! It reflects the fun and creativity of the staff that we (all of Astoria) all love.",1
3639,10,3,9/28/2014,"Was not bad. But not Halal guys. Sorry, but not sorry.",1
3640,10,5,9/27/2014,"I love this place! Nice people. Fast. Amazing food! They also deliver. If you are in Astoria and want something on the go, then go here! Some of the best falafel and shawarma in the city!",1
3641,10,4,9/26/2014,"I love these guys and have been getting my falafel & chicken platter fix for the last 5 or 6years. However since they upgraded their truck(or start accepting credit cards), line is definitely longer and moves SO slow. It's nice that they give out a falafel while you wait, but sometimes you just don't have the patience.",1
3642,10,5,9/26/2014,knew that it was going to be great and it didn't disappoint. Everything is so good. Congrats on the new truck and keep on being the best in Astoria!,1
3643,10,5,9/24/2014,"So you are walking home from work tired and the last thing in the worllllddd you want to do is cook dinner. Good thing I have King of Falafel less than a block away from my house. It's located right outside of C-Town grocery store and is now a giant green food truck with the words ""yeahhh babbyyyy"" written on the front. Don't let that scare you. This place is absolutely fantastic and has quality food for the price. 7 bucks will get you a huge pile of delicious food they will most likely last you two meals. The guys usually give you a free falafel (so good) while you wait in line. Sometimes the line can get a bit long, but trust me, it's worth the wait. Great food great and friendly customer service.. What more could you want in a corner food truck? This place is my go to when I'm feeling lazy and am craving something delicious. Get the chicken bowl.. Mmmm",1
3644,10,5,9/22/2014,"Great food, right price, friendly staff! Â I'm visiting from out of town and wish there was a food truck this good where I am from. Tip: try the chicken plate with salad, yellow rice, and white sauce. Â Awesome flavor, big portion, only 7 bucks",1
3645,10,5,9/22/2014,This place hands down is the best halal cart in New York City. My favorite thing to order is the Freddy's junior. You can't go wrong with anything you get from this food cart. For 8 bucks you can get so much food you just can't go wrong with this place. The rice and kefta with chicken and vegetables is to die for. I live in flushing and I take this drive Atleast twice a week to astoria to get this food. The guys on the line are very cool also they give you a free falafel while you wait in line also.,1
3646,10,4,9/18/2014,"Friendly guys. Â Huge portion! Â It's a must share. Â Although it was good, will not trek across town again.",1
3647,10,1,9/16/2014,"The worst falafal sandwich ever. It is cold, and half empty. Falafal hard to find. I asked for hot and white sauce, and it is hard to find. Pita is cold and broken.",1
3648,10,5,9/16/2014,"They're the best in the city, hands down. This is based on my experience with their presentation, customer service, and quality. I've taken everyone that I possibly could and they've all enjoyed the food. This was one of the first stops that I wanted to make when I moved to Astoria. I couldn't wrap my brain around how a food truck had such a good rating online The staff has always been fun and while standing in line I've always been offered a free hot falafel every time that I've been. I usually get the lamb over rice and it always hits the spot. Add the perfect combination of their red sauce and white sauce, with a little bit of their secret extra spicy sauce. I pride myself on being able to handle the heat, and each time they crack a joke asking if ""I'm sure?"". During the late summer they upgraded and started taking credit card which was GREAT. No more trips into the dusty C-Town to hit the ATM. So if you aren't carrying cash no worries. They are also no located in a fancy new food truck, so if you were looking for a cart parked on Broadway they've been upgraded.",1
3649,10,2,9/13/2014,"Meh---- though they have a roped off line, it takes them FOREVER to get you on your way. Food is nothing special, and the free falafel I was given as a way to pass the 20 minute wait time while on the line was dry, and tasteless except for heat at the end. This was a preview to the sandwich---the meat was tough, dry, and not very well spiced. They are friendly, but for a great Shawarma cart meal, go to the Steinway Halal cart on 34th Avenue.",1
3650,10,5,9/12/2014,Love this Place! Can't wait to try out their cool new Food Truck! :) The staff and owners are always in a good mood and really nice! :) Wish there were more! :),1
3651,10,4,9/8/2014,"Finally got to try this cart's food. The hours of operation are earlier than normal carts so I was always too late. The food was good and portion was large, way more than the places that give the white trays. I was only able to finish half. They were out of shwarma so I can only comment on the chicken over rice. It was pretty good. It was more spiced (not spicy) than normal street cart platters to me, so it tasted more Indian. I would have it again if I was around the area because you know it's quality food for street food, but it isn't so good I would go out of my way for it, at least for my taste. The cart workers/owners were really nice too. They gave us samples of the falafel which was really good. Crispy outside, spiced tender inside. They gave me two while I was on line and then another in my platter. They put your order into an iPad lol which I haven't seen before for a cart. I would recommend this place if you're in the area and would probably go back myself to try the shwarma.",1
3652,10,5,9/6/2014,Best food truck ! Reasonably priced with tremendous portions! Be prepared to wait on line !! Worth the wait !,1
3653,10,4,9/5/2014,"This place is great! Â There is always a line and you do have to wait quite a bit, but the wait is always worth it. Â The chicken is white meat which I love and the food is always very flavorful. Â The guys that work here are always very nice and friendly despite the weather they have to stand outside and work in. Â As you wait in line they almost always give you some free falafel which is delicious. Â  As an extra bonus - they now accept credit cards!",1
3654,10,3,8/30/2014,"Food is great, chicken is seasoned well, smells amazing. Shwarma is a bit of a letdown compared to Mamouns Falafel.",1
3655,10,5,8/29/2014,Have always been the best and remain the best.,1
3656,10,5,8/22/2014,Hes not called the king for nothing their is just nothing compared to this food cart at all everyone else is truly inferior it's hard to explain why it's so good here you just got to experience it for yourself huge portions of savory tasty food for outstanding prices I think the most expensive thing is $9 and it's enough food for 2 meals,1
3657,10,5,8/20/2014,Best chicken and rice platter I've ever had. The free hot falafel while waiting in line is definitely a plus. The cart guys are super friendly too.,1
3658,10,3,8/18/2014,"No line when I went. Was not given any free falafel when I was ordering and waiting. Ordered chicken platter with yellow rice. Rice was just regular spanish yellow rice, no flavor. Chicken was way overly salted and only the top and outer shell of the chicken tasted good. Â The inside of the chicken meat was white as day. Only the falafel was somewhat good, but it was a bit over fried and a little burnt. Only good thing I had to say was there was no line and if you have no cash? no problem..they now accept credit cards. I would not come all the way here for some chicken a rice, there are better halal carts out there. Â Even if it was a drinking night, I would go out of my way to the original halal cart on 56th.",1
3659,10,3,8/15/2014,"I've tried this place a dozen times because I live nearby, but it still hasn't grown on me. Yes, it's a good deal. And yes, portions are generous. But money value isn't everything to good eating. Something about this business that doesn't work well with me, including allergies that cannot be pinpointed. And the food doesn't taste that great, everything taste vinegary and kills every other flavors. But mostly it's the owner's attitude. This is just one out of many similar encounters: I went here last week to try something different other than Italian sandwiches. I stayed on the line, readied myself with what I wanted. I asked for 1 wrap and 1 dish. The owner asks what kind of rice I wanted, and there were 2 types. I asked ""umm, what's the other rice called again?"" The owner replies ""Hey, if you don't now what you're getting, I can't serve it to you."" and starts looking at the other customer. I had to just order the one I wanted. Every time I go here the cart guys are in a rush, and the owner starts barking at you if they think you're stalling. I don't know if anybody else had this experience. The owner is pumping with adrenaline, and yells at you if you act timid. Now, this was a sunny day and the cart guys are working in front of a hot grill. Yeah, I get it. It's a tough work, and you have a long line and you want to serve quickly. But dude, chill out. After all, I'm the one buying your service with money. I don't want to feel threatened each time I am handing you cash. It's extremely uncomfortable. I'm sure other people won't have much problems with this place. But personally I feel the atmosphere is uninviting and uncomfortable. The owner dances, gives free falafel balls and puts on a show and it's great for the crowd. But personal experiences are more important to me and I'll take my business elsewhere. Also, I get allergic reactions everytime I eat at this place. The ingredients listed don't show what I'm allergic to, but it's unfortunate. *PROTIP*: Go here with your game face on, and yell out your orders and questions as quickly as possible.",1
3660,10,5,8/7/2014,"If I could eat the chicken platter from King of Falafel & Shawarma everyday, I would. Â Except I would probably gain 200 pounds and die a very early death. Â In lieu of that, I greatly enjoy a trip to the cart every once in a blue for their amazing chicken platter, complete with a falafel that was so tasty, I was tempted to steal my friend's from her plate. Â (So serious.) Â You know the halal they're slinging has to be top notch because even the Halal Guys (53rd & 6th) hang out there. Â That or maybe they're connected somehow, I wouldn't be surprised. Â FYI, there will always be a line, but it moves fairly quick. Â On a Saturday afternoon they had four guys working the station. Â Four guys cooking on a single cart!",1
3661,10,5,8/6/2014,I love their FALAFEL! Bunch of friendly guys cooking tasty food! I've tried few of their dishes but I must say the Falafel is the winner in my book! There is always a line and it seems they have loyal customers that's a stamp of approval for me! I would definitely go back!,1
3662,10,2,8/2/2014,"In comparison to the halal guys in midtown, these guys are definitely not 4.5 stars. 1) plate is smaller than other halal places. 2) the rice is not as good. I had the yellow rice. Maybe basmati is a better choice. 3) they charge you $7 for chicken platter when every where else is $5 to $6 sometimes including a free soda. Taste of chicken was 3.5 stars (excluding rice). Overall 2 star for the experience. Guys were really nice so 5 stars for that. I hope they don't let the 4.5 star yelp review influence their quality, price and portion.",1
3663,10,5,7/31/2014,"this place...I'm going to say it...this is probably my favorite meal in Astoria. ::drops mic:: no but really though, believe the hype and get on over there. there's also one in front of rite aid (30th ave and 33rd st.) just be prepared to have the food baby of your life.",1
3664,10,5,7/28/2014,So good and filling! Prices are awesome. Line is worth the wait,1
3665,10,4,7/28/2014,"The shawarma is my favorite, falafel also good, the chicken kabob is basically like a chicken sharwarma. Always love the baklava. And the on-going middle eastern music is fun background filler. Great way to introduce the food to kids/adults. There is more variety than I have described here.",1
3666,10,1,7/27/2014,"Guys - I love this place, it's typically my go to while in Astoria. However, today I found a cockroach in my chicken plate combo. I was just about to take a bite and there it was buried in the chicken. Yes if was dead but it was big enough to completely gross me out to the point of vomiting. I have pics to prove it check if out just posted them.",1
3667,10,5,7/24/2014,"This place is awesome. I have no idea what a Shawarma is, other than spicy beef and lamb, but I will definitely make my way back here to get one. Oddly enough, I spotted this place on my way to another restaurant in Queens. That restaurant was quiet and empty and King of Falafel had a line down the block. That sparked my curiosity enough to come back. After circling the block a number of times, I found a spot a couple of blocks down. So I head to the line and we're in business. First, they give you free falafel as you stand in line. That's customer service! The falafel was excellent. Crisp on the outside and tasty inside. (I can't say it would ever occur to me to fry chickpeas, but I am glad they did.) I say that because I've had so many crappy falafels I almost wrote off the genre. So I order the beef falafel, the guys -- there are like 4 of them, cooking, working, etc. -- help me through the order. There's no where to sit. You are taking this to go. And given how busy the street is, you are not eating it there. No worries, I get back to the car, just to try a bite. Wow. The beef/lamb is spicy, but not hot. There are hints of cinnamon! Just a great combination of spices. And that white sauce -- I hate to call it by that name, but that's what they call it -- is awesome. And all of this for $5. Â Let's stop playing around. This is the best value I've had in a long time. Now, you have to be prepared to eat somewhere else. That can be an issue if you are coming by the N or the Q -- which serve essentially Astoria in that section of Queens. But the location is convenient to almost all parts of the City, and I so I'd recommend a trip, even if this is a way onto another destination. Â Bring some for the friends, they'll appreciate it.",1
3668,10,5,7/20/2014,I stand there for the free falafel balls that are given out while you wait for food... By the time your time is up to order you'll be full and good to go! Yay for good free falafel balls:),1
3669,10,5,7/14/2014,"If you follow the ""There's a long line it must be good"" mantra, then you're right... King of Falafel & Shawarma is the best! There's a line all the time (but the wait it roughly 5 minutes)... and if you're lucky, you'll get a free falafel just for waiting around. Chicken and rice is $7. It's enough for 1 1/2 meals for an average guy like me. The chicken is delicious and get the pickled veggies!",1
3670,10,4,7/14/2014,"Probably the only place I can say I love to wait in line--because they give free falafels! Their chicken is by far the best compared to any cart--including The Halal Guys. Their falafel is crispy and tasty. I've had their lamb, and it's thick--unlike The Halal Guys' lamb. Therefore it tastes more ""real"" and less ""meat-loafy."" The only thing I don't like is that the Astoria location is closed on Sundays!",1
3671,10,4,7/13/2014,"Tasty food; generous portion; great customer service (the attractive cook gave us all a falafel while waiting on line)...I understand why they have received positive reviews...they are deserving! Although, my taste brings me to another 'halal type' food cart...Rafiqi's and Shahs seem to be what my taste buds prefer. What King Falafel has, that the others don't: much larger portions, great customer service (I don't know any food cart that allows individuals to order in advance.), and no tacky tip jar! It's worth the trip, you won't be disappointed!!!! (Btw: I ordered the Ashley over rice with white sauce and light hot sauce.)",1
3672,10,5,7/12/2014,"This is hands down the real King of Street meat. The Halal Guys don't come close to Freddie and his Chicken and Rice. Â  Their kabobs are also delicious, but their chicken and rice is the star. Plus it is a ton of food for the price. Probably the best bang for the buck in NYC next to .99 cent pizza and hot dogs. But much tastier. Plus the guys running the show are awesome and give you a falafel while you wait in line.",1
3673,10,4,7/9/2014,"This is the best street food you can get in town! The food is super flavorful and the falafel is really good. If you need to get your ""halal"" fix this is the spot. The guys are really friendly too",1
3674,10,5,7/7/2014,"This place is pretty awesome. The cooks are always friendly and often hand me free food when the line is a bit long. I come here for the chicken wrap in pita. Best falafel stand in Astoria, I'd say.",1
2640,10,5,7/7/2014,"They have a very good food, often you have to stay in line to get something from them. Excellent chicken sub! But be careful, if you choose hot, it will be hot!!! Very good anyway!",1
3675,10,5,7/6/2014,This is one of the best halal meals in NY...... Â Chicken and rice is very good!! Â I say they are better than the halal guys on 53rd & 6th.....,1
3676,10,5,7/1/2014,I love their food! I'm completely hooked. Everything is so fresh and delicious. If you want great food at a great price in queens this is the place.,1
3677,10,4,6/28/2014,"A lot of people rave about that halal cart on 53rd in Manhattan, but that cart does not compare to these guys. Very kind workers who offer a falafel when standing on line, but more importantly they truly over up to their name as Kings of Falafel and Shawarma.",1
3678,10,5,6/25/2014,I loved their food! I am a streetmeat fan and this is actually absolutely one of the best street meat I have ever had! I had the basic chicken over rice and yes it is good. The spice in the chicken is so balanced with the chicken that I thought something was wrong. I have to say that the owner has a great personality too! He's so JOLLY LOL! Loved his attitude towards people and usually that makes up for half the experience! The Â tiziki sauce was good and the hot sauce was pretty spicy. He let me try one of his CRAZY hot sauce and I was on fire! What a fun guy and cart to be around! I strongly recommend the chicken platter and say hi to the owner! Tell him tea and milk says hi LOL! He knows what that means!,1
3679,10,5,6/25/2014,"I order the falafel anything. It is very delicious, made fresh and served quickly. This is a food cart and one of the best in my opinion. There always seems to be four friendly guys serving up great food and a complimentary falafel while you wait in line. I get a complete meal - sandwich with all the fixins' - for $5. Sometimes I'll get two side orders of falafel -that's eight good sized pieces- for $4 and complete my meal at home!",1
3680,10,5,6/22/2014,falafel and chicken platter are both really good. owner is amusing,1
3681,10,5,6/18/2014,"Probably the best ""Chicken and Rice"" in the tri state area. These guys have been at it for well over 20 years and you can taste the experience with every bite. Always really fresh and really tasty. Don't waste your time with 53rd and 6th, that is nothing compared to these guys.",1
3682,10,4,6/15/2014,This cart is awesome. I'm not a huge fan of halal carts but this is pretty much the only one I will eat from. The food is awesome. They cook everything right there in front of you and cut the lamb right off the rotator so you know the food is very fresh. They also sell a huge amount of food so nothing is left sitting. The owner is a real funny guy to. Always have a good laugh when I stop here. If you like halal this is best cart in the city,1
3683,10,4,6/11/2014,"I came at 8:45pm on a Tuesday, and they were sadly out of shawarma, so I had a chicken hero. Â It was good but it seemed like it relied a little heavily on the added sauces for flavor. Â From past experiences with shawarma cuisine, I think you want the meat itself to provide the flavor. The guys were nice and gave me a free falafal before the hero was ready.",1
3684,10,1,6/8/2014,I just don't understand why this place is so popular on yelp. Their food is simply aweful except the falafel. I got sick every time I tried their food.,1
3685,10,5,6/6/2014,Long live the king! Still the best cart food around. Â Just tried the chicken shawarma and that is excellent like everything else. The falafel are still the best though. Â Unbelievably good and Freddy knows it giving away free samples to all on line.,1
3686,10,4,6/5/2014,"What can I say I am addicted to Food Carts, and this is a reason why... I sneak quick parking inside the Ctown Parking lot (Park at your own risk) I ordered the combination of Kefta & Chicken over rice and salad I went light on the Tahina sauce & hot sauce, it also came with a falafel for $8.00 how can you go wrong? This cart is extremely busy, so you know you will always be getting freshly cooked & hot food. No food laying around for hours waiting to get heated up over and over, that is a plus. I got in my car rolled down the window turned on the AC, time to chow down. I don't enjoy eating soggy food, no time to waste! The seasoning was different from other carts I have tried in a good way, it gave the food more of a traditional taste. The Kefta & Chicken were cooked perfectly, the rice was not over powering and balanced well, the Falafel crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. The Hot Sauce was just the right amount of heat. I found myself so stuffed, but yet couldn't stop myself from finishing my plate. "" FYI: when there is a line they usual give out a free falafel sample :) """,1
3687,10,5,6/5/2014,"I am generally a big fan of the halal chicken cart. Â And this is the best one in the city. Â With honorable mentions to Rafikis, Tariqs, and that one in midtown everyone talks about that I've only been to once because I'm not a yuppy, KFS is number one. Â If you didn't give this place at least 4 stars, you should be banned from the Internet.",1
3688,10,3,5/25/2014,"Let's get right down to it. Â This is a food cart, so everything you'd normally ""review"" about a restaurant doesn't apply. Â Other than the 5 plastic chairs they have in the adjacent parking lot for ""diners"" to sit on, this is all about the food. You have basic choices of falafel and shawarma in various styles (pita, plate, etc). Â The food was good. Â It didn't knock my socks off like say Hummus World in Roslyn or Tanoreen in Brooklyn, but those are the gold standards. The falafel was crispy on the outside and soft and hot on the inside. Â Really nice. We had both chicken and shawarma in both platter and pita form. Â Both were good but I'd give the nod here to the chicken platter. Â The sauces (yogurt, tahini and hot sauces) were all homemade, really fresh and excellent additions to our order. Overall I'd recommend this if your in the neighborhood but it's not a destination kind of place.",1
3689,10,5,5/23/2014,"Truly legendary, the meal melted in my mouth. Try everything because they are all good.",1
3690,10,5,5/21/2014,"My mouth is watering as I begin to write this review. Got this for dinner after work yesterday and there was a huge line. Nothing crazy, but at least 12 people deep. It was worth the wait! Unfortunately, they were out of schwarma. So I got the chicken and kefta. Â Love the white sauce! They didn't give me enough hot sauce, but now I know to ask for more on the side or something. I also had to get a side of the falafel. So last night, I basically had 5 falafels and less than half of my platter. So good and I can't wait to get home and eat more. Â Everything is very flavorful. Â I love the pickled vegetables it comes with. It really gives the dish a variety and you are getting a vegetable serving :) The rice was a little overcooked for me, but the flavor was great. Â The guys that worked the cart were friendly, helpful and made everything a smooth process. Â Don't be afraid to ask any questions and they will give you a recommendation if something is out. Better than the Halal Guys chiekn & rice. Sorry.. found my new favorite!",1
3691,10,5,5/15/2014,"Best street meat in NY, hands down - and trust me, I know my street meat. I have yet to try the lamp or beef, because every time I come here the chicken looks and smells so divine (maybe next time!) The cheerful cooks and free falafel makes standing in line go by fast. P.S. Go easy on the hot sauce - it's seriously hot.",1
3692,10,5,5/10/2014,Best food and best guys Amjad & dawood ar so nice I eat every day they have best test of food ever I love coming back and I Bering all my friends to test food from these people they ar the best,1
3693,10,5,4/28/2014,"The reason people line up at this truck even in the snow and rain is because it's THE best choice for chicken, shawarma, and falafel. And it's inexpensive too! A plate with meat, rice, salad, and a falafel will only run you about eight bucks! The guys who run the cart are a good time as well. Their Vendy award is well deserved!",1
3694,10,5,4/17/2014,"dude. mumtaaz jiddan! i rocked a falafel pita for the first time from these guys tonight. INCREDIBLE balance. the flavors played well together...perfectly, actually. Plus he gave me a free piece of falafel while I waited. shukran habibii! will be eating here ALL THE TIME NOW.",1
3695,10,3,4/16/2014,"So I had some trouble finding this place because for some reason if you try to gps the address it takes you some place else! But I found them eventually on Broadway, I ordered the falafal and the chicken platters. It was line, but during the wait they have out kibbeh to try, nice. I couldn't eat my meal yesterday when I bought it so I'm having it for lunch today. I'm sure it would have tasted better fresh, but a day later its just ok.",1
3696,10,5,4/11/2014,"Coming from Dearborn and us having the best Arabic food places EVER, I must admit this place is something that Dearborn needs! I wish we had push carts there. It's really not necessary for us to have but even a sit down restaurant from this place would be so ideal! First time I had it was like 4 days after being in NYC, now I crave it every day! But realistically that's only if I wanted to gain 100 lbs in a week! Lol! My fiancÃ© and I shared the chicken platter which was more than enough for 2 people. Their falafel..... Probably the best I've everrrrr had! Plus super nice ppl working!",1
3697,10,3,4/4/2014,"I finally tried this place after reading tons of online reviews and I'm on the fence. Â I got the chicken platter with salad. Â The chicken is good, but not very different from similar carts. Â The yellow rice was a little undercooked, but that's not a deal breaker. Â What I didn't like was their white sauce. Â It's a little to thick, sweet and tangy for me. Â It tasted like ranch dressing to me. Â I prefer white to be thinner to moisten and mix well with the rice and bits of chicken and this one was just a little too goopy for my taste. Â  What I did like was the pickled veggies that came with the salad. Â It's adds a different touch to the standard lettuce, tomato and onions. Â And while I wasn't wowed by the chicken and rice, I got to sample a kefta and that was really tasty. Â It was clearly freshly made, hot, crispy on the outside, but soft, moist and flavorful on the inside. Â In the future, I would get just the kefta and some salad. Â No white sauce.",1
3698,10,5,4/4/2014,Probably the best chicken / kabab and rice in NYC.,1
3699,10,5,3/26/2014,"Omar bro you and your plate rock! Ashley baby, did I forget to tell you that I love you? This is the best street food I have tasted in New York. Everything is right about their falafels and kefta. Chicken and shawarma are alright but I prefer the former two a lot more. I would take the sauces on the side as they make the food too tangy to my liking. Apart from the fact that I am packing some pounds, I like everything about them. The longer you wait for your food, the more free falafel samplers you get haha. Definitely try it, call 911 if you can't find the truck because it is an emergency :)",1
3700,10,5,3/17/2014,"After about the 13th snow storm, a polar vortex and arctic wind chills, the sun came out for a day and temps were in the 60's...people were happy, friendlier than usual and an outdoor lunch was in order. I've gone to other carts for chicken and rice, even the famous 53rd & 6th cart, but I must say the King reigns! Â As you are waiting for your food to cook, you are offered a falafel sample. Â It is crispy and tender with a hint of spice and just delicious. Â  The deliciousness doesn't stop there. Â Our food was ready and we Â drove down to the park to enjoy it. Â A large portion of tender juicy chicken loaded with flavor served on top of rice, a side of salad, a falafel all covered with white sauce was pure heaven. I don't know how it could have gotten any better, but this really is the best around and is not to be missed.",1
3701,10,5,3/12/2014,Love this place great food I get the mixed Kofta and chicken in rice because F having to choose Great ppl too,1
3702,10,5,3/9/2014,"Kids! You should be looking for new & exciting (anything) you know and if you don't like falafel or street meat this might be the place to try both! A falafel pita (deep fried chick pea balls) with white sauce and lettuce in a pita is only $5. That's pretty standard fare if you are a New Yorker, but what you might not know about is their new chicken shawarma! Pita $5 plate $7. Chicken on a rotisserie type deal with all kinds of unique spices makes way for a delicious new style of moist chicken! Try it over yellow rice with a little bit of hot sauce, because this hot sauce makes this Mexican sweat. You'll get plenty to share. Thank me later. See you there.",1
3703,10,5,3/8/2014,"If I wasn't so sure that my boyfriend loves me, I would be worried that he would leave me and run off into the sunset for this cart. I wasn't sure why he was so obsessed over this place (for a few weeks every single time i asked what he wanted to eat, his pupils would dilate, mouth began to salivate and he'd be hiding a boner as he would respond ""lamb gyro...falafel king""). Finally caved. As we waited on line the kings passed out free falafel... Great marketing idea considering after one bite i ordered 6 for myself. We both had the lamb gyro. OH... MA... GERD. Ah-mazing. I will never get a gyro from any where else. Thanks king of falafel, not only did you open my eyes to the delicious food, but now I know another to make my man pop a chubby.",1
3704,10,5,3/8/2014,Simply amazing! Â I eat here all the time and it is delicious and on the cheap side too. Â It will ruin you for all the other halal carts in the area.,1
3705,10,5,3/7/2014,The chicken was indeed very flavorful as well as the rice and salad usually if you are lucky enough you might taste 1 or maybe 2 different spices but not so in this case which made me come up with my very own super blend that I am pretty sure will leave your mouth feeling so many different good sensations the falafels were also excellent but unfortunately they sort of left me wanting to eat more even though half of the container of the food had already satisfied my cravings it just made me feel like I was not content at all and believe me I most certainly was however on a lesser note I cannot comment on the tahini sauce as on my way home it spilled out no thanks in part to a very bumpy train ride but not surprisingly though the hot sauce managed to stay fully intact how convenient ps: @King/Freddy if you are reading this my friend I will spending much of my time during the day in the community comes the summer so a special discount sounds just about right yes/no :),1
3706,10,5,3/7/2014,"The best chicken and rice platter anywhere! Falafel is amazing - crunchy on the outside and perfectly seasoned on the inside. You cam't beat the chicken and rice platter. Choose from yellow rice or basmati, and comes with white and red sauce, a full salad with pickled vegetables and a large helping of chicken. Great service, perfect taste and amazing price. Will be back!",1
3707,10,5,3/4/2014,"UMM. YES. this really beats 53rd. I haven't been to 53rd in about 2 years. and no i wasn't even drunk when I had this. The chicken and rice here is bomb. So flavorful, the chicken isn't bland. Even the veggies taste good, it goes so well with the rice. The best part has got to be those falafels. Love them so much, I got an order on the side once. And they even give you one while you're waiting. YUM. The problem is that they're not always open and definitely not open late.",1
3708,10,5,3/2/2014,I love and hate having this cart in the neighbor. Love it because it is delicious but hate it because every time I walk by and smell it I crave it. Seriously yummy. I usually get the chicken wrap and it's a nice sized meal for $5. Guys who work the cart are super nice and will pass out a free falafel if there is any kind of line. They are delicious! Now I'm craving an order of those with a side of white sauce to dip it in.,1
3709,10,5,2/26/2014,The location should be corner of 30st and broadway. Â Love their chicken rice Â  Chicken is juicy and their falafel is taste much better than lot of the place.,1
3710,10,3,2/20/2014,"Don't want to break the hype, but it isn't even close to what the reviews say. Chicken doesn't taste exceptional, Â for the quality it is overpriced. I ended up going to astoria for a try, 7$ a dish, cause of yelp. Ended up with a curry flavored chicken in my mouth that didn't make me go ""OooOoo"" 3 stars are for the people, they're nice :) The best halaal in queens is still Sammys in Jackson Heights",1
3711,10,5,2/14/2014,"Tastes like home. I've got to admit, when it comes to falafel and middle eastern food - NO ONE beats my mom's cooking. Most places leave me disappointed - But this little food stand just does a fantastic job. Their falafel is light and crispy. Their shawarma is well seasoned, juicy, and they don't skimp. Plus, they have all the fixing you'd expect from a full restaurant or your mom's kitchen. The most impressive topping they have is their pickled beets - most places don't carry it but it just adds the right touch of salty/crunchy to any sandwich! The guy that runs the stand was super nice too. On the day I went, the line was long so they offered everyone a piece of falafel while waiting!",1
3712,10,5,2/13/2014,"Best halal food i've ever had. Most other stands are terrible in comparison. I like the types of vegetables they put in their salad & the falafel is always freshly made. Most other stands either don't have or leave it sitting out, I also like that when there's a line they hand some out complimentary.",1
3713,10,5,2/11/2014,"ONE OF THE VERY BEST FOOD CART IN NYC. Back in 2011 I used to live at 29th and Broadway. I had food from here 3-4 days a week(sometimes twice a day). And now if I'm anywhere within 10-15 minutes of distance I stop by the place no matter what. The guys will joke around, they'll say your order wrong to other person to just have a laugh with you. If the wait is long you'll get a complimentary Falafel. They run out of food around 7-8. So, you better hurry...",1
3714,10,5,2/10/2014,"Pretty much the best falafel I've ever had. And when you're waiting for you order to be made, they give you a piece of falafel on the house! The guys are always around so it's super convenient as well.",1
3715,10,5,2/9/2014,"The smell of the cart have invited me several times to try, so I had no choice. Ordered 2 plates and went back home to enjoy a really delicious lunch. The meat is EXCELLENT, the falafel is really well done and the chicken impressive. The amount of food will leave you stuffed for the rest of the day, so save something for the dinner.",1
3716,10,5,1/22/2014,"Honestly, I was skeptical about this place when i heard about it. Then i ventured to astoria with some help from my fellow foodies to track this place down. The absolute best cuts of meat you will get in NYC. Not other cart cuts the meat to order and you can tell it is not the same compressed and chopped crap the others are serving up. The guys on 53rd before they went commercial used to be this good. So was Sammy's in jackson heights, but this place goes the extra mile to impress you with flavor, texture, and right sized portions. I ordered a shwarma plate. Nice cuts of meat served with my choice of basmati or yellow rice. with salad and assorted pickles. Of course topped with white and/or hot sauce. Then as a little extra a nice toasted falafel. This was great. They may charge a little bit more than the other halal places but it is something i am willing to over look because the quality is that much better!",1
3717,10,5,1/15/2014,"First of all, this is the best falafel I have ever eaten. Ever. The guys working there are very friendly and even give out pieces of falafel free of charge while their customers wait for their food. The chicken and rice platter was flavored perfectly and it was huge. It took me until the next day to finish it. Included in the platter was another piece of their falafel, which again, is the best in the world. The pickled radishes add a very pleasant touch that you rarely see. And to top it off, their tahini sauce, just like their falafel, is the greatest you will ever find. Like most people, I really like the Halal Guys on 53rd and 6th. But even the Halal Guys have to bow down to the King of Falafel and Shawarma. The King has a new customer for life. Stop reading this review, get away from your computer and go see the King now!",1
3718,10,5,1/14/2014,This is by far the best halal food I've had in my 29 years of existence. The food is fresh and authentic. I have officially become an addict. If you live or work near by you must check this place out. You won't get disappointed!,1
3719,10,5,1/9/2014,"The amount of white sauce I get in my chicken platter is shameful. Â I see it in their eyes when they serve me--but they never judge me. Â Bless them. This place is just lovely. Â You get a falafel just for waiting in line most times! Â The food is top notch--I usually dislike chicken options and I've never switched back from it at this cart. Â The guys at the cart kind of mess with you too--you'll say no hot sauce and they'll yell ""extra hot sauce!"". Â You have that moment of fear like, ""Is he joking""? Â Really really nice guys. If you're looking for a quick delicious bite try the Chicken Pita, but if you're looking for a meal that you can fall asleep to afterwards, get a platter. Â Also! Â I believe they run out of food early so this is not a late night food truck--this is a classy ass food truck that does not cater to drunkards stumbling home. Â That said--one Friday I got drunk nice and early and was able to enjoy a platter while intoxicated and it may rank in top 5 life experiences.",1
3720,10,5,1/8/2014,"I'm from Atlanta, Georgia where the weather during this time of year is consistently above freezing usually hovering around the 40 F (That's 7C for those of you in the rest of the world). It was about 23 F but weather.com says the windchill makes it feel like 11 F. ELEVEN. I don't even know what to do with my life at that point. I saw the amazing reviews for this place and to display my idiocy I didn't read the reviews and realize it was A FOOD STAND and SUBJECT TO CHANGE PLACES. Seriously, all I had to do was read ONE review to figure this out and I didn't... so instead I dragged my freezing ass around Astoria for about 20 or 30 minutes looking for this elusive restaurant. When I finally did read the first review it said ""food stand"" and I nearly cried. My boyfriend and I stopped by another restaurant (the review will be coming for that) to thaw our extremities and when we were all toasty we made a different walk home and... FOUND THE #$&*ing FOOD STAND. As hilarious as that anecdote is, it has nothing to do with the review, it was just merely an amusing anecdote for entertainment purposes. Tickled and frustrated by our excursion my boyfriend and I ordered the ever so talked about chicken platter and Kefta hero (or something) and shuffled home half-laughing/half-fuming about the way life works sometimes. For our previous meal we paid roughly about $35 for the meal tip included and got a relatively fair portion and decent food. Here however, we paid $13 and got a sizable meal that looked like the after effects of a college frat party but tasted amazing. Why is it that way? Why is it some of the most horrendous looking food is the best tasting? The chicken platter was spicy, spicier than I thought it would be and that made me a very happy person. This food stand is awesome; the men in the tent smiled and joked with me about the weather, they served the food better than some restaurants I've been to. All in all, it's a good start for my trip to New York despite the minor hiccup.",1
3721,10,5,1/4/2014,Best Halal food cart ever!. These guys always have a huge line and the food is worth it. They jam pack every platter which ia enough food for 2. The food is always fresh and taste fantastic down to all the seasonings. My fav is the platter that comes with both kefta and chicken over rice my fav!. The white sauce ia the bomb also!! They also hook you up with a free falafal piece while you wait in line and also in your food! The prices cant be beat. check these guys out if you are in the area for sure.,1
3722,10,5,12/22/2013,"Wow! Just some of the best shawarma and services I've had in a long time. I am usually not a connoisseur of food carts, but I can attest that after trying the Chicken Platter from these guys and comparing to the ""Halal Guys,"" the competition is unfair and completely one-sided in favor to the Kings. My girlfriend and I wandered towards this lonely cart, initially seeking for the Halal Guys, not knowing that they only operated at night. However, it took no more than a few whiffs of the amazing smell from the cart before we started lining up for a taste of the delicious famous street food. While we waited, one of the chefs kindly took the felafel that just came from the pot of boiling oil and handed it to all of the customers waiting in line. Not only was the felafel delicious, but the overwhelming generosity made the rest of the meal taste just that much better. Now onto the actual chicken dish, the chicken was succulent, delicious and chock full of flavor, especially served on the seasoned rice with white and hot sauce.The felafel sandwich was also quite delicious as we see the freshly made chickpea balls get smooshed inside the sandwiches before it was smothered with all sorts of goodies and condiments. The only thing that would make this place even better is if the portions were slightly larger, but hey, it's the quality that matters! Overall, if I had to choose between the Kings and the Halal Guys, it's a no brainer. Kings beat all competition! Food: 5 stars Price: 4 stars Service: 5 stars",1

Â There's nothing to say that hasn't been said already, but I'll reiterate the main points - it's cheap, super fast (I was impressed by the team working there; with a line of eight or so of us, it still took me less than five minutes to get my food), and delicious!",1

3727,10,5,12/4/2013,"They now have a cart at approximately 33rd St. and 30th Ave in Astoria as well. And it's amazing. And really reasonably priced. And amazing. (And for those comparing, this is REMARKABLY better than the taco truck that sits near it. They're not even in the same league)",1
3728,10,5,12/2/2013,Most perfect falafel you'll get around here but don't stop there. The chicken wrap is blissfully good. And if there's a long line they usually pass out falafel balls for free. So cool that they have a new cart on 30th but idk if anyone really goes there yet.,1
3729,10,5,12/2/2013,"Holly ... !!! I am a fan! I am loving it! If it was around my neighborhood I would be eating this every day. I've had the shawarma platter with rice and salad and it was awesome. Guys are very friendly and make it fast. On the platter: pieces of very flavorful meat cooked rice white sauce and salad, iceberg but I didn't mind it slices of tomatoes onion pickles and pickled beets. One falafel on plate and one during the time of waiting. Savory sour juicy fresh and delicious food I can't stop thinking when i will have next available day to go to Astoria and have the hot shawarma on the freezing cold. For some reason I think that during the winter that kind of food just taste better. Guys if u have the opportunity go and get it! You won't be disappointed!",1
3730,10,5,11/27/2013,"The King of Falafel & Shawarma, What a fitting name! I recently paid a visit to this popular food court err I meant cart and the kings certainly live up to their name! You will find their cart on 30th and Broadway, not far from the N & Q Broadway station. As with all good carts, you can always spot them with the line of hungry people. The best part about waiting in line is that they give you a free falafel as you wait to order. This was by far one of the best falafels I've had in a long time. So fresh! The menu is posted on a railing opposite of the line and food cart. Â The prices are $3-$4 more than most chicken and rice carts but the Kings of Falafel give you a TON of quality delicious food. Wraps and kebobs are about average prices. The men are friendly and open to prepare your plate just the way you like. I ordered the Omar platter and asked for kinda spicy but not volcanic which came with a salad and 2 more falafels!!! Like most foodies, I quickly paid for my meal and raced back to my apartment to enjoy the meal. Everything was delicious and cooked just right. Not sure how but I managed to not eat it all in one sitting and saved half fo lunch the next day. Â Highly recommend The Kings and look forward to returning for more but mostly the falafels. Check it out if you're in the area. It's definitely worth it!",1
3731,10,4,11/27/2013,He really is the King. I've been here several times and he always provides great service. It's too bad his employees don't. I asked one of his employees for a side of tahini. He charged me $2 which I thought was pretty steep for Tahini. Then when I get home I saw he gave me falafels. How he got 2 falafels from side of tahini. I'll never know.,1
3732,10,5,11/26/2013,Best falafel in the game!,1
3733,10,5,11/21/2013,"The chicken over rice is simply phenomenal, the service is fast and attentive. The portions you receive are well worth the money you spend. The taste is bar none, this is definitely the BEST chicken and rice place in all of NYC!",1
3734,10,5,11/15/2013,He calls himself the King of Falafel & Shawarma for a reason.,1
3735,10,5,11/13/2013,"Amazing food. I ordered the chicken platter and was more than satisfied with my choice. They give you a large portion for the price and it was enough food for dinner and lunch the next day. Alas, it didn't last that long for me since it was so delicious I ate it all, ignoring the feeling of gluttony. The icing on the cake: they give you a free falafel while your waiting on (a short for the time I went) line.",1
3736,10,5,11/11/2013,"So good! Had the best chicken platter ever, with an amazing zingy white sauce. And the falafel was cooked to perfection, crispy and not greasy. Â Heaven!",1
3737,10,4,11/6/2013,"Pros: Great quality food, the lamb shwarma looks like real meat not like the mystery meat like most hallal karts. The salad especially the onions taste super fresh. Excellent customer service too; the guys gave us free fallafel samples to people waiting in line. Small gesture, big return/ influence on customer loyalty and repat business. Cons: Not really cons. But platter is not as big as most hallal karts, but still plenty to get you stuffed. They charge $2-$3 more than traditional halal karts, but quality is definately noticeable.",1
3738,10,5,11/6/2013,"Best HALAL CART food in NYC. Service is friendly. Prices are ok, wish they were a bit lower. (Says the guy who spends 5 bucks on a latte)",1
3739,10,5,11/5/2013,"While this is not the best falafel I have had in the world, IT WAS IN VIENA, AUSTRIA if you can believe that, these guys get points for 1. Being rugged ass falafel guys. They all look like they just got out of some gangster military training. 2. They are all incredibly friendly. On more than one occasion I received a fresh falafel ball to munch on while I wait for my order. 3. Being a true New York experience in Queens!! Let Brooklyn have all the hipster foo foo places! We have you guys!",1
3740,10,5,11/1/2013,"OMG, CALL 911! Â I'm afraid I might go into a food coma! Finding this cart and meeting the owner added a pleasant memory to my Queens NY experience. Not only is the food a great value it's exceptionally tasty as well. But wait, it gets better! The owner drove me back to my hotel! So here I am enjoying my meal while watching the sunset behind the Manhatten skyline. I highly recommend this cart. Wow, this is a great meal!",1
3741,10,5,11/1/2013,"Love their food. Â OMG it's so good, that I even ate the pickled beets !!! I never eat beets...sigh",1
3742,10,5,10/28/2013,Absolutely the best 10 bucks you can spend in Astoria. Â Chicken platter with a kebob. Â Feeds 2 easy. Get extra picked veggies. Â The King for a reason. Always treat you right and give you what you ask for. Next object. Â Free Falafal while you wait in line. Â These guys are amazing. Â Get extra white sauce and normal red. Â It's spicy!!! Too much will ruin the plate. Â Enjoy!!,1
3743,10,5,10/21/2013,"By far the best chicken on rice/chicken wrap ever!! I love how they add the pickled turnips to their food.. And don't get me started on how nice the guys are, giving out free falafels when the line is a bit long, which in turn makes us even more hungry. I only wish I could have this everyday!",1
3744,10,5,10/17/2013,"Absolutely the best vendor chicken I've ever tasted! It was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, yet it was very well-done, just how I like my chicken. Â The pita was soft and fresh. Â The service was very friendly, and Â I was offered a falafel appetizer as I waited. Â  Best vendor experience ever!",1
3745,10,5,10/13/2013,"4.5 Stars. This is my go to halal cart in Astoria, and one of the best chicken & rice in NYC. Â Why? Â The BEST salad which includes some pickled beets, falafel, and seasonal onions or tomatoes with lettuce. Â the chicken is well seasoned and tasty. Half a star off since they recently raised the prices to $7 which is premium considering most halal carts are $5, but to some extent they deserve the premium from the more interesting salad and the bigger seasoned chicken chunks. Also they pass out free falafels to the line which is cool.",1
3746,10,5,10/10/2013,"this food truck has been here for years since i have graduated high school a few years back and i would always walk by this stand on the way home after school. back then i wasnt into this type of food till a friend of mines that lives in the area said to try and since i have gotten food here and one of the very few i would eat from, there are many food trucks but not quite like this one, the photos that i have posted and others speak for it self. the waiting line can get crazy at times at anytime of the day between lunch and dinner. these guys that work on this stand are very friendly and love to serve there customers. my favorite platers are chicken over rice and saled platter and falafel over rice and saled platter some of the best food i have ever had, i also get the falafel pita raps which are also delicious. they also very good gyros and other platters. whenever im visiting my friend i always stop by and get something. if your in the area and looking for really good falafel go here youll see why there called king of falafel & shawarma. 5 stars!!!!",1
3747,10,5,10/5/2013,"As has been said by other Yelpers, this place is crazy tasty. Â Chicken and rice and falafel are my favorite in NYC. Â Love the sauces and the salad/pickles. Â It is very much worth the wait, and you will be craving it for days after!",1
3748,10,2,9/29/2013,Got the beef and lamb shawarma. Blah. Â Meat was dry and lacked flavor. Â The rice was blah. Â The salad had beets that looked like they were artificially colored. Â Maybe I should have got the chicken because clearly is their focus.,1
3749,10,4,9/17/2013,"Yesssss. Â They are the KING of Halal carts. Â I absolutely love coming here and LOVE LOVE their falafel. Â Try it, you won't regret coming here. Â There are so many different places to try out around the Broadway stop anyway that even if you don't like this cart, there's something else you can find. Â Have fun!",1
3750,10,5,9/3/2013,"There is something about this food cart that separates them from the rest. Perhaps it's because you're given a falafel as appetizer as you stand in line, or how much these guys love making and sharing their food or how freaking fantastic their food actually is is--I think it's a combination and that's why I love them so. I've passed this truck countless times and have always wanted to get in line with the rest of the people...one day I did, and my goodness, I am so glad that I did! THE LONG LINES DON'T LIE! It is worth the wait--the falafel is greatly flavored, crispy yet soft at the same time, their chicken is fan-freaking-tastic and their pitas are always light and soft. If you live in Astoria, take the time to wait in line and grab a really kick-ass cheap lunch/dinner.",1
3751,10,5,8/19/2013,"This place is fantastic. I have always passed this great food cart and there is always a thick cluster of people outside of it waiting patiently for their falafel or their kebab or their chicken gyro or whatever they are having, and these people always seem willing to wait. I finally checked this place out with my girlfriend and was enraptured with how the employees dealt with myself, they gave us a free falafel sample, how they received our order, with smiles, grins, and jokes, and how good the food was. That chicken gyro. Sweet Baby Jesus, is it delicious. Like nothing I have ever tasted before. Oh me oh my oh lordy. I don't know what type of spices and marinades they used for that chicken but with the white sauce it was just fantastic. Â It was tender, moist, and just damn stucculent.",1
3752,10,5,8/16/2013,I eat this every time when I don't know what to eat. Yayyyyy!,1
3753,10,5,8/15/2013,"I love it! These guys are so quick and so friendly. I even got some free falafel while I was waiting in line last time. My husband and I have tried several different things here, but we keep coming back for the Freddy's Junior! The kefta is so rich and flavorful and the chicken is tender and delicious. They give you a choice of yellow or basmati rice and always ask if you want hot sauce and white sauce. We always get it with everything! The falafel is the best I've had in NYC. I crave this stuff, it's so good. I always bring my friends and family here when they visit. And now on to Freddy himself. He's such an awesome guy! I've had the pleasure of chatting with him on several occasions, and he is such a friendly man...always smiling. I will recommend this food cart to everyone that I know!",1
3754,10,5,8/13/2013,Now I never liked falafel since the first time I tried it. Man I tell you these guys changed my taste buds around! Â It was my first time so I went with the chicken platter even though there were other two platters that caught my eye. Â The chicken was very flavorful!,1
3755,10,5,8/8/2013,"This place has the best falafel I have ever eaten in my life. The staff is really friendly and the shawarma is great. I come here every time I pass by Astoria, It really is the best cart I have eaten from and that's saying a lot considering how many carts there are in NYC.",1
3756,10,4,8/6/2013,"In my opinion, this is the best street meat in all of NYC. I have never tried the shawarma, but the chicken and rice and falafel are outstanding. They are both packed with flavor. I usually go for the yellow rice, which is moist and savory. The chicken is juicy and you can tell has been marinating for hours. I also like the crisp pickled veggies they serve with it. The falafael is very unique. It's oblong and crispy on the outside, but moist and creamy on the inside. Usually they will make them right in front of you and give you a sample while you wait. The line can be quite long, but it moves quickly. You get a ton of delicous food and it's super cheap.",1
3757,10,4,7/22/2013,Amazing Falafel; have had better shawarma. Clean and fast service. Inexpensive. I will come back again for the falafel; still thinking about it months later!,1
3758,10,5,7/19/2013,"Best falafel of all time! Granted, I'd never tried this chickpea-ed godsend until 2 years ago, this has been the most unique and best tasting. They're like mozzarella sticks, but with chickpeas instead of cheese. They make and fry them right in front of you too! Also, if you wait in line for a while, they hand out a piece of falafel to you. The first time I went, I got the shawarma, which was just alright, it would have warranted 3 stars: was a bit dry and too salty for my taste. I recently discovered they are down the block from my gym, so things can get dangerous realllllly fast. For $4, that falafel sandwich is amazing! The rest of their prices are about $1 more than the rest of the halal trucks, but the portions are about equal, if not bigger, and the quality is top notch as far as halal trucks are concerned.",1
3759,10,4,7/18/2013,"Food was pretty good, I was amazed. I usually don't eat of a truck but took a chance. Only complaint was that it could have been cleaner. But It's understandable, there's barely any room in the thing to move around, so it goes.",1
3760,10,2,7/12/2013,"Arrghhh. I so badly want to give this place 5 stars. At the same time I want to give it 1 star. Before you stone me, let me explain! The food here is OUTSTANDING. I had chicken over rice that was perfectly cooked and ridiculously flavorful. Five stars by any normal account. While waiting on line they even gave us a free piece of falafel. You will never find a crispier falafel anywhere. The only con to it was that it was actually on the dry side. Why the minus stars? They're freakin' -filthy-! Dude. I don't give a damn about eating food off a street cart, or tamales made by some old Spanish lady's bare hands, or rice cakes cooked by some Chinese woman in a store front that's the size of my closet. That's normally great, authentic, culturally rich food. And I've eaten some very questionable food in my time. I was raised Filipino, where i learned to ""pick off the bad parts and eat the rest."" My stomach may not be totally made of iron, but I can handle food from a place the Dept. of Health would rate a C (you can get away with a lot and still get an A/B, I worked in the food bizz for a few years). The problem here is that none of these dudes changed their gloves once. I saw them stick their hands in raw falafel mix, handle cash money, and the -worst- offense, handle a filthy garbage container covered in wet rancid scrap-food mess to dump it into the nasty C-town dumpster a few yards away. AND NEVER CHANGED THEIR GLOVES. And then! stick their hands in a basket of cooked falafel to hand it as samples to people waiting on line! Wtf! I didn't finish my chicken platter the night I got it because: a) It was very filling and b) I was busy peeing out of my ass after eating it. BUT. Just to convey how delicious the food was, I STILL ate some of the left overs the next day because: a) It was delicious b) Someone stole my lunch at work and I didn't eat anything all day. Famished, I risked it a second time. Yes, stupid, my fault, and like damn clockwork I found myself pooping out everything I just consumed. On the plus side, this could be a really great diet. You get to eat amazing food and dump it all out before your body gets to absorb any calories. Seriously, if it wasn't for their complete lack of hygienic practices, this place would easily be five stars. Come here if you like the combination of tasty street food and playing the exhilarating game of seeing how long you can hold your diarrhea before crapping your pants. PS. Ask them to change their gloves.",1
3761,10,5,7/8/2013,"Definitely try the chicken & rice platter! Â The first time I came, I tried the lamb with rice but it wasn't as good as the 53rd street cart. Â The chicken on the other hand is delicious and extremely filling. Â The white sauce makes it addicting. Â It comes with two falafels and while waiting in line, the guy served me a free one. Â The falafels are a little too deep friend for me but otherwise good. Â The guys at the cart are characters and they know it!",1
3762,10,3,6/30/2013,"Stopped by during lunch with a seemingly long line, but it went pretty fast. We were also given a falafel while waiting. Falafel was one of the best I've had. But, I decided to try their shawarma. Bad decision at it was just okay. Get their falafel, don't make the mistake I did!",1
3763,10,5,6/27/2013,"Hands down the best chicken pita wrap ever! Â I live in the bronx and have contemplated moving to queens to be closer :) Â One of those drippy things you never forget. Â Freddy is awesome. Â  The pickled veggies, hot sauce and white sauce are ""must haves!"" Don't skip them. Â Get the full Monty and your belly will be happy for about 7 hours!",1
3764,10,3,6/14/2013,This place is definitely one of the more solid food carts around. They rarely disappoint and the portions are hefty for the price tag. Guys are always nice too. Recommend.,1
3765,10,5,6/11/2013,"Gotta be one of the best Falafel spots in the city! Â These guys are complete gentlemen, the food is absolutely amazing!",1
3766,10,5,6/8/2013,Best falafel I have ever had. The vegetables are also nice and fresh. Excellent spice and seasoning in all of their food. Everything I have had from here is very good.,1
3767,10,3,6/7/2013,OK so I can only rate the falafel and it is more like 3.5 stars. The taste is good and sometimes while you wait on line they give you a free sample of falafel. The price used to be just right at $3 since the ingredients don't cost too much. But recently it has gone up a buck to $4. Â Although the taste is the same and the size remains the same I don't understand the price hike. But I did notice the crowds are thinning and I guess that is because others are also price senstive. Â It is a decent choice for lunch so I would go back if in the mood for falafel.,1
3768,10,5,6/1/2013,"This is the first time I can say I have eaten a street cart that puts it to 53rd and 6th. Â I didn't think I'd ever see a Halal cart that consistently pushes out better platters than them. Â However walking home one day recently from worked I noticed the old cart on 30th ave. beside El Rey has been replaced by King of Falafel! They are usually handed out their uniquely shaped falafel pieces to street-goers in a delicious attempt to lure you into their amazing platters. Â This place serves up the most amazing platter ever, they don't just dish out a crappy salad mix to your plate, they add a real delicious salad along with your falafel, chicken, or beef. They aren't open anywhere as late as El Rey, so, make sure to get your fix pretty early, otherwise you're going to be stuck with the #1 taco truck Â However this place is one of those ultimate places where vegetarians and meat eaters can always agree to get an amazing giant platter of Halal. Best Halal street cart in NYC as far as I know.",1
3769,10,2,5/28/2013,The chicken and rice is actually pretty decent. The two star rating is because they have some shady practices. They'll charge you $7 for it if they can tell it's your first time when they charge others $6 (read the recent reviews).,1
3770,10,5,5/28/2013,"Best falafel I've ever had, hands down. Â I always liked falafel fine but never really loved them till I tried the King's little deep-fried tubes of goodness. Â I usually get the falafel platter so I can OD on those suckers. Â Their chicken doesn't quite live up to the 53rd & 6th Halal Guys, but their lamb is pretty good and the other platters also come with a little falafel treat. Â Everything's cheap, delicious, and comes with lots of pickles for us pickle lovers. Â Plus, Freddy and the guys are super friendly and will often hand you a falafel to munch on while you wait on line. Â Be forewarned that they close at 9 on Mon-Sat and at 6 on Sun. Â Don't be a sucker like me and get a craving at 10pm, because you'll be left unsatisfied... Their 2010 Vendy was well deserved, and it's awesome that they've opened a new cart in Midtown!",1
3771,10,5,5/25/2013,Best chicken over rice ever!! They are fast too. I'm so thankful that I live in the area.,1
3772,10,5,5/24/2013,"Where have you been all my life? Thank God I found YOU!!!...right in from of C-Town *Cue in cheesy Indian music*...followed by me dancing straight into a pile of... Hot... Moist... Tender... Chicken & Lamb w/ yellow rice, purple pickled beets, turnips, and onions. Â  Do I even need sauce? NO. Did I ask for it anyway? YES. The guys that work here talk to every customer but more so to make you feel right at home. Listening to these guys crack jokes and interact with customers makes me just want to come back often with return visits. So friendly and so nice while handing out FREE falafel balls to keep your hunger at bay, Michael. I posted a picture up so you can see exactly how Halal food is supposed to look like. Â  Believe you and me, the taste was EVEN BETTER. *****VENDY AWARDS AND PEOPLE'S CHOICE***** My only quip is that they close early and is a little out of my way. They do have a Manhattan location but it is only open fora 2 hrs during lunch time. When they stay open later and have a designated Manhattan location watch out all you imposters... THE KING IS HERE and his name is... KING FALAFEL & SHAWARMA. I wonder if they deliver... Kidding, Maybe.",1
3773,10,5,5/23/2013,"Easily the best falafel in Astoria and maybe even New York City. The food is cheap, delicious, and service is fast and friendly. The sandwich melts in your mouth and, after one bite, you will be addicted to the point where you will salivate like a dog every time you pass by the cart. In fact, just thinking about their falafel will induce a euphoric and primal state within you. The other day, the most wonderful thing happened: King of Falafel and Shawarma opened a new location on 30th avenue and 33rd street, in my neighborhood! Oh! I'm so excited! What a wonderful world we live in! I'm going to run over and buy a falafel sandwich now! brb",1
2771,10,5,5/19/2013,"I can honestly say that this cart is FAR better than 53rd and 6th, and I've been a huge fan of 53rd and 6th. How so uneducated I was. Platter comes with yummy falafel, tender meat (juicy, not dry), tomatos, salad, pickled beets/turnips and onions. I love that it's actually a salad and not just old lettuce. It's decently priced at $6 and well portioned for having leftovers. It's also freaking far as hell, but I'm glad I was introduced to this cart.",1
3774,10,4,5/15/2013,"The food speaks for itself: its cheap and good Winner of the 2010 vendy awards, Â this food cart is probably one of the best halal carts this side of the east river and not named ""halal guys."" Â  Giving you options than most halal carts, you'll find some of the best falafel and shawarma here. On top of that, the owner, who you'll often see out there working the lines will greet you with a smile and joke as you'll most likely be in a line waiting to be next. Don't be afraid as the line moves quickly and from time to time the owner will even give free falafel samples to everyone in line! Awesome food and awesome service, what else can you ask for! Definitely a try and drive out there.",1
1790,10,5,5/8/2013,These guys are the best! It quite possibly is the best Halal food I've ever had. The best chicken and rice at least. Be prepared to wait in line; it can be long. But if you're lucky the guys sometimes give away falafels while you wait. Cheap food that's definitely worth waiting for. Definitely worth walking to in your PJs even!,1
3775,10,5,4/29/2013,THE CHICKEN PLATTER IS OUT OF THIS WORLD! I will be coming back just for this dish. Also very tasty authentic falafel. One of the top ten meals I've had in a long time. A must stop when your in Astoria.,1
3776,10,5,4/27/2013,"we got falafel salad, shawarma sandwich, and the Omar plate. Â  all delicious. Â  - falafels were freshly fried. Â crispy on the outside and tender inside - picked veggies were amazing - portions were generous - guys at the cart were friendly - price is right we will be back for sure",1
3777,10,5,4/12/2013,To anyone who wonders what authentic falafel tastes like--THIS IS IT!! it is BETTER than the one on 6th and 53rd street in midtown. I live miles away from this place and venture out just to eat from this cart. the vegetables are fresh and they even had pickled turnips(the pink veggies) just like in Egypt. Â The falafel is fresh and as I mention before tastes like the ones in the old country. Love this place,1
1931,10,4,4/9/2013,"It just keeps getting better, or maybe I'm getting better at coming when its fresh! Falafels are definitely the winner here, my bf usually gets lamb/chicken at Halal carts but he is a falafel convert here. I love that they throw a couple pieces of lettuce, tomato and onion and call it salad so I can convince myself I'm eating healthy :P Actually, the rice and the falafels here are pretty dense, so the veggies actually offer up some balance and complement the falafel well. The Yellow rice is definitely better than the other one. Just make sure to ask for extra white sauce and hot sauce!",1
3778,10,4,4/6/2013,"Well, One day going to my aunts and I was so hungry that the only thing I could thing and smell was FALAFEL, so since I hear it was the best in NYC, I was willing to give it a try. I bought only like 4 and they were great. I will have to come back to try some new things but it's very, very good. Go, go!",1
3779,10,4,4/2/2013,"Saw sooo many good reviews on this place and thought I'd check it out. Â  The line moves fast and the great part was when I was waiting on line, the guys working there just gave out free falafels for people waiting on line! Super awesome and super delicious!!! I wanted to get a lamb and rice though, which the platter came with a falafel or two anyways. Â The rice you had a choice of yellow or white, and for the salad it was a nice mixture, looked like pickled beets or onions either way I ate them and they were YUM. Â The lamb was legit lamb, not beef mixture or questionable surprise meat, but lamb. Â The price for it was $1 more than what I'm used to. Â But I'll definitely get the falafel sandwich next time!",1
3780,10,5,3/29/2013,YES! They are most definitely named correctly!! They are the bomb dot com ~ amazing chicken and rice. It is no joke. Prices are superkickawesome!,1
3781,10,5,3/28/2013,"I've been a die hard 53rd and 6'er for as long as I can remember. Boy, am I glad I finally checked this place out. If I were to compare these two establishments, 53rd and 6 would be a McDonald's Hamburger and King of Falafel & Shawarma would be a Peter Luger steak dinner. By far the best halal I have ever had!!! Incredibly flavorful lamb and chicken - no grizzle or fatty chunks could be found! The rice was bursting with flavor too, cooked perfectly. Their falafel puts other falafel carts to shame. The white sauce was not as thick and heavy as usual, I really enjoyed how it complimented the other flavors. Oh yeah, and they actually do a semi-real salad... Lettuce, tomatoes, tons of onion and peppers, even a good bit of beets! Dope as hell.",1

3783,10,5,2/13/2013,"I love King of Falafel & Shawarma. If I didn't pass it regularly, I'd probably go out of my way to get it. It is deserving of all its accolades. The food is always delicious and cheap, the king and his men quick and friendly. I recommend the basmati over the yellow rice. Hot sauce, white sauce, for the win.",1

3785,10,4,2/6/2013,"A few steps down from the Broadway stop and a recommendation from Kuwait raised girlfriend. The cart is right in front of the C-Town...which, well if you've never been there it's a cringe worthy experience. King of Falafel's location has nothing to do with its quality though. The chicken pita wrap is fresh made, and takes no time. The falafel takes some time to fry up, which may or may not be a big deal depending on how cold it is. I paid with a $20 and expected half of it back but I was pleasantly shocked to know I got more than 10 bucks back, for that alone it's worth to drop a dollar or two in their cup; a good use for their 2010 Vendy cup trophy. The chicken pita was tasty and delicious and the fact that it was only a Lincoln really boosts it. Honestly, a good deal and a tasty sandwich-and if you're willing to wait for a good falafel.",1
3786,10,4,1/30/2013,"One of the best food carts in all of New York, and I think they were voted best in the city in 2010. Ridiculously cheap, and everything is delicious. The chicken, lamb, and falafel are all great choices. Long may it live and prosper on this corner.",1
3787,10,5,1/19/2013,"Oh god, this place is so freaking delicious, I'm just sad it's not in Astoria every day. Maybe that's a good thing, considering that I would get its food way too often. The location is pretty genius. Right after you get off of the Broadway station from the N and Q train, if you picked the right exit, you could smell its deliciousness right away. I always saw it as I walked to and from C-Town, but one day I just couldn't hold it any longer and I had to stop to try it, even though I had ice cream melting in my shopping bags. I was sad to see that the price of the chicken plate was $6, but I guess that's just me being a bit shiesty (the first few times I visited New York, my friend took me to get chicken and rice and it was only $5. Okay, only a buck difference, bite me). I ordered the chicken plate to go and brought it back to my apartment. First of all, the smell was SO overpowering, and in a good way! My entire room smelled like a Halal cart, and when I'm eating, I like the scent to be a part of that experience. The chicken was more shredded than I'm used to (normally they were more chunky the last two or three times I had it before), so I was a bit skeptical, but man, it was delicious! The rice definitely tasted more fresh than the other places and the chicken was so soft! Needless to say, the white sauce was perfection (when is it not?) though I can't say much for the hot sauce, since I avoided it. I was also excited to see the falafel in there, and thought I got lucky, but checked online to see that it came free with the platter. Eh, still yummy! I went back two more times for the chicken plate before I braved it to spend one more buck on the Freddy Junior, which is the combo of chicken and kefta (kefka? Kafka? I don't know) but it's some sort of ground hamburger beef. It was really good! I think I prefer the chicken platter slightly because of it's consistent consistency (not redundant!), but both are excellent dishes! I'll definitely keep stopping by this place and recommend everyone to at least try it once!",1

Not toasted, kinda stale texture.",1

Â  Let's get to the food. Â The chicken has so much flavor to it. Â It's not dry at all. Â Usually, most halal carts add some lettuce and a piece of tomato. Â This place actually adds a 'real' salad including pickled veggies. Â And ask for the hot sauce. Â It's not overbearing hot but a good flavor to it.",1

It'll definitely fill you up! $5 for chicken & rice platter",1

3798,10,5,11/2/2012,"I've tried almost everything they got and they never fail to impress me. Excellent quality and awesome taste. Chicken wrap, Shawarma are my favorite.

Â If you want to absolutely gorge yourself on flavor go for the Omar Plate and try a little of everything. All menu items are plentiful for lunch but get there early for dinner or the good stuff will be gone.

Been thinking about it all night and finally succumbed to chicken and rice deliciousness when I woke up! Huge portions - good enough for two meals and I'm a girl who can eat! Back when I lived in Boston and used to come to NY for business, I used to take the subway to Astoria just to get some tasty goodness from the King. Seriously. They close at 9pm btw. And I love that they give out samples of freshly fried falafel while you're waiting for your meal to be plated! The guys are also sweethearts.

I love falafel, and it's very, very easy for me to say that this is the best falafel I've ever had. The portions for the plates are gigantic. I usually get the Omar plate (chicken and gyro) and I'm never disappointed. The best is when they hand out a perfectly hot and delicious falafel to everyone who's waiting on line. Oh man. The price is great -- so much food for so little money. I will literally take any excuse to go here, especially since it's only a block from my apartment. I love the all caps menu signage...

3813,10,4,9/6/2012,"Winner of both the 2010 Vendy Award and People's Choice Award, recognizing the best street food in New York City, King of Falafel and Shawarma doesn't look like much. However, give it a try and the food, along with its personality, show why it won these awards. Located on the corner of 30th Street and Broadway in Astoria, this food cart appears to be just your usual falafel cart. My choice order is the chicken platter. Served with yellow rice, loads of chicken, a complimentary falafel, and lots of white and red sauce (I forgo the usual salad that comes with it because who wants to be that healthy?), this meal is sure to leave anyone stuffed. The falafel is delicious and has a crispy outside while at the same time remaining soft and moist on the inside. While the chicken platter is arguably not much different than what you'd get at other food stands, King of Falafel sets itself apart in the personality of its workers. Owner Freddy Zeidaies along with his entire staff are some of the happiest food vendors I've ever met. Joking around with customers and just having plain fun. Freddy values his customers and treats them very well. If there is a long line, the staff will gladly walk up and down the line handing out free falafel to everyone while they wait. The platters also come with a falafel - something I've never gotten at any other food carts. It's these nice little touches that keep people coming back.",1
3814,10,5,9/4/2012,"Every time I pass this cart on Broadway I come very close to ordering something but usually restrain myself in an impressive feat of self-control. King of Falafel has the best falafel, that's it. It's perfectly seasoned and crispy and they give you a free one while you wait on line. My favorite dish from the cart though is the Freddy Jr Platter which is a mix of chicken and beef over rice with a white sauce, pickled vegetables and hot sauce. For $7 it can feed you for 3 meals. The meat is so juicy and flavorful and when mixed with yellow rice and that white cream sauce, it's really crazy good. The guys who work here are super nice too!",1
3815,10,2,8/27/2012,Not the best in the city. Â Whats going on with these reviews. Â I'd say the place is slightly below average. Â Didn't like seeing the guy handle money and food with same bare hands over and over.,1

The King's food has received well-deserved accolades, including a Vendy Award, but the Astoria locals lined up at the cart at any hour of the day seem like the true measure of its success. Try the extraordinarily crispy falafel, of course, but don't miss the perfectly seasoned chicken of rice (and say ""yes"" to the salad of pickled veggies on the side). Â On days when I am super hungry, I go for the ""Freddy's Junior,"" chicken and kefta doused in tahini (hot sauce optional, but recommended by the King). Don't miss this place, Astoria.",1

3820,10,3,8/3/2012,"I just finished eating my meal so I thought it would be the perfect time to write a revIew for this place since my belly is full. Â What to say about this 2010 Vendy awarded food cart? Â I had a chicken platter for $6 while my brother had an Omar plate (which is just a combo of chicken and shawarma) for $8. Â For those of you that don't know, shawarma is lamb cooked with onions, peppers and various spices. Â  While waiting online, one of the guys that work the cart offered my brother and I a free falafel which I thought was really nice. Â And yes, they really do make those suckers fresh. Â There's a fryer in their food cart just for frying these things! Â Flavor-wise, I was expecting more from the falafel. Â I thought it would be more heavily spiced but it did have a nice crunch on the outside and a somewhat softer interior. Â They were definitely NOT dry at all. Chicken Platter - Portion was huge and you could (and probably should) make two meals of it. Â This meal is basically yellow (or brown) rice with finely shredded spiced chicken on top. Â They also give you a salad of lettuce, onions, and tomato on the side as well as some of their pickled radish, I believe. Â The pickled radish was very salty. Â Also came with 1 falafel. Â The mayo-based white sauce was squirted over the top so that you would have some sauce with each bite you take. Â Hot sauce is also offered. Â  As with the falafel, spices were lacking. Â Again, I expected this dish to be more heavily flavored but it was actually very light in terms of flavor. Â However, the meal itself was quite heavy/filling due to the mayo-based white sauce. Omar Plate (review courtesy of my brother) - it was edible. Overall, I would say the value was good but the flavors were nothing special. Â It was edible. =D",1
3821,10,4,8/2/2012,"Chicken plate for $6? Uh, yes! It's enough food for lunch AND dinner! Plus a free falafel patty while you wait? AND all the guys are super-nice?? Done, done, and done. And that's not even scratching the surface on how delicious it is. Absolutely worth a trip. If you're in Astoria and you want something quick to eat, this is a no-brainer.",1
3822,10,5,7/20/2012,"If I could eat here every day, no doubt that I would. I'm pretty sure living less than a block away from this place is dangerous to my health, unless they've finally proven that a shawarma-only diet is the key to immortality (in which case, why didn't anyone tell me?) Best falafel I'll ever had. It's not too finely ground, the interior is a little chunkier which makes it the perfect texture. They're also cylindrical rather than round, which is both amusing and delicious. They're always piping hot and perfectly crispy, plus Freddie often passes them out for free to people in line if the wait is long. Plus they put one falafel, and often two, in with your meal. The first thing that that got me hooked was the chicken and rice. A heap of succulent chicken on top of a huge portion of yellow rice with salad, hot sauce and white sauce. For only six dollars, it's a huge amount of food. Then my boyfriend enlightened me about the omar plate and now I'm really hooked. Chicken, kebab, rice, pitas, all mixed together into the most amazing concoction you'd ever tasted. Â Seriously. The line is often long but it's totally worth it. Â All the guys are nice, the food is incredible and cheap. Oh, and they have THE funniest menu signs. Â You can see it on their webpage too. Â They say things like ""go for it"" ""yahh baby"" and ""don't feel guilty."" Â I just think they are too funny and I always get a kick out of reading them while I wait in line.",1
3823,10,3,7/12/2012,"3.5 stars. This place is a tad bit more expensive than your typical halal cart. Chicken over rice is about $6. The white sauce is actually tahini sauce; it's not the typical white sauce that most halal carts have. And the salad included pickles. Oh, and each gyro comes with 1 piece of falafel. I thought the food was good. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. The falafel was crisp on the outside, and had great texture on the inside as well. The guys are pretty nice. I asked them to put more chicken and less rice in 2 of the gyros, and they said they can do it for all 3 if I'd like; I thought that was pretty generous of them. The food wasn't incredible/amazing, though, and so I don't quite understand the hype. Granted, I still need to try the other things they offer, so I will be back when I'm in the area. Warning - stand back when they are chopping the chicken on the grill. Things tend to fly...",1

Look at these dumb people waiting 15 mins in the rain to get halal food just like those midtown suckers. I was wrong. So wrong. This thing is the best halal food I've ever had. Ever. I wanted to try chicken and rice but wanted some falafel too. Freddie just goes ""okay I put two in there. It usually comes with one but I gave you two."" That's all it took. Yep. Food stand with vendy award get's five star service with a single extra falafel served with a smile. The chicken was amazing. It was the game changer for the chicken and rice with white sauce that you can't get anywhere else in the five boroughs. So tender... so... good... The falafel? I've had many highly rated falafels before. This is simply the best falafel I've ever had. I mean... what else do you want to know? This is the best. Number one. I'm right and anyone else who says otherwise is wrong. It has a slightly longer, more oblong-y shape compared to the spherical falafel elsewhere. Does it matter? No. I don't care if its shaped like a... you know... I'd still eat it with utmost pleasure. The platter was huge. I think It'll take me 3 meals to finish. I kind of regret getting a platter now.

3828,10,5,5/21/2012,Amazing food. Â It seems they use quality ingredients. Â Each ingredient can be appreciated independently and its good enough to not need sauce.

No problem, just an error on my part. Upon arrival if you watched the Vendy stuff you expect a very warm staff, and a multitude of sauces on your food. ALONG with the different toppings and a unique taste. HOWEVER what you really get is a rather overpriced same quality meat as any of Halal cart. The one plus is that the vegetables are different as they give you pickled stuff. I didn't really like the pickled stuff, but I really appreciate it though. The debate of these guys versus the ones on 53rd? Well maybe it was my single bad experience and the fact that it takes me close to two hours to get here, but this place lost in my book. OH RIGHT, our plates didn't even come with that one signature Falafel piece they put on the side. Shake my head.",1

3836,10,5,4/8/2012,"King of Falafel and Shawarma is bit far from where I live, but it was totally worth the trip to sample it. Â I ordered chicken and shawarma platter with yellow rice. Â The difference between Kofas and the 56thSt/6Ave place is that Kofas makes chicken right at the cart, and pickles were added to accentuate the already nice flavor. Â I also added 4 falafels as a side, they were a bit over fried, nonetheless delicious. I wish Kofas is a lot closer to my neighborhood so I can have it every other day.",1
3837,10,4,4/6/2012,"I always get a chicken over rice from a vendor nearby my apartment in Manhattan. I have to say the one from King of Falafel and Shawarma is much better than that. Its taste, volume and price are so worth it.",1
3838,10,3,3/29/2012,"What you need to know about this cart is that when you order falafel you are getting something fresh. Not something that was fried 30minutes to an hour ago and being reheated. This is some fresh falafel. Crispy on the outside, and moist inside. Ton's of flavor and spices. I imagine their special falafel blend has 20 Â  or so ingredients but I don't know - I assume its top secret. The best thing is being treated to a nice hot freshly fried falafel while waiting on line. Like that sensation of sneaking something from the kitchen before dinner is served. If you like halal carts and falafel its definitely worth a try, maybe even a short train ride. If you live in Astoria and haven't had this, you're absolutely nuts.",1

The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it hit a little hard, but then again that could have just been my own doing. I ate the whole thing in less than 20 minutes.",1
3840,10,4,3/27/2012,"Pretty close to five starts. Â Their chicken is good, and the lamb is also good quality. Â The rice does leave a little to be desired. Â That being said, the second best halal cart I have been to (NW corner of 46th and 6th is the best).",1
3841,10,4,3/25/2012,"This cart is at the end of my block, so at least once a week I succumb to spicy aroma on my way home from work. Â And it tastes as good as it smells. Â I almost always order the chicken plate (6$), which is enough for two meals. Â  The falafel is delicious, and worth a stop even if you aren't hungry for a meal.",1
3842,10,5,3/21/2012,"I don't usually review on yelp, but the King of Falafel and Shawarma cart is THE BEST CART EVER. The guys who work there are super friendly and often offer a free falafel while you wait. Chicken and rice is to die for. Beef kebab is also a must have. Try their shawarma on a pita... TRY EVERYTHING... its absolutely delicious",1
3843,10,5,3/19/2012,"Crack-falafels. That's what they should be named. Hands down, the BEST falafel I've ever had and I frequent a lot of halal carts / shawarma shops. Especially when you're waiting on line and he treats you to a freshly cooked one. Amazing. Freddy is an awesome guy, Freddy jr is an awesome plate (the plate I always order), You can't go wrong. My only quip: They don't have nighttime hours. Once the dinner rush is over, that's it. Do you know how hard it is to get out there by 9 PM?????",1
3844,10,5,3/17/2012,Their chicken on rice is like crack. Â I smell it when I get off the subway and I want it. Â I have a hard time walking by the stand without wanting it. Â It's pretty much a weekly indulgence for me.,1
3845,10,5,3/13/2012,"No doubt, he's da king of falafel. Dude I love thier falafel so much I just make up execuse to hit Broadway. Sure the platters are also awesome, but I go there for falafel.",1
3846,10,2,3/3/2012,"The falafel is great-- every bite is perfectly crispy, but the rest of the sandwhich (wrap, lettuce, etc) is totally plain. Â Hot sauce is a good touch though!",1
3847,10,4,2/22/2012,"One of the best Shawarma Places in NYC. Â  You have different choices for rice options, the lamb and chicken are fresh and not over cooked ! To top it off they serve falafal with every plate and you can order more on the side. The falafal is way better than my moms! The only problem he closes early around 9pm and he is not there on Sundays !",1
3848,10,5,2/20/2012,"Been dropping by here for a year or two and it's probably the place I've eaten the most besides from my mother's kitchen. When you order, you can expect to wait awhile sometimes so be prepared if it's 25 degrees out as I've had to wait upwards of 15 minutes on the odd occasion(yes, it was in 25 degrees once!). The truck is always blasting some Middle Eastern music and the King himself is often having a lively discussion with some regulars while giving free falafels (fried chickpeas) to those waiting in line. I've had a few quick conversations with him and one of his guys(btw, they all wear PJ bottoms rather often) and they're quite the pleasant bunch. My go-to item is the falafel gyro but I've had the chicken and falafel platters as well. The platters are large portions and can be more than enough for dinner no matter your appetite. Always ask for extra sauce, both white and spicy. The falafel gyro was a heaven sent when I was a veggie as it feels like meat, the pickles are amazing and the falafel crunchy. The platters are all good, and cheap. If every halal truck in Manhattan was as good as these guys, NYC would be THE supreme foodie destination. Seriously.",1
3849,10,5,2/14/2012,"This is the BEST Halal Cart EVERY.....!!! I have had the Freddy Junior and the Gyro & Chicken Platter...It had so much flavor and robust taste... The salad that comes with it is amazing...Pickled turnips, jalapeno,onion, lettuce and tomatoes yum..The brown rice is the original jump off but they offer yellow as well. Every plate comes with a free falafel, plus they give you a free falafel while your waiting...The white sauce is to die for and there homemade hot sauce is unbelievable. I always get extra of both...At lunch time there may be a line but it's worth the wait. For those of you who drive can park in the Ctown parking lot. Enjoy I know I did. P.S. This dish goes great with a beer.",1
3850,10,5,2/11/2012,"Yes, the chicken platter is great, but freddy's jr. (chicken + kefta) is out of this world delicious. $7 for an enormous plate of food. Get it with mixed rice and DO NOT SKIP THE SALAD. The pickled turnips are the bomb. Make sure you get the white and hot sauce too. Also, every platter comes with a free falafel ball, and if you're lucky, you'll get an extra falafel to munch on while you wait. Awesome.",1
3851,10,5,2/11/2012,I don't think I need to repeat what everyone else has already said in their reviews. This place has perfected their marinade. I got the chicken platter w/ basmati rice. It was loaded with succulent meat. I didn't find one bad (chewy piece). So good! AND so cheap! $6 for an overfilling meal. I'm glad I finally tried this place.,1
3852,10,4,1/30/2012,"Good stuff but expect to wait in line. Compared to other halal carts, including the one on 53rd St, King's food seems to be less salty and greasy, which, for me, is a good thing. Portions are generous and you (ok, I) can live off their $6 chicken platter for 2 days. Falafel is just right: good size oblong balls that are soft inside and crunchy on the outside. A side order of 4 is $2. My only complaint is about lettuce, more often than not it looks pretty old. Not that I'm expecting fresh greens from a food truck, I just always get grossed out by beat up lettuce. I wish they'd just leave it out, so that I don't have to fish it out of my platter. At the same time, I can't say no to King's salad entirely because pickled turnips are too good to take a pass on.",1
3853,10,5,1/23/2012,"These guys are the Kings of my foodie heart. Seriously, the best halal cart in the entire city - i can say that, because i've tried like 20 of them. The Kinds finally got their hard-earned Vendy award a few years back - and it is well deserved. I always get the chicken pita wrap with extra veggies, extra white sauce. The chicken is savorly seasoned and perfectly balanced. Also, a shout out must go to their tasty shawarma (lamb, goat, chicken, turkey, beef) on the spit, spinning around for all to enjoy. I have lived directly across the street from these culinary geniuses, and come to rely on their delicious cooking to hit my nostrils as soon as I get off the subway. They are practically perfect - and some of the nicest, funniest guys you could ask to be served by. One of Astoria's foodie secrets - as the guys would say, YAHHHH BABY!",1
3854,10,5,1/20/2012,"The smells that emanate from this cart are irresistible, which you'd think is a good thing, but it isn't when the cart is between your subway stop and your apartment. I usually opt for their chicken and rice with kabob platter, and I have yet to eat more than half in one sitting. Their serving sizes are huge! Their grilled chicken is tender, as is the kabob. Their basmati rice is a little oilier than their yellow rice, but both are very flavorful. Their platters come with a fresh salad, and yes, as some people have mentioned, their pickled onions are a delicious counterpoint to the richness of the meats. They also make the crispiest, tastiest falafel I've ever had. Hands down, this is my favorite of the street meat, and that includes anything I've had in Midtown. Thank goodness I live in a fourth floor walkup; it makes it easier to justify satisfying my falafel and kabob cravings here on a semi-regular basis.",1
3855,10,5,1/15/2012,"This place was worth every second to millisecond of my time. I can't put it in any simpler terms! Food is DELICIOUS and reasonably priced plus it's easily accessible by many transportation mediums. Must try to experience it, give your taste buds a treat!!",1
3856,10,4,1/14/2012,"What can I say that hasn't been already said about this award winning Halal cart situated right off of the busy Broadway/31st Street junction. Â Not much it seems, but I will anyway... People are always asking for comparisons to the now commercial 53rd & 6th Halal Guys in the city. Â As previously mentioned the big difference is in the spices the meat itself is cooked with Â as opposed to the latter cart's flavor coming mainly from their infamous hot sauce. Â Also, they throw in a sample of their staple falafel ball along with pickled radishes to give your taste buds a nice contrast. My usual order is the Junior combo with bismati rice for 7 measly bucks. Â An added bonus with this cart is being located right outside of a grocery store parking lot which makes it easy for those that drive, something not normally found when dealing with street meat. Â Just come with cash and an insatiable appetite and you're good ! Saha wa hana !!",1
3857,10,5,1/13/2012,"Definitely addictive. I've actually never managed to have their shawarma but the Freddy's Junior is outstanding, and enough for two people. Also, the free falafel while you wait in line is nice. Highly recommended!",1
3858,10,5,1/11/2012,"The best halal cart in all of New York City. The chicken and the rice are both exquisitely seasoned, they throw in a couple free falafels in your chicken and rice order, and the overall quality is great. The white sauce here tastes less like mayo and has more of a earthy taste to it. My only gripe would be that the hot sauce here is not as hot as some other places.",1
3859,10,4,1/6/2012,"Awesome halal food. Large portions, good quality food, and Â great service (with the occasional free falafel ball). What more could I ask for. One of the best halal carts around and vendy winners a couple years back. The trophy is the tip jar, gotta love it!",1
3860,10,5,1/2/2012,"Hail to the King, baby. Come to think of it, they should force customers to say that before serving them. Even ignoring the value by city standards at the humble King of Falafel and Shawarma food cart, the selections are delicious enough that they could easily get away with it. Try the chicken platter ($6) with ""white"" sauce and hot sauce, served with salad, saffron rice and a piece of falafel for a cross-section of the smells and tastes available here. This is pretty much as aromatic and savory as it gets in a convenient street-side package. The only downside to a steady diet of this that I can see is the resulting weight gain and sloth although that can partially be countered by the walk to wherever one is actually going to eat - the nearby Socrates Sculpture Park is a fine choice if weather permits and one is in no rush and has nowhere else to go. Don't come here if you're in a hurry during the lunch rush. Don't come here if you're not bearing cash. Don't come here if you're not hungry. Otherwise, why are you still reading this and not on your way?",1
3861,10,4,12/26/2011,"I am intensely mayo-phobic, so I refuse to eat anything that looks like there is even the slightest chance that it might have mayonnaise in it. Since most Yelpers seem to drench their food in white sauce, I needed to check out King of Falafel and Shawarma myself to see whether the chicken and rice plate would still taste good on its own.* It does. The chicken is nicely seasoned and gloriously free of any gross fat, the pickles add a refreshing touch, and the little falafel on the side has great texture. I love spicy food, so the hot sauce added the perfect amount of tangy heat. My one complaint might be the rice, which seemed a tiny bit under-seasoned to me. But at $6 a plate, who can complain? This is perfect, hearty, comfort food for a cold winter day. I'll definitely be back. *Disclaimer: I do know that, technically speaking, ""white sauce"" for falafel or shawarma should just be some combination of yogurt, tahini, lemon juice, garlic, and/or seasonings. But that sauce is white, I'm paranoid, and unless I can independently confirm there is no mayonnaise in it I'm not going to eat it. It's a phobia, alright? It's not supposed to be logical.",1
3862,10,5,12/14/2011,"Bomb Diggity!!!! I've been a fan for years, and I'm so glad they finally got the press that they deserve. But now I have to wait longer for my chicken platter, but it's damn worth it. By a million miles, this is the best mobile vendor in NYC period.",1
3863,10,5,12/12/2011,"While the Halal fanboys/fangirls of Manhattan flock to 53rd & 6th aka the Halal Guys (yelp.com/biz/53rd-and-6tâ€¦), there are only two Halal carts in my mind that are worthy of such street cravings: Sammy's (yelp.com/biz/sammys-halaâ€¦) and this amazing cart, King of Falafel and Shawarma. The endless debate of who tops who is like Pizza in Brooklyn: everyone has a favorite. To suggest KOFAS is better than Sammy's or is miles ahead of 53rd & 6th is relative, despite their Vendy award wins between them, it's worth considering KOFAS doesn't exactly offer the same variety as the aforementioned ... it offers more. And that's one of the reasons why KOFAS is spendier. Their oddball names of their combo platters all tied to the gate they operate on (yelp.com/biz_photos/MSD-â€¦) are not worth balking at, but certainly worth a taste for any hungry street eating enthusiast. Platters can range from $4-9, depending on the lamb and chicken combo stacking, in addition to their mouth watering falafel, which deserve their own highlight for being more unique than the average cart. The falafel is neither of the medallion variety or golfball sized nuggets one typically gets with these sorts of carts. If anything, the KOFAS version (yelp.com/biz_photos/MSD-â€¦) closely resembles pine cones, a grenade of flavorful deep fried chickpea mash, which goes perfectly with their basmati rice, drizzle of tahini and hot sauces, and whatever protein one chooses. While their delectable chicken is definitely of star quality, it's the falafel for me that steals the show. Whenever I get off at the Broadway stop along the N/Q line, it's hard to ignore the intoxicating aroma of their street side cooking, that I am almost always compelled to check it out. On occasion there are crowds of people here, but nothing like the 3AM lines in Midtown. The KOFAS guys are nice and are usually generous enough to throw in an extra falafel or two with any non-falafel combo platter one orders. Regardless of the order, one is virtually guaranteed a hearty portion and above all, a great meal under $10.",1
3864,10,5,12/7/2011,"Yes, they are actually BETTER than the 53rd carts (4 stars for 53rd, so 5 stars for King). Look, I really enjoy the chicken and rice at 53rd, but you have to admit it, it's only good with the sauces. Otherwise, it's bland. King spices their meats, so while they put some red sauce on it, you really don't need it to enjoy it. Plus they actually have more vegetables and pickled radishes to add variety to your plate. Oh, and a falafel =) They're super nice too. Same as 53rd, $6 for chicken and rice, cash only.",1
3865,10,3,12/4/2011,"I know everyone rants and raves about this place and I am not being a hater at all because I have tried them a few times. And trust me, it is in my neighborhood so I would love to love it for the convenience but I do not. - DID I JUST PAY $6 FOR FALAFELS OVER RICE????? - WHY IS EVERYTHING SO OVERLY VINEGARY???!!!!!!!!!!!! Its just aight people, nothing to go all the way to Astoria from another state though thats kinda extreme.",1
3866,10,4,12/3/2011,"Found this after searching for chicken and rice in the area, great reviews so I gave it a try. Smallish menu, but all the basics you could want from a Middle Eastern truck. Chicken, lamb, schwarma and kefta (like a spiced hamburger). We went with the Freddy's Junior (combo kefta and chicken over rice, hot sauce, white sauce, veggies). It was big enough for two people or two meals and very tasty. As good an any chicken and rice place I've been to. It is a street vendor, so no tables. Prices were very reasonable for the portions you got. I've seen less expensive, but the portions were smaller than this. It was about a 20 minute drive to get there for me, so I would go again if I were in the area or seriously craving this food, but like any of these places it's not something I would go out of my way for.",1
3867,10,2,11/28/2011,I walked by here a few times already but never got a chance to try it until a couple days ago. I had some free time plus I hear they won the VENDY award for 2010 so I had to go check it out myself. I order the fafafel platter and the shawarma pita. I asked for white and hot sauce for both. I knew that the best seller was chicken but I wasn't ready in the moody for chicken especially after Thanksgiving. They have their Vendy award right in front where anyone can take a pic of it so that was cool. The whole things wasn't too bad on my wallet so i was happy. I took the food home to share it with my friend but that was a hugh mistakes. I should have eaten it right away because by the time I got home. It was soggy. I try the shawarma first and the beef/lamb meat was chewy and tough. It really didn't have a strong flavor which was disappointing. I ate the falafel afterward and I like that one alot better. The falafel has a nice flavor to it and it was crunchy. Next time I am going order the falafel pita for there and judge it again. Right now I would only give it a 2.5 because the food wasn't bad but it wasn't really outstanding. There are tons of Middle Eastern restaurant in Astoria and you can get things alot cheaper and taste alot better. My opinion only,1
3868,10,5,11/25/2011,"It's been awhile since this cart won their Vendy awards for both the people's choice and the Vendy Cup for best Â food truck. Â In fact they won it in 2010. Â So it's been a long time since I've started drooling reading my friends reviews of this place and hearing it mentioned time again and again in the food blogs. Â A little more than a year since I first heard of this place, I finally made the trek to Astoria from Brooklyn in the freezing rain. The first thing I've discovered about this place is that for a cart, they have a phone number.... and that they actually answer it. Â My question to them? Â What time do they close? Â I'm sure some of you reading this might have wondered the same thing since Yelp doesn't provide this info. Â Not sure about the weekends but on weekdays, they close at 8:30PM. Â You're welcome. Arriving at the location of their cart, I discovered that they are situated right outside a supermarket with a parking lot. Â In fact, they are right besides the parking lot. Â Customer parking only the signage reads. Â Errr.... yep, I'm a customer alright. Maybe not today but probably another day. *wink* The guys manning this cart (Yep, I said guys. Â It seems to take three to run this thing even so far from the main part of the city) were really friendly and once they heard that we took a trip from Brooklyn just to get to them, they gave each of us an extra falafel to sample on top of the one that already comes with our platter. Hot off the fryer, without even a drop of sauce on it, this falafel is still among the best if not the best falafel I've tasted anywhere. Â Super crispy, crunchy texture on the outside with a nice contrasting moist softer interior in the inside, I would have happily ordered another Â batch of just these the next time I'm here. As for the main event, the vendy award winning platter, we took it to our dry interior of the car in the parking lot and enjoyed it with the pitty patter of rain drops sounding all around us. Â Ah.. the joy of free parking. Given a choice of yellow rice and basmati rice, I told the guy manning the cart to chose the one he prefer and he chose the basmati rice for me. Â  So folks, you now know what they themselves would eat their platter with. Â Sadly, despite their name of King of Falafel and SHAWARMA, they ran out of shawarma to order so instead, I had the chicken instead which I was told was the better seller anyway. One bite and..... 53rd and 6th Halal Guys who? Â I mean I actually like the Halal Guys, but they taste very similar to some of the other carts in town, if only slightly better. Â But the King of Falafel and Shawarma, they have a flavor of their own. Â The chicken was nicely spiced and moist and was the rice. Â No dry overcooked stuff here. Â Even the Halal guys fail in this regard sometimes when they get too hectic. Â The white sauce and hot sauce (if you choose to put either one on the food that is), really bring extra flavor to what is already great tasting food, and it's helped by a mix of raw onions, green peppers, lettuce and what I assumed to be a pickled turnips to give it contrasting flavors and textures to each bite. Â I especially love the pickled turnips (?). So yes folks, I do believe they deserve their win. Â And yes, I believe they are worth the trek even from all the way from Brooklyn. Â All hail the King in Queens.. **************************************************Â­************************************** P.S. Â Just a warning.

3870,10,4,11/16/2011,"When both my Astoria neighbors Elle P. and Evan R. sing praises to the King of Falafel and Shawarma, I knew I should probably give it a try. Â Although I've passed by a thousand times, I've never thought of trying it out as most of those times, I knew I can't wear the King's fragrance to where I was going. You see, although theoretically, a kitchen truck does not need an exhaust fan, the people buying its food literally act as the exhaust, carrying the scent of the food with them after such rendezvous, perhaps as a badge of honor. The ideal time finally came and as I waited to place my order, a falafel appetizer was offered to me. :) It was spicy, hot off the grill and tasty. Â It occurred to me then that a lot of restaurants can learn customer service and even charm itself from the King's men serving food from a truck. Â When the mountain of chicken, rice and salad were ready, I was a bit surprised to know that it only costs $6. Â And the King's knight even said it with a smile and looked grieved that I had to skip sitting at the van, which experience Evan R., richly described. Thanks to Elle P. and Evan R., also Rich and Derrick for clueing me to this spot. Â You were all in my thoughts as I gently wolfed down the food that had a generous dollop of yogurt and spicy sauce.

But I have to say that The King of Falafel and Shawarma is just AWESOME. It is outstanding with great flavors in their Shawarma and chix platters. Before I had my first meal I would drive by and see 5 to 10 people always waiting on line rain or shine. Good sign. Then after almost a year in my new neighborhood of Astoria I decided to stop by. Frist I stood at a distances and observed for about an hour. They met my high standards of sanitation. Always wore gloves and the biggie, they changed them after touching raw chicken. No cross contamination. Excellent job. They kept their backup supplies in a van with all products properly stored with ice on items that needed to be kept cold. They took great care in running a safe and clean cart. Great job guys, I commend you. The food is the Best. Tender juicy meats with great sauces and large portions. Always hot. Always good. They have me as a loyal customer when there was a line of 10 plus people and the guy offered everyone a free Falafel. WOW. Great customer service and retention marketing. I could see why they were runner up in 2009 and winners in 2010 for The Vendy Award. Great job guys for great food in a safe and clean cart.",1

Â I pretty much only get the shwarma with basmatti rice now....once in a while I'll get the yellow rice, but only when I request basmatti and they're so busy they give me yellow rice by mistake. Â This probably happens once every 6 months or so. Â Sometimes the shwarma can be dry if they over cook it, but the ""hot sa white sa"" (hot sauce white sauce) make up for the aridity.

They pack a circular foil container with rice, tons of chicken, one piece of falafel, some veggies, and your obligatory white and hot sauces. The chicken was really tender and flavorful. The rice was good, but nothing that blew my mind. The vegetables, which consisted of lettuce, tomato, and some kind of pickled purple things (a strong, almost horseradish-y flavor), were a fine complement. The sauces were just as you want them - hot being all fiery and sinus-clearing, and white being all jizzy and soothing. I wish I lived closer to this cart so I could eat at it more often.

We took a pretty circuitous route from my house to the Museum of the Moving Image with plans to get cheap lunch on the way. My two friends are foodies on a budget, and I wanted to get them something that wouldn't break the bank but would give them a real taste of New York when I realized we were by Broadway- since there is no shawarma cart in rural Vermont I thought the King would be a great treat and I was right. We all had shawarma on pita sandwiches, well loved by all. We were even given complimentary falafel while we waited! The gentlemen working the cart were incredibly friendly and I felt really good about giving them my business. Here's to the least creepy street food in the city!",1

3881,10,5,9/7/2011,"Easily the best cart food I've had in the city. You can get basmati rice (which is definitely the right choice). Both the shawarma and the chicken are flavorful and delicious. The salad is not the mere dry lettuce and tomato that so many other carts give you, it actually has some flavor of its own. As an added bonus, you get a free falafel ball while you wait.",1
3882,10,5,9/4/2011,"oh, the king, how i love thee. my boyfriend convinced me to try it....i was hesitant about eating from a food truck. but they have a sink in the cart. the chicken and rice is addicting. if you are ever by the broadway subway station in astoria and hungry, go here. u will NOT regret it. and will prob be telling everyone about it ;)",1
3883,10,5,9/1/2011,"The well deserved ""Winner of Vendy Awards""......ahead of 53rd and 6th!!! Its a pity, this cart is in a somewhat quiet neighbourhood in Astoria, and not somewhere in Midtown!! I love street food.... and this was the best i ever had....much more tastier than others, and better than 53rd and 6th....I am just surprised I dint find this place earlier. Juiciest chicken over rice platter, great salad, huge portions, good sauce, free falafel while standing in the line, more bang for your buck= Repeat customers!!",1
2549,10,2,9/1/2011,"I mean no disrespect but I'm not getting what the other yelpers tasted. My friend bought over two orders of the chicken and shawarma (or maybe the kefta?) platter - one with basmati rice and another with yellow rice. Yes, the meat pieces are a lot bigger and juicer compared to let's say, 53rd and 6th halal cart and Mamoun's Falafel but sorry to say, I found the spices to be too much. The spices tasted more like a coating instead of a marinade in the meat. Despite my love for discovering new things, my taste buds might have gotten accustomed to the other well known halal places. Here's what I've noticed: Rice - too moist Sauces - white tahini sauce was bland and the hot sauce didn't bring out much heat. I'm a sauce girl. Pita - dry and sandy Falalel - one generous piece but nothing compared to Taim's even though it could be two different styles. Salad - lettuce, tomato, onions and purple turnip pickles. I can live without the pickles. So, everything mixed together resulted in a disappointing aftermath in my mouth. The only thing I commend them is the amount of food they give you for the price. Just want you to know, I'm not talking crap about King of Falalel... I just prefer my halal food from somewhere else.",1
3884,10,5,8/27/2011,"I am loyal customer since they were new on the block. Try their Shawrma and Kefta. Falafel is one of a kind. It's not like most Halal carts that make more of an Egyptian style. But their's is more Palestinian or Lebanese style, crunchy on the outside, moist in the inside. Also, try their Basmati rice, gives a real good middle eastern flavor.",1
3885,10,4,8/25/2011,"We had the Kefta and rice platter and the Chicken and shawarma combo, with white sauce and salad.....Wow...tastes amazing. All I have to say is these guys serve better food than most of the restaurants I go to. 7 Bucks gets you nice heaping platter of meat and salad and some Falafel. Â You don't need anything else, its a very satisfying meal! I highly recommend this middle eastern food cart!!",1
3886,10,5,8/24/2011,"I'm no stranger to cart food, but I was wondering how the shawarma here could be so much better than average. Now I wonder how it's possible to eat twice your body weight without dying. The chicken platter came in a container piled high with tons of chicken, white sauce, lettuce, tomato, yellow rice and even some un-ordered falafel. It was $6. I sat in one of the plastic chairs in the parking lot and shoveled chicken in my face behind an unmarked van. I felt like a chicken pedophile. I tried to leave some leftovers for tomorrow. I just got home and ended up inhaling the rest while listening to rhythmic music and angry-sounding Arabic chants on their website. This was the juiciest, most flavorful shawarma I think I've ever had. Long live the king.",1
3887,10,5,8/23/2011,"Now, having just come from New Haven, CT, I can honestly say that I'm a huge fan of cart food. Â New Haven has some of the best cart food stands EVAR. Â We are talkin' boom boom pow kachow good cart food. Â Enter King of Falafel and Shawarma in Queens. Â Mang, this food is good. Â My cous, Sean W, knows his stuff. Â Based on my trust in his reviewing prowess, I decided to check out this cart one day on the way home from work. Â OH MY GOODNESS WAS IT GOOD. Â IT WAS SO INCREDIBLY GOOD. Â LIKE IT WAS REALLY GOOD? Â DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? Â THERE WAS JUST AN INTENSE LEVEL OF FLAVOR THAT SEARED A MEMORY INTO MY MIND THAT CANNOT BE DESTROYED. I got the standard chicken and rice dish. Â It was delicious. Â The chicken was tasty, the rice had a little bit of oil in it, but not too much. Â The oil and the spices were totally soaked into the rice giving the rice a rich and deep flavor mmmm oh man oh man. Â Just oh man. Â Wow. Â Like these guys deserve to win food awards for being awesome. Â Didn't they win a vendy or something? Â Cuhrazy. Â I seriously got home and just completely destroyed this thing. Â Just destroyed it. Â I opened the container and it was gone. Â It was like a bunch of 5th graders did a stop-motion movie of me eating and lost all the frames in between opening the food and me passed out on my living room couch. Â Just wow. Â  Ever since I ate their food I've got this like slow-motion time lapse memory effect where the dude at the cart is like, ""siixxxx dollllluuurrrssssss pppuhhhleeeeeeeaaaassssseeeeee thhhhhannnkkuuuhhhhyooouuuuuuuuu"" and I'm like slomo (not shlomo) walking down Broadway past the Bel-Aire diner like, ""oh maybe I should stop here and oh wait there's food in my hand"". Â I think I almost ate the container by accident when I started Pac Man chomping on the remainder of the food that was in there. Â  CHECK THIS CART OUT IF YOU HAVEN'T OH YEAH BABY OH YEAH.",1
3888,10,5,8/20/2011,"Their falafel lives up to the huge hype. I tried it a couple of months ago and every time I have a chance I make my way to Astoria to get a falafel sandwhich. Just thinking about those crispy balls of garbanzo, the pickled veggies and hot sauce makes me want to go out and get some right now. You really can't beat that much deliciousness at that price ($3! I dare anyone to find a satisfying, and tasty meal for that price). As for their chicken, I can't really say much because I don't eat meat but damn it does smell good",1
3889,10,4,8/12/2011,"The chicken and rice was just ok. Â The chicken was dry. Â I like the Halal chicken and rice better in Midtown on 6th Ave and 50 something st. Â  Although, I thought the falafel pita was pretty tasty. Â Better than Mamoun in the East Village.",1
3890,10,5,8/5/2011,"Chicken & rice at 30th & Broadway (Astoria) VERSUS Chicken & rice at 53rd & 6th (Manhattan): both are $6 Astoria: Hand chopped chicken & onion, basmati or yellow rice, iceberg lettace, pickled turnip, tomatoes, onions, 1 falafel. Manhattan: Hand chopped chicken, yellow rice, iceberg lettace, pita. Astoria cart wins in taste and value. The chicken is perfectly seasoned, moist, and fresh. The rice is fluffy, the veggies are fresh, and the falafel is a generous oblong stick instead of the usual ball. If you have to wait for the food to finish cooking, they'll give you a free sample-- we each got a falafel stick while we waited on line. The red sauce is very tasty, but is mild compared to the red sauce used in Manhattan. The portions are more generous in Astoria. Manhattan cart used to be my favorite, but that was before I tried the Astoria cart. Why? The meat is heavily salted-- the lamb is much saltier than the chicken. They rely on the meat to give the rice flavor. They're more generous with the iceberg lettace, but slightly less generous with the meat. The red sauce is extremely spicy, but doesn't have any flavor other than heat. Also, they're falafel balls were cold and dry-- absolutely gross.",1
3891,10,5,8/3/2011,No wonder they are the King and winner of the Vendy cup! Freddie lured us in by giving us samples of his wonderful falafel and these were the best falafel I've ever tasted! The oblong shape made it easier to eat. I think the shape may also help even distribution of heat by increasing the surface area and making the entire falafel have a more uniformed taste. The falafel was packed with flavor and freshness you can't just stop after sampling one!! The kefta pita was also superb! I see myself visiting this cart again and again. Yummmmm!!,1
3892,10,4,7/23/2011,"They currently have the Vendy award sitting right in front of the cart. They definitely deserve it! I ordered the chicken over rice. Only chicken no salad please. I never enjoy the salads as they have been sitting there for a while. The chicken was very juicy and tender! It came with a falafel Â which was crispy and delicious! I will order the falafel sandwich next time (it is one of the more popular items). The rice was a plump fluffy rice. It was good but my personal preference is for the rice to be thin and chewy, Everything went well together. The hot sauce is not too hot and the white sauce is always great since it helps add a little more flavor. I don't know how these guys can handle cooking in the hot weather. But props to them! One of the best chicken over rice halal carts I've ever tried.",1
3893,10,5,7/13/2011,"This cart is right by my apartment and the smell coming home from work everyday is an immediate treat. I can't eat it all the time, but it is so good. The price is unbelievable for the amount of food that you get and the guys working the cart are all so nice. It's part of the experience chatting with them while waiting for your food. I had a friend make the trip from the Bronx just to try it and he said it was well worth the trip. I can't say enough good things about them. They totally deserved the Vendy.",1
3894,10,4,7/7/2011,"First let me start by saying, I don't normally eat ""street meat"" or food from carts like this one. But these guys are so close to my apt that we just HAD to try it. Been going to them for a year now...! I'm usually grossed out by street carts because I often wonder where they wash their hands?? Â Well these guys have a built in sink! YAY! if you are a newbie standing in line, they will give u a falafel to eat while you wait! I have never had such good falafel like this! Â A falafel wrap (on pita) costs $3 and it comes stuffed with falafel, pickled veggies, lettuce, tomato, onion, tahini sauce and a spicy red sauce. Amazing. Â The chicken and basmati rice is delicious as well and the portion is huge!! It smells so good sometimes that it grabs u by the nostrils! These guys won the Vendy award last year and they def deserve it! They put it out there on display every day. Also, these guys are awesome...they are out there in the summer heat as well as the snow in winter. We always tip them because their food is awesome and they're pretty nice guys as long as you dont piss them off! I hope they never leave the corner of Broadway & 30th!!",1
3895,10,5,7/6/2011,"No matter how good or bad the food is, it always tastes better if the person serving the food is nice and polite. There is no exaggeration people hail him as the king. I went here after they won the vendy award for 2010. King treats every customer as regular, talks and even give some food samples while waiting for the food. I requested for both yellow/basmati rice for the combo platter and I loved the food. Thankfully this place is far for me else I would easily put on lot of pounds.",1
3896,10,5,7/6/2011,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this place? It's the best cart food you'll have in NYC. Falafel wrap for lunch, and chicken platter for dinner, and with all that you're still only spending $10. You gotta have cart!",1
3897,10,5,7/6/2011,"I'm new to the neighborhood and have walked past ""King"" coming from the metro station. The smell, look and the crowd made this a must-try. I've eaten twice Â so far and each time absolutely delicious. This will become a habit......",1

3899,10,5,6/27/2011,"So after eating at this place a dozen times, I'm finally writing my review of this place. Â I've eaten at several of these halal food carts including the well known ones like the one on 52nd St. and 6th Ave where all the drunks flock to at 3 am in the morning(yeah I've been one of them). Â  I've always gotten the chicken with rice platter here which comes with choice of rice (yellow or basmati), halal chicken, salad, pickled turnips, and 1 falafel. Â Everything on the plate is pretty damn delicious including the white and hot sauce they use. Â I prefer this joint over any of the other ones I've had in Manhattan and Queens not because it's in my neighborhood, but for the simple fact that it's just flat out tastier and better made. Â  For the quality and amount of food you get, I can't think of a place that gets you more bang for your buck.",1
3324,10,5,6/15/2011,"4.5 stars... The King of Falafel won a Vendy award in 2010 for best street food in NYC, they proudly display their trophy on a pedestal by their cart on Broadway and 30th street (a block from the Broadway N/Q in Astoria). I guess the lines for this cart can get pretty long but I only had to wait for 4 people and it moved quick on a weeknight. Typically they have one guy taking the orders/payment and another guy dishing out the food. The guy taking my order was very nice and personable, one of the things I'm sure contributed to his success. I got their chicken platter (seasoned chopped chicken on rice with salad and choice of white and/or hot sauces) which they also give you a piece of falafel (which is actually pretty large and oblong verses the typical ball you get most places). The chicken was higher quality than I've ever gotten from a food cart and was seasoned and cooked perfectly, the falafel was also awesome and flavorful without being oily at all. The prices here aren't the cheapest I've seen from street carts but they're still a great value, especially considering the quality and quantity of food. Â I got the white sauce which was ok but when (not if) I go back I think I'd go without the sauce because the chicken is so flavorful and juicy it doesn't need anything. I wish I could just skip the salad and rice fillers and get a platter full of the chicken and falafel, they were awesome. The only problem is that there isn't a park or benches in the area so finding a spot to eat if you don't live in the area or want to stand is a little problematic.",1
3900,10,1,6/6/2011,"I had a falafel sandwich from here that tasted like feces, literally. Not sure how that happens (how can you go wrong with fried chickpeas/spices?) I also don't like the mess they leave behind on the sidewalk everyday. Yuck.",1
3901,10,5,5/25/2011,"Alas, King of Falafel and Shawarma sits between my local train stop and my apartment. Â It has been months since I made it from the former to the latter with five bucks in my pocket. Â Inevitably, whether I have just eaten or not, I buy myself a chicken wrap. Â  It is just so good and so cheap and so convenient and so wonderful that I can't resist. Â Thankfully, I usually leave for work before it opens and return home after it closes, or I would be a much wider man.",1
3902,10,5,5/23/2011,"BEST halal good I have ever tasted. 53rd and 6th or Halal guys got NOTHING on these guys. Get the combo which comes with marinated chicken, shish kabob meat, rice of choice, lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, pickled radish, a falafel and choice of white, hot and BBQ sauce.",1
3903,10,2,5/21/2011,"Queens....There's so many reasons why we're on the map. But the main reason has got to be the authentic food. We're lucky to have enough 1st generation immigrants to ensure the dishes stay authentic and fairly inexpensive! However, I think the latter is giving way... *please read my previous review now since this is an update* Prices are up from my last visit: 1) falafel platter = $6 2) chicken platter = $6 - $7 (can't remember for sure, but i think it was the latter) 3) kefta or shawarma platter = $7 - $8 (can't remember for sure, but i think it was the latter) In general, i think the food is decent with good spices and flavor. It's just that the chicken and shawarma have been dry (even with all the sauces). Today i ordered a falafel platter to be safe and that was dry as well. I don't really know what's going on with the cart, but it's not as good as it once was.... Random thoughts: 1) the platter isn't that big: it just seems big because it's overflowing when you try to eat out of it. It's actually the same size as the petite Styrofoam takeout boxes the other carts use. 2) the pickled vegetables are OK: but it kinda loses its novelty quick. Summary: I'm going to have to drop the rating down to 2 stars because ironically the quality is down and prices are up. I would have recommended the kefta platter because last time it was pretty good. But at a cost of $8 for a fairly small container!?!? I don't understand how a Queens cart can charge higher prices than carts in the city....",1

Â I think I have to rescind the ""best falafel ever"" comment i gave to a previous establishment, because this is simply better. Â Although it was a bit greasy, I was excellently seasoned and perfectly crispy. Â I like the oblong shape, a bit different than the usual falafel. Â The owner is very friendly and entertaining which is nice, since there is usually a few minutes wait. Â Last time i was here they gave everyone on the line a free falafel for waiting, a nice gesture. Â The food is expectedly cheap and SUPER filling. Â I think i was full for the rest of the day.

This cart is by far - like its namesake - the King. And the king is at its prime... and has been for a while. Â The service is always friendly (service? at a cart??) and you never walk away without a ""sample"" of their crisp yet moist falafel.

As a special treat for her visit, the King gave the Princess a special little gift of a crispy, crunchy falafel that she greatly enjoyed and later wished that she ordered a falafel plate because the falafel was pretty fricking great. The chicken was very tender and flavorful. The pickled vegetables in the salad gave a nice vinegary bite that was need to cut the heaviness of the chicken and rice. Very very generous portions as there was enough food for two meals and the Princess only paid $6. The King really does deserve his Vendy award. Hip, hip, hooray for the King!",1

The flavor alone on the chicken and rice is enough to want to keep going back aside from the fact you could get two meals out of it.

To top it off they are friendly and entertaining. I don't expect anyone to kiss my a$$ when ordering food from them lol, but I've been to other street vendors where I've simply asked ""how are you?"" while waiting and they looked at me like I was a bother.

Â Although the chicken and rice platter is awesome (you get enough food for two with $6), nothing comes close to their falafels. Â More nugget-shaped than an average falafel ball, with a surprising note of spice after every bite, they're easily the best falafels I've had in NYC.

The only thing that stops me from going here every say is my new year's resolution to cook at home more, but we'll see how long that lasts.

3926,10,5,1/16/2011,"Much like a last call pickup, the typical NYC chicken (or lamb) & rice street food experience usually begins in value based excitement, but ends the next day with regretful disappointment and a case of the runs. But Astoria's King of Falafel is like discovering a type of girl you swore not to get involved with is actually pretty decent. I only went about once a year, but that seemed to have been enough time for to forget that every time I got sick. It may have been that the meat is literally simmering in its own fat, poor sanitation or both, but after the last time, I swore them off completely. Then I heard about Falafel King and decided to give him a shot. Glad I did. King of Falafel is head and shoulders above the competition, in every metric. The food is very high quality - well prepared, fresh, tasty; he's definitely paying attention and (unlike the cast majority) genuinely cares about his product. And it shows. It was my first visit, so he gave us each a falafel to try (excellent), and threw on into the chicken, lamb & rice plate I got. The small salad side (usually just iceberg lettuce and chopped tomatoes) had some middle eastern pickles as well. Most of these places try to compensate for substandard food by giving larger portions (as if a larger quantity of garbage will make up for the fact that it's garbage), but falafel king focuses on quality over quantity. A much better move. I'm a big guy, and can eat a mountain, but I hate to waste food. His plate was just the right size. HIGHLY recommended. You won't go wrong with Falafel King.",1
3927,10,5,1/14/2011,"The best, no question. And Freddy and the guys are sweethearts. I ate there last night on a plastic chair in a pile of snow and nearly froze to death. It was worth it. That lamb . . .",1

Definitely my favorite halal guy. He's like the cousin/uncle you look forward to seeing at the family events. Everytime I go, he makes my day. He's sweet and absolutely hilarious.

3933,10,5,11/15/2010,"Been a while since I last logged on to this site, but having just eaten at King of Falafel and Shawarma, I felt the need to make my triumphant return to Yelp. I just moved to Astoria and as I try to find time between work, school, and attempting to unpack my things, I have no time to cook. Â So lately I've been eating almost exclusively food cart grub, which by the way, I love. Â Tonight, as I was walking toward the CTown grocery store, I passed by the King's cart and decided to give it a go. Â I had no idea the accolades that are being heaped upon this tiny food station. Â Apparently they just won a Vendy award (which I had never even heard of) for best food cart chow. Â And after devouring a falafel platter with all the fixins, I have no problem with them being handed the trophy. Â Pretty easily the best halal food I've ever eaten. I'll start with the falafel, which were super crunchy on the outside and pillowy soft on the inside. Â The rice (order the basmati if given the option) is unquestionably the best food cart rice in NYC. Â Not that i've tried it all, but there's just no way any other food cart rice could be better. Â Even the salad was a surprise because it included turnips which I love and don't think i've had since I was like 15. Â And at five dollars for a massive plate of food, both your tummy and your wallet will be very happy after your meeting with The King. If falafel is not your thing, apparently they are really renowned for their chicken and rice platters. Â Didn't have the room in my belly to order both, but the chicken looked and smelled delicious. If you think you can't find royalty in the back of a makeshift food-mobile, this place is guaranteed to prove you wrong. Â Long live The King.",1
3934,10,5,11/15/2010,"Finally made got to try it after a few failed attempts in the past. Â Definitely worth the wait though. Â by far, its the BEST chicken/lamb and rice cart i've had and way better than the Halal Guys cart in midtown. Â I wish it was open 24/7. Â The rice and lamb are way more flavored and the plate combo inlcudes a falafel. Â MONEY. Â Next time I go I'll stock up with a month's supply.",1
3935,10,5,11/11/2010,"Certainly a spiritual experience! The big fluffy, yet crunchy falafel almost melts in your mouth as you chow down on the free samples they hand out on the regular. ""The King"" is certainly a character and his food is as big as his personality and you will not walk away from this humble street cart unsatisfied. The Chicken and Rice is enough to feed a small village and I doubt the price can be beat anywhere. This man has not let the Vendy Award go to his head what so eva.",1

Â Here's the thing: Â It's restaurant-quality food at truck-quality prices. Â The guys are friendly, the line moves, it's cheap and portions are large. Â Also, it was pretty spicy, which I like. That said, it's still food from a truck. Â So ranting about what I couldn't get or whether the award is overrated or whatever doesn't apply here. Â It's a truck. Â You line up, you pay, you eat. Â There's no hostess to complain about, no seating issues or proximity to the bathroom problems. Â It's very good quality falafel that is situated on a curb. And that's the review.

I ordered the chicken with rice, asked if mixed was available I was told no.. No biggy. Â  Â I got a good portion of chicken over basmati rice with a falafel loaded with white sauce. Â  The meat is very flavorful and rightly seasoned.. Seasoned chicken was something that attracted me to 52nd and 6th before they were taken over by 53rd and got replaced with unflavorful chicken... Â The chicken was delicious, and the falafel was tasty.. I had falafels like 3 times, so I'm not going to judge who has the best falafel since they all taste the same to me. Â  Â  What I didn't like was the basmati rice, I wasn't asked what kind a rice I wanted... The rice had a weird taste and it t turned me way the rice.. This is coming from someone who'll eat a whole platter, yellow rice included.

But if they keep making my chicken platter as magical as it is they can make fun of me all they want. I just wish that they had a twitter stream (or something) hooked up to their site (like the schnitzel truck) that tells you when theyre working.

""Yellow"" (crap, I wanted Basmati) Hot sauce? ""Nope"" You sure? ""Oh, I'm sure"" (unless you want to see me breathe fire). $8 (hellz yeah!).

How could such incredible quality food come from a street vendor?? I've been eating from here for over 2 years and NEVER had a bad dish. No matter what time of day you come, the food is always FRESH and ready to serve. They use the best ingredients and have perfected the falafel and chicken. That chicken? If I could learn how to make it as good then I'd be a happy girl. Even the veggies are a nice touch especially when you get the hot sauce. It helps you cool down.

This food has enough flavor that you could do without white sauce, but that would be ridiculous, I could never pass up on that white sauce. What is that stuff? MAYO with sour cream? With yogurt? salads good too, diff then just the usual plain salad others give. Anyways, this halal is really deelish. I've yet to try Sammy's, but so far this is my fave.",1

3946,10,5,10/7/2010,"Fresh off their 2010 Vendy Award, I decided it was time for a return visit to the best food cart in all of New York. With all the fresh, innovative, and original food carts and trucks in the city, why would one that serves falafel be considered the best when there are tons of food carts that sell the same? BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST FALAFEL EVER. I've been to King of Falafel a few times and always order the falafel with yellow rice, salad, both white and hot sauce, and a piece of pita on the side. It's only $5 and it is ridiculously good. They don't cook the falafel into the traditional ball shape but into long oval shapes. I'm not sure what this does, but all I know is that it's tastier and crispier than any falafel I have ever had. Also, mixing jalapenos in with the salad is a spectacular addition. Maybe the best thing about King of Falafel is the immense pride they seem to take in what they cook. It could just be an ordinary falafel neighborhood street cart, but they make sure you get your food quickly and that you are served with the utmost politeness. The purveyor, who is often cooking, is supremely friendly that I'm sure their Vendy Award win is based just as much on their kind service as it is on their fantastic food.",1

That said, I still go when I need something fast, cheap, and not bad quality.",1

3950,10,2,8/26/2010,"I really hate to do this because obviously so many people really like this Cart and the owner but i have never been more disappointed by food after being so excited to try it. I have been addicted to falafel lately and after reading all the outstanding reviews I had to try this cart. I live in Astoria so it was right there off the train and I couldn't pass up the chance to get falafel from the ""King"". I ordered falafel on a pita with everything but hot sauce and got the hot sauce on the side. I also ordered a side order of falafel so i could taste it plain (I'm telling you i have been addicted to falafel). I took the food back to my apartment and prepared to be amazed. I unwrapped the sandwich and this thing looked amazing. Too bad it didn't taste as good as it looked. The owner brags about the shape of his falafel being the reason it's so good. It's not in the shape of a ball like almost all other falafel. It's more of an oblong shape. See people's pictures to know what I mean. I think it was the shape that made the falafel dry on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The taste was pretty bland too. I also didn't like the marinated vegetables. I want fresh/raw lettuce, tomato, and onion. Sorry King...my search for the best falafel in Astoria continues. Screw Flanders",1

There are plenty of other falafel places in the city that have perfected the crunchy on the outside soft and smooth on the inside texture (looking at you Mamoun's) but no one has the extent of flavor that the King packs into his falafel.",1

Did I mention it's affordable? 3 for pita, 4 for hero, 5 for platter. If you're a foodie or falafel fan it's in the least worth a trip to check out. If you live in Astoria, it'll probably become a destination for you. Oh, and they're really nice people. Many say that they love the chicken and rice, I wasn't a big fan when I tried it.

As first timers, we walked up to a bunch of people crowded around the cart haphazardly, while we were looking at their menus which were a bunch of pictures and incorrectly spelled English words hung up on a fence. It's a zoo at this corner because you still have regular foot traffic trying to get by while people are trying to order, read the menus and wait for their cart made goodness to be ready...and you know New Yorkers aren't patient and HATE when people are just standing there on the sidewalk in their way of getting from point A to point B. We ordered the Chicken Kabob platter that came with salad, shredded chicken over Basmati rice, 2 chicken kabobs and 1 piece of falafel, with yogurt sauce and a hint of spicy sauce drizzled about. It was quite good, much better than the original chicken and rice dude in Manhattan midtown on 6th and 54th/55th which I've had several times. The chicken here is tastier, less fattier and heartier along with the rice being more flavorful and the veggies being fresher. It's definitely worth a return trip and for $10 including 2 bottles of water, it's not breaking your bank either! *NOTE* we both had gaseous air bubble pockets under our chest later that day from the spicy cart goodness...it was worth it though.",1

I was even prepared to shoot, stuff, and grill a dirty pigeon myself (don't judge, try the hamaam when you go to Cairo, you won't regret it) when I've tried various restaurants in the Little Egypt strip here in Astoria. Not to be disrespectful to the great chefs there but the cooking has been Americanized a little bit which takes away the authenticity and flavor, sad to say. I took one bite and I was transported back to dusty, polluted Cairo, with its 70 million strong mass of humanity, swirling all around, with the blare of taxis adding to the cacophony of prayer calls. And for $6, it can't be beaten. True, Mr. Freddy is not from Egypt but somehow, his cooking sure tastes like it. Added bonus is you get to speak colloquial Arabic and they understand!

Yup, it's worth it...",1
3973,10,4,12/1/2009,"I was picking up my girlfriend in the area and figured I'd just grab a quick, greasy dinner from McD's. While waiting for my girlfriend to use the bathroom, I decided to whip out my phone and opened up my trusty Yelp app. So what was hot in the area? Number 1 was King of Falafel and Shawarma. Hmm.. this Yelp app has been bringing me to falafel joints a lot lately. But anyway this place was right up the block and around the corner from McD's. Win. When we got there they had just run out of chicken and the lamb had been long gone. The wait for a new batch took roughly ten minutes. It was freezing and I was standing to wonder whether it was worth the wait. I looked around and a big line began to form behind me. Guess I just had to grit my teeth and suck it up. Not like cold was the worst thing I've endured for chicken & rice (i.e. 53rd & 6th). When we finally got our platter we raced back to the car. Partially because it was cold but more so because we couldn't wait to gorge ourselves. The chicken & rice was delicious. Perfectly seasoned and wasn't dry like other carts usually make their chicken. It seriously rivaled the chicken from the guys at 53rd & 6th. The salad it came with was a bit weird though. Lots of pickled items. I like pickles and all but that seemed like a weird thing to include. It also came with 2 falafels. I see other yelpers seem to rave about the falafels. Mine were hard and a bit on the bland side. Maybe mine were old. All in all this was a satisfying platter. I'd come again but probably pass on the falafel and maybe the salad. So Long Island City has their cart, Midtown's got theirs, I hear Jersey City has some kind of crazy Korean BBQ cart, Brooklyn where you at!?",1
3974,10,5,11/23/2009,"Wow! Great and friendly customer service, especially for a busy cart (sometimes those places can almost THROW the food at you to get to the next customer).

Also, check out the pic I added. It's a sign that I found hilarious at the cart. Yummmmmmey!",1

Â and they were nice enough to give us a falafel to munch on while we waited. Â maybe the whole excitement of the vendys had made it taste even better. Â or maybe it was a little off this night.

3980,10,4,10/11/2009,"My sister from Seattle really wanted to get some NY street meat on her visit. Some of her friends recommended some places in Manhattan -- while I'm sure there are some great street meat vendors in Manhattan, one of the best in all five boroughs is right down the street from where I live! Plus it was pouring rain so we also didn't think it was worth making the trek into Manhattan. I was a bit worried that they wouldn't be out because it was raining but there they were. These guys are troopers. Now to the food. These guys give you SO much food. We got two platters and a kebab for 3 people. It was probably double the amount of food that we really needed. We saved the leftovers to bring to lunch the next day. Yes, leftover street meat and it was still good. The falafels are awesome. They make them fresh right there. Not sure if I like them as much as Mamoun's but they're up there. The meat here is pretty good too.",1

Â  After munching on everything, I came to this verdict: I should've just ordered a bunch of falafels. Â  Don't get me wrong, the chicken and rice was great too. Â The chicken was flavorful and nicely spiced, the rice was solid. Â  But man, the falafel, it was hot, crispycrunchy on the outside, and the inside was packed with wonderful flavor. Â One of the best falafels I've ever had. Â  Tip: Â My other friend said she got them once at off-peak hours, and the falafel was cold and not-so-tasty. Â I got mine at peak lunch hour on a weekday, and there was a line of people around this time, so there was quick turnover, and the guys at the truck were making them fresh really quickly.

So I run up to the place and I place my order... ""1 chicken and rice please"" within 2 mins I have a huge plate with rice, chicken, pickled vegetables, and a falafel just as a tease. The falafel had amazing flavor, nice and moist. the chicken I think was like standard chicken you would get in any cart but the chunks were bigger which added a slightly different texture to it that i liked. The pickled vegetables were delicious, the spicy red sauce had just the right balance of spice and flavor, and the white sauce standard. so overall I will not make the trip all the way there just for the food but if im in the area its definately where im having lunch/dinner",1

3148,10,4,7/7/2009,"I have long been intrigued by street meat. It's the sort of thing my mother would never have let me eat as a child, which definitely induced a healthy fear of it in me. On the other hand, since I moved to the city, the scent of meat and vegetables with all those savory spices has been nothing short of intoxicating. I've often thought that I should give in to hunger and buy a plate of hot food from the corner gyro guy, but my mother's distrust of street meat was always holding me back. Even the fame of the 53rd and 6th cart was not quite enough to lure me in. However, lately Boyfriend's been talking about all the good gyro guys he patronizes, and I've started to get that street meat itch once again. Enter Yelp, which had King of Falafel listed as the third best-reviewed restaurant in the city yesterday. As I happen to work in Long Island City, a mere 15 minute subway ride from Astoria, I took it as a sign that it was time to finally brave the world of such strange fare as ""mixed over rice"" and ""shawarma,"" and hopped on the train after work. As everyone has already said, these guys are incredibly nice and friendly. They put such a smile on my face, and reassured me that I was going to love my first street meat experience. I had ordered shawarma over rice, but the guy insisted that he'd add their chicken so I could try that too, and also tossed in a falafel and gave me another one in a napkin ""to munch on."" How nice is that? And guess what? It WAS good. It was a mish mash of different flavors and textures that melded together nicely, even if it didn't really taste like chicken or lamb as I usually eat them. I was especially brave and let them add some red sauce, and it was spicy, but pleasantly so, which is saying something considering my taste buds' limited tolerance of heat. The falafel was super delicious, and I never really enjoy falafel all that much! I suspect I just get tired of it after a short while, but here they served me the perfect amount. There were some weird pickled pink slices of a vegetable I couldn't quite identify, but I found that I was ok with that. It was also about twice as much food as I could possibly have eaten, even though I was absolutely ravenous. Boyfriend polished off the second half (he's reliable like that), and his only real comment was that they had included an impressive variety of vegetables, so I am assuming it passed muster. All in all, I'd say my first street meat experience was a definite success!",1

Occasionally I would be too lazy to make my own lunch, so I would just stop by Freddy's and bring that for lunch (tastes just as good when microwaved at work! Except for the falafel, which gets mushy). Freddy and the guys are great! Usually when there is a long line/wait, they will give you a falafel to snack on.

Â Many late nights have i been disappointed with the inability to stuff my face with falafel because too many greedy, chick pea starved patrons beat me to the punch.

4003,10,5,1/14/2009,"Every other month or so, my buddies in Astoria host a fairly large Battle of the Bands party using both Rock Band and Guitar Hero for the PS3. Each party has a potluck theme. One battle of the band party was a ""comfort food"" theme and the most recent one they held was a ""Thanksgiving/Holiday"" food theme. It's really just a get together to eat, get drunk, have fun, and mess around with the Rock Band stuff. So each time I head to Astoria, I'm coming from the city by the NW train and exit off Broadway. I am usually carrying a heavy bag of something, whether it be Booze, Fried Chicken, or Cupcakes (trust me, the Asian girls love it when you bring cupcakes). But man, everytime I get off that Broadway exit, I always see and smell King's. I mean I know King's, I've had it many times before, but lately with these damn Rock Band parties, I just want to drop all my heavy bags and get a chicken over rice plate with hot sauce + white sauce with those lovely free and complimentary falafels they put on top!

4004,10,5,12/1/2008,"From my blog. Walking down Broadway in Astoria you are bound to find your senses mesmerized and captivated by the rich Middle Eastern fragrances of an inconspicuous looking food cart known to local patrons as the ""King of Falafel and Shawarma"". You may pass it the first few times, but eventually you too will succumb to the aroma that traps so many bystanders. Serving the Astoria community and foodies since 2002 - this food cart has gained recognition in a wide variety of local, national, and international publications. The head honcho Fares ""Freddy"" Zeideia - is a loquacious man, a savvy entrepreneur, a friendly face and he is also clearly a part of the neighborhood. Freddy loves his craft, this much is apparent in everything he does - it is commonplace to find him chatting it up with a passerby or handing out a few falafel balls to customers as they wait. It is this love, Freddy says, that makes him different from the run of the mill halal cart. As one of the pioneers in halal street food, Freddy has seen the explosion of Middle Eastern food on the streets of New York. While exposure is always good, the King of Falafel is soberly honest about the competition, ""they don't last"", he says. The problem, he explains, is that most of them are in it for the money - with that kind of attitude the customer service is nonexistent and the product suffers. Freddy is on top of his game. He offers a large menu with a wide variety of options. The classics are of course falafel, chicken, and shawarma - all available in pitas or plates over rice and fresh salad. The falafel's are ofcourse famous and will have you coming back for more. The chicken is zesty, herby and delicious. The shawarma platter is a sight to see. The beef/lamb is all trimmed by Freddy himself to ensure the quality is superior to processed meats. It is slow cooked in a rotisserie style and thrown on the grill when ordered for a final singe. Then the shawarma is placed on a bed of rice (two choices yellow or basmati), salad, and a single falafel ball. Before you dig in you are offered sauces, white (mayo based), tahini (sesame puree based), lemon sauce, homemade hot sauce, or bbq sauce. We couldn't resist and went with the shawarma platter. The plate is aesthetically pleasing and the first bite leads to a whirlwind of sensations. Your eyes, nose and tastebuds all take part in the festivities of savory meat, creamy sauce and delicate rice. The falafel ball is a unique creation, not like the standard falafel you find in New York - it's better. The salad is fresh and the pickled beets are a nice touch. The King is not without ambitions. He recently graduated from the Culinary Academy in the Union Square area and has aspirations to one day host a Middle Eastern cooking program. Meanwhile, the quality remains high - I grew up in the neighborhood and it is wonderful to see that popularity hasn't affected the food. All in all, however you slice it, Freddy is a maestro.- Alex",1

3170,10,3,10/1/2008,"I've never ever thought about eating from a halal cart in my life. I didn't even know how to roll my tongue around the WORD ""halal"" before I came to NYC. Also, it's not helpful that I'm such a germaphobe I get sick looking at a hot dog cart. However, you try walking by and resisting the buttery aroma of seasoned meat. A few months of this and I was worn down. It was delicious. Smothered in a creamy white and spicy red sauce, this generous serving of chicken and rice is worth the extra calories and eaters remorse you will surely feel. The rice is slightly yellow (probably from the 800 lbs of butter) and the chicken is tender and flavorful. It comes with lettuce shavings and nice, bright purple pickled radishes. For extra kicks they toss in an extremely flavorful (and fried) falafel. The guys are friendly and the joint is popular. 30th and Broadway. Astoria. That's where it's at. Ya heard?",1

The chicken is soft, and the white sauce + hot sauce combo is perfect! If you've tried the 53rd/6th stand you know that their hot sauce is just way too hot for any normal human to consume. The falafels are also good! It comes with your meal. They'll also give you a complimentary falafel if you're waiting, if you ask, or if you're nice. I almost always get the chicken and rice, but when I don't, I get the chicken and rice on the pita. The prices have gone up slightly but I still come here every chance I get! YUMMM... it is so damn flavorful. I always tell my friends to go get the halal food at the corner when they come visit, and they love and crave it everytime they come back!!! Very happy to give these guys more business, they definitely deserve it.",1
4007,10,5,8/26/2008,"Okay, I have like never eaten from a cart, but I have been in this neighborhood for 3 years and I thought I would try it. This cart always has a long line around it. The aroma of meat and seasonings will drive you crazy. It was a little intimidating walking up to the cart for the first time. The person cooking could tell I was nervous. All I could say was chicken and the tall man said rice with everything. i said YES! Ohh my GOD, the food is so good! Tasty!!!!! ... Well-seasoned and just tasty, for only $6, you get enough food for dinner and lunch the next day. I am so glad I finally stopped!",1

The guy's are really nice, and very friendly.

For less than $4, you can enjoy an amazingly huge, mouthwatering chicken pita wrap. Or, for two bucks more, try the lamb and beef combo. The chicken plate is just as good as any other choice, and the King who makes all this happen is just about the nicest, funniest guy to be doing this kind of job. At The King, it's not just taste that you're getting. Not just the perfect price. You're getting the humblest delicacy that tastes better than any overpriced, complicated dish you can find around the neighborhood.

The decor is proper to the intended audience.....people who work behind computers but spend $300 on ""genuine American"" work shirts from Japan or selvedge denim pants that never see grease or sawdust. Food is merely okay. Absolutely nothing warrants any comment for the price but for two things: they only offer one type of oyster with one type of garnish; the house drinks are made by someone with a sweet tooth.

4015,11,1,7/5/2013,"I really had high hopes for this place because it looks nice and is near where I live but it was bad. It was loud, the staff were rude and pretentious (they make the drinks like they do in that bad Tom Cruise movie called Bartender) they played awfulmusic, it was overpriced, and worst of all, the food was bad. The burger was no different than the one you can get at In And Out Burger but three times and price. We also got the radish salad which was literaly seven whole radishes with sea salt sprinkled on them and one or two sprigs of watercress and it was $12 - I kid you not. Don't go here. waste of time and money.",-1
4016,11,4,10/25/2013,It's an unusual shape. The stools wrap around the bar which sits front and center of the room. I like that even though it's primarily a drinking place the food is great. Who doesn't like a few imaginative offerings to chow down while getting drunk!? What to go for: oysters which come with some cucumber mignonette sauce. Fantastic. Their cocktails are great. Pick whatever you like and I am fairly sure you will not miss.,-1
4017,11,4,8/30/2013,"This place is well worth stoppin by... This place is sexy, with dark corners to commit dark deeds... A deadly weakness in spite of overall strength, that can actually or potentially lead to downfall... It is very close to the water and it was once a watering hole for the dock men who worked on the East River. Now, it still is a watering hole, but for the tattooed hipsters, rockers, and cuties that inhabit the Republic of Brooklyn. A beautiful expansive bar, nooks and crannies to hold clandestine affairs, plank wooden floors, white plastered walls and even wooden crates full of fresh apples paints the picture here... Decent selection of cocktails and beers on offer here, but prices are on par to Manhattan standards... After you've taken your date to Paulie Gee's, come here and take aim with your most poisonous arrow...",-1
4018,11,5,8/27/2013,"Lots of mixed reviews; wasn't sure what to expect. Â But the menu was delicious and as a vegetarian I was pleasantly suprised to find a lot of good, seasonal veggie dishes on the menu. Â The decor is amazing and the place has the vibe of both a neighborhood spot (does everyone here know each other???) and a good place to take out of town friends Â you want to impress. Â The best part was being able to see into the kitchen--an intimate peek you don't get in a lot of places around here, where you can't tell if your food is being scraped off the floor or what. Â The drinks menu is fun and funny, the wine list delish and I'm not going to complain about the prices because each dish was beautifully prepared with lots of delicate touches. Â What's great it that is seems like the menu rotates around a few tasty standards (I won't eat it, but the burger looks deeeeelish and juicy, and the french fries are spot-on), but the specials follow the trends in the market. Â What that means is that if I go in more than twice a month, I'm still pleasantly suprised by various menu options. Â Oh! and the creamy corn dish is to die for. Â I could eat that morning, noon and night.",-1
4019,11,5,5/23/2013,"I love Alameda. Â It's beautifully designed, and when it's packed (which is usually is!), it feels intimate and exciting. Â The drinks are creative and good takes on old classics. Â I've never heard a song I didn't like playing, and the staff are friendly and on their game. Â The food is incredible. Â Everything tastes like an improvement on old standards, with interesting, well-plated twists. This past week I had deliciously prepared radishes and the new cake that made the menu WITH GOLD DUST FROSTING. Â Alameda is some next-level shit: I love that it's landed in my neighborhood.",-1
4020,11,4,1/3/2015,Delightful spot in Greenpoint with some major ambiance focused on the large oval bar that dominates the space. I went with a group and we shared most of our dishes so we were able to get a wide view of the menu. My favorite was the Arctic char which was prepared to a delicate perfection and noticeably well seasoned. The burger was enjoyable as well. I look forward to returning.,1
4021,11,5,12/5/2014,"Gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous bar. Â Great date spot - circular wood bar, lovely locals, fantastic art deco theme (they must have spent a fortune renovating this place). Â  Had a delicious hangover burger here and some vino to set me straight - plus they have a well thought out wine list and the help staff were helpful and attentive. Â  Very cozy, sexy place, can't wait to park myself here for several hours in wintry weather. Â They've got booths here too. Â Do go, but don't tell too many people about it, please.",1
4022,11,4,11/29/2014,I keep coming back for the grilled octopus and the chill atmosphere. Â Great design too!,1
4023,11,5,11/17/2014,"I'm a native NYer with a very high bar for food and service. 5/5 starts for service, food, and decor i went there a couple of weeks ago with two friends. Each course was better than the last. Our meal included: great appetizers, wines paired perfectly (with help from the waitress), delicious entrees, and a dessert that left you wanting more, despite not being able to eat another crumb I was so full. Don't take my word for it - go!",1
4024,11,5,11/9/2014,"I love Alameda. I have been lazy about writing reviews, except in horrible encounters, but I'm writing about Alameda because It's so great. Short but well-curated/diverse list of beers on tap. Great craft cocktails (interesting ingredients and riffs on classics). Again, well-curated/edited wine list. I've eaten here 6+ times over the past 6 months, almost always on Sunday nights. My boyfriend LOVES the cheeseburger and fries. He said it's possibly the best burger he's had in NYC because it's simple and pared down- just juicy meat, a slice of Cheddar, and he puts mayo on the bun. The boquerones, corn dish (summer seasonal), oysters, and trout have all been delicious. The first time we came for food, we had low expectations... but it was so delicious that we kept coming back. One very consistent thing: the staff have always been AMAZINGLY attentive. Not intrusive, but always present, accommodating, and quick to bus table/bring drinks. The lowdown: not for an anniversary dinner, but a great, casual, fun, delicious place to bring your friends, family, co-workers, ANYONE, and have a great time.",1
4025,11,5,10/11/2014,"I love Alameda and I wish they were open for lunch! There are a few places in Greenpoint that really play off of the sea shanty atmosphere, and Alameda does it so well. The rustic wood, the beautiful bar and the long mirrors lend to a dark, romantic atmosphere. One where you can gaze into your lover's eyes across a candle-lit table or sit alone in silence, mentally rewriting page 78 of your novel. Recently, I was doing neither. A few coworkers and I were hungry after a long day at the office, so we settled on Alameda. We got fancy cocktails (I had the 'Little Red Book' and it was so delicious!) and fancy foods. I ordered the sweet corn and the dish haunts me to this day! It was just so simple but good. I really need to make it at home, but until then, I'll visit Alameda over and over again...Lurking in the dark corners, looking way too pensive. (this is probably the most unhelpful Yelp review I've ever written. synopsis: get the corn thing, bring a date, or not. you won't be disappointed. also, my friends swear by the burger)",1
4026,11,5,10/1/2014,"One of my all time favorite hangouts. Food is consistently tasty and the staff is sweet. Menu changes pretty frequently, so there is always something new to try. Lots of seasonal items and cocktails. Good luck staying sober! I can never have just one :) Happy hour is also pretty killer. Not just drink specials, but also discounts on food like the cheeseburger and boquerones. My main tip: GET THE TARTINE.",1
4027,11,5,9/14/2014,"This could easily be one of my favorite spots in New York City. Tucked away on the far end of Franklin Street, Greenpoint's Alameda is a little out of reach but well worth the trek. The space, complete with a circular bar, marble countertops, lights turned low, and subtle rose motifs here and there is simply gorgeous. Perhaps sexier than the ambience, though, is Alameda's menu. The cocktails are clearly a labor of love, each boasting something unexpected but clearly well-thought out. I tried the 'grass monkey,' a blend of coconut liqueur, fresh-squeezed lemon, and Coors banquet. It's basically a combination of summer, childhood, and the Caribbean manifested in drink form. Go to Alameda with a friend and split a few items on the dinner menu. And don't forget to order the Mast Brother's flourless chocolate cake before you leave. It's dusted with sea salt and topped with a few ground cherries. Creme fraiche on the side. Who could ask for anything more?",1
4028,11,5,9/5/2014,"The service was outstanding. The tartine, burger, clams, and flourless chocolate cake are a must.",1
4029,11,3,8/29/2014,"This place is really cute. They serve fresh , local items, and make some unique dishes. I dined shortly as a stop on the bon appetite grub crawl. The dishes served included sardines and radishes... Not exactly my cup of tea. They did however serve some awesome cheese fries with bacon. I don't think id return, however it was nice to experience something different.",1
4030,11,5,8/29/2014,"Wonderful ambience, great food, amazing staff. We got the fish, burger and cheese fries. Don't even get me started about the bacon cheese fries, heaven in your mouth. The menu is not extensive, but don't let that scare you away. Start with a glass of vino or a beer and then move forward to the cheese fries, and then I bet you'll be hooked. There's also a cute outdoor patio out front for people watching, and it's not that busy of a street, so pretty quiet all in all.",1
4031,11,5,7/26/2014,"Loved this place! Wonderfully complex but light dinner options. Great, unexpected flavor combos. The cocktails and service are just as sparkling. One of my personal favorite dining experiences I've had in the past couple years because it hit everything I'm looking for in for a date or low-key celebration spot: pretty intimate, not overcrowded, played a surprising amount of The Nerves, which made it feel like my living room, super flattering lighting from art deco, futurist chandeliers. I will definitely be back again. My server was super knowledgeable and crazy cute while still being really casual and conversational--which kind of encapsulates this place. High brow ideas but in jeans and tees. Tonight was my first time, but not so for the others in my party, who recommended this place expressly for the drink selection when our original destination had a 90-min estimated wait. I enjoyed the food as much as I did my mezcal-absinthe concoction: salted cantaloupe, purple basil & mozzarella salad, then chilled mussels in an herbed oil served with crusty bread. I will back again--soon! Highly recommended!",1
4032,11,3,7/13/2014,"Had a great time at Alameda the other night. First off: the decor! When you walk in it certainly has that wow factor with the giant U shaped bar. I felt like I just entered the 1950s with the finishes and decor. We were seated immediately with our group of 4 in a quaint little nook. I did notice the restaurant was super hot- maybe because of the large crowd but during summer it was pretty uncomfortable. The menu is on the smaller size which I am learning to appreciate given it normally includes seasonal items and each item has a little more attention drawn to it. I had the fresh tomato ricotta crostini which was delicious. It had some kind of basil sauce added to it which made it super fresh and flavorful. The burger was also really yummy as was the octopus entree. Drinks were on the pricier side but also a good selection. I like how chill the atmosphere is and also impressive at the same time. We weren't overly hungry so Alameda served a good selection if you wanted to chow down or have a small bite and get out of the house. It was definitely pricier than other restaurants in the area but has the show stopping atmosphere which makes it worth the experience. Stars were knocked off because of prices, the general heating system, and that our waitress sort of rushed us out (not intentionally, but she was a bit too eager to hand us the check). Regardless, I will be back!",1
4033,11,4,6/6/2014,"Delicious food and delicious drinks. Had the burger and pimento cheese fries were fantastic! I love a nice cocktail and they didn't disappoint. Decor is nice. There are tables but not that many, it's a great place if you like to sit at the bar as the bar is the focus of the restaurant.",1
4034,11,5,5/19/2014,"We really liked Alameda.Nice decor,cozy atmosphere,great for date.The burgers were really nice,plenty of fries and great wine selection.We also liked the desserts.Really good service,very friendly!We ll definitely go back",1
4035,11,5,5/15/2014,"What a great surprise! Â My husband and I were on our way to the place across the street - can't remember the name but also great - and walked by Alameda. We decided to have a cocktail at their big bar. Super friendly service. Delicious martini. We decided to get an appetizer. Delicious. Boquerones. By this point we were settled in so we stayed. The food was perfectly cooked and the vibe was just what we needed. Dim lighting, friendly atmosphere, good music. Will be a regular!",1
4036,11,5,5/9/2014,"Finally, a place with a cool vibe, I especially love the crowds & energy. I really like how their menu changes it gives my husband & I great reasons to bring friends in with us to have an interesting evening. It's chill, not uptight, you can hang for as long as you want, very personable staff, i highly recommend you give it a try!",1
4037,11,4,4/27/2014,"Very nice menu and the ambience is OK if you don't mind a significant din when it's crowded and the rock music is blaring. Wonder what the vibe would be if they played 'trad jazz' to compliment their excellent cocktail menu? The music should not distract from the food. The decor is lovely and very tasteful w/ a deco/vintage vibe and lots of wood and tile. The small plates came a little too fast and the warm plates cooled while we were finishing the first ones. Everything was good, the pea tartine, trotters w/ sauce, and the soft-shell crab lightly fried and served w/ a ramp sauce and chilled rapini was the winner this night. We'll be back!",1
4038,11,4,2/20/2014,"Super cute, great ambiance, good for small groups or a date. Cocktails are $12 but worth it - nice balance, strong enough but not overpowering. Sat at the bar, bartenders were 2 dudes, both really nice and didn't bother too much. Cocktails: had the double dark and stormy - which if you know dark and stormy's, was awesome. They use 2 types of rum and housemade ginger beer. Also enjoyed a good burger (grass fed, pretty tasty, prepared perfectly at med rare to medium. Fries were a bit too salty, overpowered the otherwise decent fries. Price wise: little expensive, more than most other spots in Greenpoint. But worth it for the ambiance, service. Lots of little touches that make it really pleasant (if you care about those things): like the little white tiles they use on the walls that match the tiles on the interesting beer tap, stools are comfy and fit the mood (also white), lighting fixtures and iPads for inputting orders are in dark wood, all appear custom made. It's the small touches and attention to detail that makes this place.",1
4039,11,3,2/9/2014,"I had an OK experience at Alameda last night. The restaurant looks very nice, mildly rustic with an interestingly-shaped bar. Service was fast and prompt. Unfortunately, the food wasn't great. The burger I got was small, overly salty, and very messy to eat after one bite. The fries were over-fried, and crispy to the point where they barely had any flavor. My girlfriend had the octopus - I am not much for seafood, but the bite I had of hers was good and not rubbery. My girlfriend was also a little disappointed by the ""Phil Collins"" she had, and the sip I had was tart and salty in a way that didn't totally work with the drink. Maybe I'll come back here for a drink in the future, but with restaurants popping up at a steady clip throughout Greenpoint, I might need a little persuasion to go back.",1
4040,11,5,11/13/2013,"The butternut squash and brussel sprouts were to DIE for - really beautifully balanced flavors. The atmosphere was casually romantic, and the wait staff was very friendly.",1
4041,11,4,11/4/2013,"The main thing I learned from my experience at Alameda is that I do NOT like my mussels cooked with bacon (or was it pancetta?). Either way, the meaty porkiness was sort of unpleasant. My date's burger was tasty and the fries were perfect. The Saint Joseph Sour with Old Overholt and Velvet Falernum was delicious. My favorite of the night was the double dark & stormy with their house ginger brew... the Â spiciest dark & stormy I've ever had. Very intense, which is a good thing in my book. The interior is stunning - cozy and romantic, and the staff is very friendly. I will be back for drinks and maybe some fries.",1
4042,11,3,10/15/2013,"I'm torn. With Brooklyn Star vets running this gig, I had pretty high expectations. Pros: *beautiful space *plenty of room *good food Cons: *horrible service *really bad service *not the best service I had a dish of scallops with roasted cauliflower and it was done very well, along with a side of fries. Things were a bit pricey for the area and size of food, but if it's good,...fine. It appears as if the menu changes daily, and, though small, seems well-curated. The space definitely gives off more of a bar than restaurant vibe, but I liked that the tables lined the walls and that there was ample seating around the large centrally placed bar. I really don't demand too much, but the bartenders seemed more interested in doing anything else besides wait on my friend and I. It was really difficult to wave them down (and this was on a wednesday....they weren't even busy) just to order a drink, and even harder to track them down to get food. I was pretty turned off by their attitude, especially since I really want to like this place. I'd go back to try it again, but if I get the same 'tude again...I might have to call it quits.",1
4043,11,4,10/11/2013,"This place was designed by one of the more prominent interior design companies doing many of the new restaurants in the area. It's that simple retro look that has been trending for a few years here. The food seems secondary to the bar. The menu in not very descriptive, the waitress said that the chef wanted customers to talk to the waitstaff about the menu instead, so I started asking questions (hey I'll play): Q. ""What kind of meat is the sausage?"" A. I don't know. Q. ""Where is the mackerel from, is it Atlantic mackeral?"" A. ""I don't know."" Q. ""How is the fois gras breakfast sandwich prepared? Is it whole or pate?"" A. ""I don't know"" I got the burger, medium, so did my wife. My wife ordered the only cider that they had on the menu. She thought something was weird about it. I tasted it and it was like drinking rotten olive brine.The waitress took it back to the bar. When she came back she explained that it is some organic cider aged in barrels or something and it was supposed to taste like that, but it isn't for everyone, and they wouldn't charge us for it. At this point she told us that she had just started there and wasn't familiar with the menu yet. On one hand I was like OK, you're new here, but on the other, there are like 6 things on the menu. If the chef is going to impose the sort of regime that requires a diner to pull information from the waitstaff, they should make sure the waitstaff is prepped. I like the vibe of this place, but despite the burger being among the least expensive in the hood it somehow feels like they are charging too much for things. I have been there one other time and tried one of their seasonal fish plates, at the time fluke was in. It was a phenomenal appetizer. Overall I think the food is very good. I guess my biggest issue is with the name. Now there are three restaurants with nearly identical names in Greenpoint. I am embarrassed to admit that I have found myself standing in front of the wrong one waiting for people more than once. ""Meet me at Alemeda"" ""Ok I'll see you at Adelina"" ""No, No, I said Anella"" ""Wait, no, I mean Adelina, Shoot now I forgot"" ""Let's just go to Habitat""",1
4044,11,4,10/7/2013,"Surprising little gem in a quiet section of Greenpoint. I was drawn to this place based on the yelp reviews for their burgers, and while I didn't try the burger, others in my party seemed to enjoy them. Located in a narrow store front, there doesn't appear to be much seating inside, but you'd be surprised. The best part was the outdoor garden where we enjoyed our 330 brunch. While the menu was somewhat limited, they definitely offered a solid variety of breakfast and lunch favorites. I went with the chicken parm sandwich and the fries. The fries were AMAZING. Large steak fries that were cooked very well and not mushy. Â One of my friends boasted it was one of the best bloody Mary's he's had in NY. I stuck with the craft beer myself. Â The bacon was very good too. Unfortunately this place is extremely out it the way if you're traveling by subway. Nevertheless I will return if I ever make it back to that part of the hood.",1
4045,11,3,9/21/2013,"Love the burger and the salad. The greens from Eagle Street Farm are great. I would give this another star if the service wasn't so spotty. We've been here four or five times. The last time, our drinks came with our dinner. We ordered another round, and it never came. For $10 or $11 you get a juice glass full or wine, which is a bit of highway robbery. Â We ordered the mussels once and they tasted as if they came from a can. For the price, we thought the food would be totally fresh, and for $16 an entree, nothing on the dish should be canned. If they could just fix these minor issues, they'd be great.",1
4046,11,5,9/7/2013,Excellent bar.,1
4047,11,3,9/6/2013,The interior is so cute and the bar tednder was super charming. Def my fave bloody marry in the world next to Lindas in Seattle. BUT-- the scallops were sandy and not that great. Over cooked. $17 for 3 just ok scallops is not my jam. The herb sausage was not great either and the fries made my stomach hurt. The waitress never came to check on us and the food took forever. Not going back unless it is to hit on the bar tender / to have a bloody marry.,1
4048,11,5,8/28/2013,"Awesome place! Finally, a Greenpoint chef with some creative vegetable ideas! Super friendly staff. Cool circular bar. Disorienting funhouse entrance. Highly recommended.",1
4049,11,4,8/23/2013,"went in not knowing what to expect and were pleasantly surprised. i got the cranberry beans and they were absolutely delicious. seriously order these if they are on the menu they were awesome. 3 stars for the cranberry beans alone! we also split the tartine which i LOVED. flavors of both dishes were nicely balanced and interesting and both dishes memorable id definitely go back just to eat them again. boyfriend got the burger and thought it was pretty solid for $11 - actually cheap compared to other restaurants in brooklyn. as a vegetarian who didn't want trout, i left a little bit hungry. Â  drinks were good not mind-blowing but what you'd expect. and the atmosphere is super cute! although i didn't notice the bathroom sink - damn.",1
4050,11,1,8/17/2013,"I won't be coming back here. The interior was well done, especially the bathroom sign. The drinks are fine. Not great, not bad. Just fine. There are better options in the neighborhood at the same or lesser price. The oysters were the best thing on the menu. But at $3 an oyster, there are better options in the neighborhood at a lesser price. The food was ok. We had the gazpacho, which I've made better myself. The octopus was paired with cucumbers and thinly sliced jalapeÃ±o with a heavy dose of vinegar. The trout came on a bed of cherry tomatoes and fingerling potatoes over a tart kind of spread of indeterminable content. With both dishes my impression was the same - the ingredients just sort of co-existed on the plate with little thought put in to how they might interact. They looked nice. Nothing was burned or anything, but nothing really worked together. Overall, it's just another mediocre overpriced Brooklyn restaurant that leans way too heavily on the TGI-Friday's fake old timey schtick (See also: Rye, Walter Foods, Marlowe & Sons, et all). Our bill was just north $120 and we left hungry. That's about the same let down per dollar as River Styx, but without enjoying delicious-tasting, inventive food and cocktails. But whatever, overpriced faux-sentimental so-called ""new"" American mediocrity is what Brooklyn dining has become. Why the one star review? The bathroom sink has separate handles and spouts for hot and cold water. They built the bathroom in this restaurant. It used to be a coffee shop with a different layout, so there's no historical excuse. The cook that just took a dump has to play a game between scalding hot and freezing cold water instead of thoroughly washing his hands before he shucks your raw oysters because the owners thought that the fake old timey schtick was just too cool to pass up. If they wanted to be all Mumford & Sons and pretend that pre-prohibition life wasn't an intense rush to an untimely death by lack of hygiene then that lack of imagination is on them, but couldn't they at least have a plumber join the hot and cold pipes before splitting it under the sink so that both came out warm? Or hey, since they already went full-retard, why not just include the drain plug those old-timey sinks came with so people would fill the basin, wash their hands, and then drain it? Oh, because then people would actually talk about what a inconvenient problem it was instead of returning to their table with fecal matter on their hands. Bon Appetit, Alameda!",1
4051,11,4,8/12/2013,"Gorgeous place-- from the Mission-style-meets-Army-canteen light fixtures to the art deco chevron tiling, it's a cozy place to grab dinner or drinks. Cocktails were a bit small, but perfectly (!) mixed and the food was top notch. Staff was welcoming and warm. We ordered almost entirely from the specials menu and were very happy with the flavors. We especially enjoyed the radish salad with raw goat's milk cheese-- very unexpected and a great balance of bite and smooth creaminess. Looking forward to coming back.",1

Don't be fooled by the short menu you may see online for this spot; while the regulars are really good (I'm a fan of the burger) the secret is in the handful of specials that are listed daily. Think fresh, in season veggies and fish, with interesting flavors and prepared perfectly. The spot itself is super chill but full (not packed) with locals who feel like having a good drink or meal. Yup, I'm addicted. Check it out.",1

Â The staff was really nice and patient, and despite being slammed, the service was good. Â  A couple drawbacks.. Super loud inside. Â Not the music... In fact the soundsystem sounded pretty good. I could tell they have a sub. Nice. Â Something about the acoustic of this place I guess. The menu is really not exciting to me. Â Everything is fresh, and the greens grow on a rooftop a block away, so that's cool. Â Things just felt a little too complicated. Â So I decided to go simple and order a burger. Â The burger ONLY comes with american cheese... I Fu*king hate american cheese! So I asked if I could substitute a different kind of cheese, and the answer was no. There was literally nothing else that looked very good on the menu, so I reluctantly accepted. The burger itself was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. Â  My wife got a sausage on a roll. Â That was alright, but I dont know for $12... The fries were SO salted I spent a minuet brushing them off before eating each one. Â  All in all I will absolutely come back here to drink, but i'd never order food here again. Â I could see it being okay if they serve brunch for some reason, but I guess i'll find out.",1
4056,11,4,6/11/2013,"Alameda may be the new kid in town, but they have a few tricks up their sleeves. I stopped by on a Thursday for a post-work cocktail and dinner around 6:15pm, and it was no problem getting a table. There is a handsome circular bar in the center of the restaurant as well, which was mostly available. The menu is compact and very reasonably priced, as were the portions. My friend ordered the pork belly, which was more of an appetizer, but tasty nonetheless. I chose the baguette sandwich, which had spiced stewed fruit, arugula, and a creamy local cheese. It was served warm, and I added a small side of fries. The baguette was a nice riff on the fruit and creamy cheese concept, and the bite of arugula cut through it appropriately. The fries were great too, adorned with crunches of sea salt and fresh ground pepper. Alameda really is the perfect neighborhood restaurant.",1

Good vibes in there too. Drinks are pretty good, nothing very special, River Styx has a far better drink menu. I've eaten there twice and theres not a lot to love. Its OK. Berger, eh. Salads are pretty standard. Whats with the sausage sandwich? C'mon guys. Lets hope they develop a better menu with an actual focus on food quality that lives up to the interior.",1
4058,11,2,5/26/2013,"I watched this place get built. I loved the old Greenpoint Cafe but not the place that resided there in between the Cafe and Alameda. I was really hoping for an essential spot and am disappointed to report Alameda isn't that. Decor: First thing I was struck by was how NEW the place smelled inside. All of the really well done wood work and ""old"" vibe was undermined by the fact that you could still smell the wood glue and varnish. You can't make a place look and feel old while using all new materials. Still, the woodworking over the bar and the light fixtures are incredible. But the dead space between the wall and the left side of the bar was off putting. In general, it was a decent attempt to achieve that ""old is new"" vibe that every restauranteur seems to think appropriate for ""Brooklyn"" but other places achieve it with suitably old materials and/or keep original elements of the sites. Nighttime was kinder on the decor. Drinks: I had their ""Alameda Manhattan"" which was far far too sweet for my liking. I couldn't taste the rye (nothing more than Old Overholt but still...) to save my life. When I asked for a regular Manhattan for my 2nd drink, I was given another ""Alameda Manhattan"". I'm not a fan of cocktails designed to hide the taste of their component liquors. One of my dining companions had a good gin martini. The rest had stuff from bottles so nothing else to say there. Food: I was disappointed to discover they only had ONE type of oyster (Wellfleet) on offer and they could only be gotten with their cucumber mignonette. Thankfully, the mignonette was good. I should have suspected something was up when the hamburger couldn't be ordered medium rare b/c it comes ""medium"". It's really quite small.....backyard BBQ size and on what looks like a potato bread bun from the grocery store. It tasted good but only when I thought of it as a backyard burger. Underwhelming for $11 with a handful of fries. My vegetarian friend had some kind of sandwich with jam, frisee, and fried pears on it. I didn't bother to try it. She didn't love it. Conclusion: I'm not really sure why this place is always so crowded. Everything was merely ok to good....nothing to crowd up for and no seriously compelling reason to go back. I didn't hate it, but if I want a good cocktail and interesting food, I'd rather walk down to Williamsburg. Unfortunately, Greenpoint still needs a good cocktail bar.",1
4059,11,3,5/17/2013,"Alameda has potential, but its downright greedy. The artichoke is excellent, but I would eat them out of a jar at the supermarket and say the same thing. The burger is good, but its a shake shack sized single patty (too thin to cook medium-rare) and for 11 bucks with handful of fries, a bit of a ripoff. I considered buying a 2nd one, but decided against it. A sausage for 11 bucks is just abusive for bar food (compare to the 6 dollar one at black rabbit a couple blocks away), and my main gripe, if you're gonna serve me a 10 dollar drink in a 6 oz wine glass, it better not be bottom shelf overholt rye, (and if I choose to go with the cheap stuff, I should be rewarded with a big fat, boozy, indulgent cheap drink due to the lack of cost to you, not a dainty cocktail that is fairly expensive and gone in 3 sips). Inside is nice and has a good atmosphere, but my idea of a good time isn't staring at a nicely curated vintage stool. I'm just not gonna drop 70 bucks on a round of drinks, a shared app, and a sausage and cheeseburger, and leave hungry and sober. My issue wasn't with the quality or execution of anything, as everyone seems to be trying their best, just with portion size and price and my fear that new restaurants are geared toward treating greenpointers like they are dining in soho. I hope that they pull it together and become more of a bar for the people. Service was very good, but in a bar that small, its not even really necessary. Bottom line is that Alameda is too fancy for its own good and could benefit from a little more substance and a little less fluff.",1

We had a reservation for 21:30 but got our table after waiting an hour in a cold waiting room where there were +/- 20 people waiting for a table. When we finally got our table, in the very poorly furnished and depressing basement , we got the Christmas menu . At first It looked ok until we got our first plate. The presentation was terrible and certainly not worthy of a 'restaurant'. The 'matching' wines were not 'matching ' and were very badly chosen. The quality of the materials were inferior leaving me and my girlfriend with abdominal pain with a few visits to the bathroom as a result. The service was really bad. When serving a plate, no explanation was given, suddenly, after a few minutes, someone asked if we knew what was on our plates? After this 'explanation' we could start . All glasses (6 courses) remained on the table. There were 12 glasses on our table at the end of our meal. At the end of our meal we got a glass with tap water! When you pay +/- 1.000,- dollars for two people you expect more !!! This was a very bad experience and I would recommend the chef and his staff to close the 'restaurant', go to culinary school and start over !!!

4071,490,1,12/31/2011,"We recently dined at Bouley for a much anticipated birthday dinner and were also regrettably brought down to the basement, but an additional fact struck us: Â the over-representation of minority diners in the basement room. Â This might have gone unnoticed given the diversity of our city, but for the fact that we arrived about the same time as a colleague of mine and his wife (both white). Â Somehow our French host managed to find room for them in the main dining room, but herded my husband and I (both Asian) downstairs. Â When we asked to be moved, we were told that we could wait 15-30 minutes for another table in the same room (the upstairs did not even appear to be an option). Â We watched a similar pattern unfold as the evening progressed - the vast majority of guests brought downstairs were of ethnic extraction. Â If, as a waiter told us, the basement room is intended for private parties, Mr. Bouley would be better served by keeping it as such, rather than as a subterranean second tier.

Â  When I spoke with the hostess, she said they were seating people roughly 30 minutes after their reservation.

Compare to being a princess in Le Bernardin or Jean-Georges, you feel like, well, a normal person. OMG, the restroom is so odd and cold.

Â hopes that were quickly dashed. Â  there was something seriously wrong at the restaurant on this night. Â when all was said and done, we had the distinct impression that several key players at the restaurant had died that very day and had been quickly replaced with local actors. Â no one save the sommelier and one of the side waiters had even the slightest clue what they were doing, and it looked as if the hostess had been crying. we were seated in the lower basement level, and were repeatedly treated to the sound of crashing plates. Â a door opened right onto our table and waiters passing through repeatedly bumped my chair. Â we had ordered the smaller tasting menu, which turned into a three+ hour endurance match. Â wine pairings were ordered with each course, but we had to literally beg to have them brought out - so by the time we got the pairing for the course, the food had been sitting out long enough to become cool from that aforementioned drafty door. course arrivals were spaced out erratically - at first rather quickly, but then with exceedingly long waits in front of empty un-removed plates. the people around us were experiencing similar feats of non-service and were alternately agitated and demoralized by the ordeal. one older gentleman was repeatedly asking for his check - from literally every member of the staff that came anywhere near. Â and it took a good hour before he was finally given it. Â someone involved with the restaurant seemed to know things were seriously screwed up and attempted to assuage every table around us with a complimentary creme brulee.. but this was on top of the already large quantity of dessert course served.

4076,490,2,11/5/2014,"David Bouley Reneges on Gift Certificate Donation Dined at Bouley this summer and although the food, decor and the whole Bouley experience was what one would expect from a restaurant of this caliber, it is not likely I would ever go back. Â I felt I was treated poorly and condescendingly at the restaurant. Â This was not just by the staff but by Mr. Bouley himself. Â The incident involved a gift certificate I had won at a charity event for Pediatric Cancer. Â It seems the restaurant did not recognize the certificate although I referred to it when I made the reservation, confirmed the reservation and upon my arrival at the restaurant. Â It was only during dessert that I was Â informed of the problem. Â It put the damper on a lovely evening and so I asked for Mr. Bouley's email address in order to make a formal complaint. Â I was told that Mr. Bouley does not do email but he requested that I should go to the kitchen to meet with him. Â Dressed as you can imagine I was, I was not inclined to go to the kitchen. Â Mr. Bouley came out and instead of suggesting that perhaps he take a swipe of my credit card and we could sort it all out in the morning, proceeded to tell me in front of my guests that we should understand that people try to scam him all the time. Â When asked to explain why we were not informed about the ""irregular"" charity certificate, he blamed it on the inexperience of his staff as if that were my problem. Â Doesn't the price of the meal include competent staff? Â And shouldn't you give your customers the benefit of the doubt that they are not scamming you considering they have just spent well over the amount of the gift certificate? Â Mr. Bouley did not handle this well and his ego was enormous. Â After treating us as if we were begging him for charity instead of patronizing his restaurant, he thought a complimentary glass of champagne would make it all OK. Â It did not. Â All of us at the table had been to Bouley before and although we do not regularly dine in that fashion (we do not manage hedge funds), we do dine that way a number of times a year and there are many restaurants in the city of this caliber. Â I could easily take my business to a different restaurant the next time and recommend others do the same.",-1
4077,490,2,9/9/2014,"I had the pleasure of dining at David Bouley on 9/1/14 or at least I thought it would be a pleasurable experience. On arrival my wife and I were greeted and were told that our table was almost ready. So we took a seat close to the door, and when the pompous maÃ®tre 'd appeared, he looked at us, and then looked over his seating chart. He Â had a young lady seat us rather than do it himself as he had just seated the customer before us. After passing by many available tables upstairs, I noticed that we were heading to the back of the restaurant and down the stairs to a small dining room that was nicely appointed; however, little did we know but we had just been relegated to the ""David Bouley Dungeon for Tourists."" Â As one who has dined all over the world, I started to say something, but bit tongue and looked forward to a great wine and food experience. From here we went down hill. I asked for the wine list and with the help of the sommelier,we chose a half bottle of a small grower champagne and a half bottle of an 09 Burgundy. Interestingly, both bottles were retrieved by the sommelier and shown to me while he held them in one hand. The champagne was immediately tasted and served and the Burgundy was tasted. While toasting our champagne the sommelier started pouring the Burgundy which startled me; however, I chose to keep quiet and wait on the food. (By pouring both wines either the sommelier was either trying to sell me more wines or he just did not want to come back to the dungeon again to serve the Burg. To my chagrin, it was both.) So now we settle in for the great dinner. It was anything but that. We chose not to have the tasting menu and ordered a la carte from the menu. We both chose the wild mushrooms with Toro. Both appetizers were barely warm at best and my wife's Toro was fishy. Again we still had faith but told the waiter about the Toro. When the waiter tried to tell us that the Toro tasted that way, I could not hold my tongue any longer, and let the waiter know that I had eaten Toro many times in Japan and stateside, and if fresh, it does not taste fishy. He later came back and said it was because of the marinade--I just shook my head at his comment. Next my wife had the salmon, and I had the duck prepared as Chef saw best. To say the least when I took my first bite, the dish was barely warm again. At that point I confronted the waiter, that I thought David Bouley was suppose Â to be a great restaurant, and that Â it was obvious to me that the Chef was not even at the restaurant. The duck was quickly removed, and I was asked if I would like another dish. I was reluctant, but agreed to the striped bass which was prepared perfectly and was served nice and hot. By the time my dish was served, my wife's salmon was cold and now needed to be warmed. It did however come back quickly. (On a good note, I was not charged for the duck or bass; however, to get something free at DB was not my intention, I came to have a great dining experience.) Â To make up for all the issues, we were plied with deserts. Thanks but no thanks--I do not need all the sugar and my wife did not care for desert that night. So that was our night at David Bouley which I will never set foot in again as I consider it not a good restaurant. However, on the whole, the service was good but you cannot eat the service. The sommelier obviously was over serving the wine and certainly did not want to return to the dungeon. Per the food, well my review speaks for that abomination. The maÃ®tre d' at the front of the house is pompous and appears to only greet and seat those he knows; however, on leaving, I thought I was his best friend--I just turned around and gave him ""the look."" Also, I never once saw him show his face in the dungeon. Lastly, if you are from out of town, insure you are Â not seated in the dungeon where I believe you are not treated as the patrons upstairs. New York has too many great restaurants to chance getting a mediocre food Â and wine experience as we had at David Bouley. Â  Bill Nunnelly",-1

Unfortunately, I left quite disappointed with the experience. I had the special lunch menu of five courses...none were a culinary ""wow"". Although the quality of each ingredient was superb, I felt that the somewhat exotic additions to each dish resulted in less than wonderful flavors. Please note I welcome creative cusine; I simply feel Bouley's attempts at modernity did not work. Service was also less than expected for a restaurant of this reputation. We waited more than 5 minutes after being seated before anyone came to to take our orders. I ran out of water midway through the meal; no one came to refill it until I was almost finished with the dessert course. We had several waiters bring courses,and we were never served by the lady who originally took our orders. I find this odd. I actually wish I could give Bouley a 3.5 rating. Needless to say, I do not intend to return to this restaurant.",-1
4089,490,3,5/27/2013,pretty cool place. service ok...had to wait...,-1
4090,490,3,2/13/2013,"Upon arrival at the restaurant, we were greeted at the gorgeous coat check room by the aroma of fresh apples. Â As we were escorted into the highly ornate dining room, we felt the staff was slightly stuffy and pretentious, but that feeling would eventually dissipate as mistakes were made by the staff, and unprofessional behavior was observed. Â  We had a 6:00 pm reservation, so as soon as we sat, the complimentary amuse came right away. Â We were surprised that the food came so fast, especially when we have not even looked at the menu or ordered yet. Â Between the two of us, we ordered one 6-course tasting menu (4 savory and 2 dessert) and one a la carte menu. Â So here are the details of what we ate: -Porcini Flan, Dungeness Crab, Truffle Dashi: Probably the best dish of the night, the ""flan"" was made in a traditional tasting chawanmushi, with freshly picked crab. Â The menu said Porcini flan, but we had a difficult time finding any porcini here. Â Could be infused in the flan? -Wild Mushrooms, Toro, Truffle Dressing: Â  With a combination of Maitake, Porcini, Oyster Mushroom, Enoki and what looked like mousseron mushrooms, this was another delicious dish. Â The menu says Toro on it, but no one at the restaurant explained what type of fish this ""toro"" came from. Â As an additional comment, I can't imagine all the mushrooms on this dish is actually ""wild"" with the exception of the porcini and mousseron mushrooms. Â  -French Wild Turbot: The menu had no description on the garnish of this dish, so I asked the captain when he took the order. Â He explained that it had pinenuts, squash puree, porcini. Â He also said that it was pan roasted. Â When this dish came out, the back server described that it was hearts of palm on the dish, when it actually was a slice of porcini on top. Â In addition, the turbot seemed to have been poached or steamed instead of pan roasted. Â  -Pistachio-Miso Marinated Black Cod: A riff on the classic Japanese dish of miso marinated cod, the fish on the dish was excellent, and cooked well. -New England Black Sea Bass, Beets, Turnips, Rutabaga: Another great dish, combining diced rutabaga and beets, with a puree of Japanese turnips, which the captain mistakenly described as ""almond foam."" -Long Island Duck, Dates, Polenta, Huckleberry: I've had many great duck dishes and this was not one of the best one. Â First of all, it was poorly cooked. Â The skin side of the breast seemed to have been seared too long as half the flesh on the duck was grey and over cooked, while the bone side of the breast meat was still a medium-rare. Â The date puree underneath provided a nice sweetness to the dish, but I could not find anything resembling a huckleberry on it. Â  -Lychee Sorbet, Clementines: A refreshing palate cleanser, delicious and straight forward. -Pineapple Souffle: A souffle with diced pineapples and a pistachio ""soup"" on the bottom. Â I thought this was too sweet for my taste, and the souffle itself was a little soupy as well. Â A dish that I would probably not order again. Â  So that was my description of the dishes we had. Â Overall, we enjoyed most of the savory courses, and thought the desserts were overall too sweet. Â The staff were overall friendly, but thought they could have more knowledge of the food, given the Â discrepancies in the food descriptions. Â The bread service on the cart was also a great addition to the dining experience here, with a delicious assortment of fresh baked breads. Â The dining room here was beautiful and we would come back for the decor alone. Â  At the very end, as we walked out of the restaurant, we peered into the window from outside which looked into the kitchen. Â It is always exciting to see the kitchen at work, but as we were watching, a front of the house staff, who looked like a busser or kitchen server, was coming to the sink to drop off dirty dishes. Â As he was doing so, he looked me in the eye and continued to eat something off of the dirty plates that just came back from the guest's table. Â We thought that this was disgusting and completely unprofessional, especially knowing that he is being watched. Â This act by this one person completely ruined our impression of the restaurant, and makes you think what else could be going on when they are NOT being watched. Overall, we give the restaurant's decor 5 stars, the food 3.5 stars, and the service with the unprofessional behavior 2 stars, giving it an average of 3.5 stars.",-1
4091,490,3,1/11/2013,Service was great. Food was good. Disappointed they serve toro - more commonly know as blue fin tuna. Here's why: newswatch.nationalgeograâ€¦,-1
4092,490,3,11/17/2012,"Went to Bouley for the first time last night. You first walk into a small foyer with fresh apples lining the walls. Â Wow, the smell was amazing. Â Great first impression. The main restaurant must be one of the most beautiful rooms in NYC, which we noticed as we were lead through the main dining room to the stairs leading to the lower level, or basement as we call it in NJ. Â OK, we're open minded let's see what this is about. Â The lower level is also beautiful, but smaller and, well, the basement. Â  The service is top flight across the board. Â Aspects of the food are also top flight, but only aspects. Â My lobster was just OK, and my wife's was mushy (for those of you not familiar with this technical industry term it means...mushy,) and she couldn't finish it. Â At Bouley! Â Now we're not that picky but when we go to a restaurant the caliber of Bouley and spend this amount of money we expect great food across the board, no exceptions. Â  As we emerge from the basement to which we had been relegated and into the main dining room which at this point was in full swing, Wow, what an incredible vibe. Â Again, this has to be one of the most beautiful rooms in NYC. Â On the way out we received a lemon cake to go, nice touch. Before you go to Bouley my advice is to check the menu carefully (in all fairness not our ideal menu,) expect the possibility of aspects of the food not being great and before you drop 500 beans for two people insist on sitting in the main dining room.",-1
4093,490,3,8/4/2012,"Great ambiance, the foie gras was too rich and bland",-1
4094,490,3,8/11/2011,"Probably 3.5 stars. Â I had some interesting food here at lunch. Â They favor bitter greens too much for my taste, and the beef cheeks were just OK. Â The wife's chicken was pretty terrible. Â But she had some sort of egg concoction that was lovely, and I had a nice soup. Â I dig the space as well, particularly downstairs.",-1
3539,490,3,10/30/2010,"The first time I ate at Bouley was in 1996. My mother in-law took my husband (fiancÃ©e at that time) and me for dinner to celebrate our graduating Graduate School from Columbia. The experience for me was beyond divine. Even though it was almost 12 years ago, I still remember being delighted by every course we were served! Little did I know at that time that Bouley would close down that very year. I've never forgotten that meal. I really think it was one of the best meals I have ever had....in my entire life! So, after 12 long years of Bouley having closed, reopened, moved locations and so on, I finally went back to try it one more time.This time I went for lunch. They have a great pre-fix deal for lunch for $48. I have to say that overall I was disappointed with this meal. The two outstanding things I ate were the Crab-Porcini mushroom flan and the dessert. The rest of the meal was just okay. I would go back again though. Bouley is such a charming place, with impeccable service and grace. I really enjoyed the experience and parts of the meal were outstanding. It's hard to judge a place like Bouley based on just one meal and one menu. I still believe that Chef David Bouley can recreate the magic that I experienced 12 years ago and I am willing to go back and try.",-1

4096,490,3,4/20/2007,"Bouley is one of the most celebrated restaurants in the country. Â Back in 1996, it occupied a truly unique spot on Duane street in lower Manhattan. Â I used to pass it on the walk home from work everyday and could smell the unbelievable ingredients being prepared inside. Â At that time Bouley was the definitive gold standard of new French restaurants in NY. Â I had the chance to eat at the new Bouley (on West Broadway) one Thanksgiving Holiday a few years ago and unfortunately was extremely underwhelmed. Â Perhaps it was because Mr. Bouley was not in the kitchen that night--but after so much astonoshing praise the experience post Duane Street left a lot to be desired.",-1
4097,490,3,3/26/2007,"Took my husband here for a special occasion years ago, and was totally disappointed with our $300 meal. The food was really too rich - and I like rich, decadent food! There was so much butter and cream in everything, we both felt a bit icky after the meal. I blame them for it, because we ordered the tasting menu with matching wine - so it's not like we picked out every creamy, buttery dish on the menu. Every item on the tasting menu was just cream, cream, cream, butter, butter, lard. Â I felt like gagging by the time they brought out the after-dinner chocolates and sent us off with the little bag of buttery cookies. Might as well stay at home and eat a stick of butter. Plus, I should point out that Daniel Bouley supplied firefighters and volunteer workers with coffee/food after September 11 - ostensibly for free. Then turned around and charged the city for ""volunteering"" his resources. I won't go again just out of principle.",-1
4098,490,4,10/15/2014,"Absolutely charming! Bouley offers a beautiful setting and world-class service for that special meal...the tasting menu was perfect for a graduation lunch with the family. The wine (was a red from Languedoc) was supremely good. The service was great - they even accommodated my request to order a dish from the Prix Fixe menu as an a la carte dish - the Rouget with Iranian Saffron Risotto. Then came the Halibut which was almost overwhelming rich, but oh-so tender and perfectly cooked. Until again, when I am in the mood... I hope to dine at Bouley again... I will try the pre-fix lunch as suggested by previous reviews.",-1
4099,490,4,10/4/2014,"Quality food and nice presentation. Â  Excellent service. Â Loses a star for two things. Â  Â One, while the experience on the whole is just fine, it's not memorable in the way a high end restaurant should be, e.g. Jean Georges and Daniel. Â  Second, for a downtown middle of nowhere off the beaten track restaurant like this to require jackets for men is quite ostentatious and a bit snooty.",-1
2079,490,4,8/24/2014,"A very nice, friendly and exclusive restaurant, definitely worth the trip down to the south of Manhattan. The food was very good and had nice presentation. The service staff really worked hard to give you a top service experience and they succeeded. The sommelier was very good and had a humble approach in a positive way. The wine list was really nice. I rate it 7 out of 10. (7/10) If you wanna experience a perfect love couple dinner this is the place.",-1
4100,490,4,8/12/2014,"This is one of the nicest looking rooms in the city, food and service are top notch, only problem is it can get to hectic as far as flavors with the dishes sometimes",-1

4102,490,4,4/10/2014,"I went to Bouley for lunch with 3 others in August and the experience was fantastic. Â  I had experience the original Bouley a few years back and the memories were still vibrant and strong, so we decided to try the fix price lunch. Â  Â  There wasn't a dish that I didn't like as we were trading bites, but what stood out the most was the porcini flan dish. Â  It was totally worth the money and you got a lot of quality and value for it. Lastly, the service people were amazing, everything was done timely and like a fine tuned machine. Â  I will be going back shortly.",-1
2590,490,4,4/1/2014,"Food was good. But for the price I would go with 11 Madison Park which is more creative and impressive. The mushroom was fantastic. For starters, don't like the overuse of fruits. The main course and dessert were good, but no wow elements.",-1
4103,490,4,3/21/2014,"Just so we'll be absolutely clear about it: A couple will pay at least 350$ in the evening. We never had a dinner that expensive.

4106,490,4,12/25/2013,"My girlfriend and I tried the lunch tasting menu on the other day. She loved the classic decor of the place. The presentation of the dishes was very nice. We ordered big eye tuna (so good) and blini, and porcini flan Â and cod for the second course. My girl said the flan made her nearly ecstatic. My cod was alright. We had the duck and beef cheek for the main course, which were not as impressive as the first two courses we had. The rest was just desserts, which I didn't understand why we have two desserts per person. I would rather have one more amuse than extra dessert. All in all, it was a great deal and we enjoyed the meal.",-1
4107,490,4,11/22/2013,Food was good but I think very pricey. I'm glad I was out on a date. He also had to make reservations which is not the best when you want to be spontaneous. And don't for get to tell them if you want your food mild if not they will bring it very spicy. Overall if you want cheaper indian food and you want to be spontaneous maybe this is not the place for you.,-1
4108,490,4,10/6/2013,"It's hard to beat this spot for the tasting menu alone. Â Awesome service and intelligent sommeliers abound. Â  Super Expensive Sea Urchin and Lamb abound Five Courses, for me!",-1
4109,490,4,6/25/2013,It may seem a bit pricey but the food you are getting... it is worth it. Very delicious french cuisine and a great atmosphere.,-1
4110,490,4,6/17/2013,I recently made a few friends who came over from France and now live in New York. They told me about this place and their french cuisine... it was great. I never really tried french food till I came here and I'm glad I did. A wonderful first experience.,-1

4112,490,4,11/26/2012,We recently had lunch at Bouley with friends and the food was great. We chose to do the pre-fix lunch menu they offer. Â My salmon was delicious as it was flaky and seasoned well without that fishy smell and taste that sometimes you can experience. I had the chocolate cake for dessert and that was such a treat. My only down side was it took them a while to get us our food; the wait staff was a bit slow and perhaps the kitchen was backed up so that's why I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars. Still I plan on going there again once they change their seasonal lunch menu and offer other options.,-1
4113,490,4,10/2/2012,Great menu. Service deserves a push though,-1

4115,490,4,7/23/2012,We had a group of 50 people. The dinner took 3 hours plus. The food wasn't the usual bouley quality. But I suppose it's hard to serve 50 people.,-1
4116,490,4,6/7/2012,"Bouley does everything well, but nothing truly outstanding. That isn't to say I don't enjoy their food, which I do, but it just means nothing is new, or wowing.

Been here 6 times before and will be returning.",-1
4117,490,4,5/4/2012,"Im not normally a review ""writer"" , but having recently read the review of ""blown engagement"", i had to post. My friends got married at City Hall on Tuesday. A friend recommended Bouley for an early celebration. We arrived only to find the doors locked-dinner didn't start until 5, it was 3:45. Much to our delight, David Bouley himself invited us inside, sent over a trio of Amuse Bouche and we were treated with impeccable service. We would highly recommend not only for the level of culinary expertise but for the four star service we received.",-1
4118,490,4,3/9/2012,"The true essence of country French dining. The lunch--try the prix fixe--remains such a good buy and the breadall by itself Â evokes why Europeans surpass the states in this category (for the most part.) Also try Bouley Upstairs at 130 W. Broadway, good all around.",-1
4119,490,4,2/7/2012,"Just had a wonderdul dinner at Bouley. The food is spectacular. The prix fixe is a great value. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, with wonderful soft lighting. Â I would definitely recommend Bouley to others with confidence.",-1
2076,490,4,2/6/2012,"I came here for a first date on a Friday night. The moment you walk in you are hit with the smell of apples from the coat room as there are apples lining the walls. It was nice, my date was a bit late so I got to sit in the front room to wait. The crowd in that area was really old (no offense old people) but it seemed slightly stuffy to me. But when my date arrived and we entered the main restaurant I saw a lot more younger people and it had a bit more energy as well. We had the table near the back that had both seats facing the same direction which always kind of annoys me, especially tonight since my date was lookin so good. The food was delicious, service was amazing and decor was great. I would definitely come back here again, maybe just for a special occasion since it's a bit pricey.",-1

The room itself is one of my very favorite in NYC. However, David Bouley needs to return to creating cuisine. His menu is somewhat tired and for a one star Michelin & Â he is out pricing himself w. the $175 tasting menu. Desserts need to be changed...Also there is no bar to relax at pre dinner.",-1

While expensive, well worth it.",-1
4133,490,4,12/18/2009,"I would say that this place is intimidating upon arrival because of the french castle decor, the petite chandeliers and drapes hanging off the ceilings. Â The hostesses are of a model appearance in strict and sleek black and white attire. Â There is a mandatory coat check at the front. Â The crowd is also very in tune with upscale. Dinner reservations are recommended but we were accommodated with a slight wait, enjoying a few very special cocktails of fruit puree and spirits. Â The dinner was what you expect of an upscale restaurant, everything was unique, exquisitely presented, small portions on big plates. Â The service was outstanding and catered to every wish. Â They served off the menu warm up snacks, post dinner palate cleansers and a cookie tray. Â It was an ""experience"" to say the least, and that is what made it all the more special. Â I found the environment really romantic and perfect for a date. Â The bathrooms downstairs were also in a french castle style.

Bouley did not disappoint, we only ordered 3 appetizer's (one upon recommendation) and an entree each but the meal had so many additional courses. The meal started off with an ""amuse bouche"" of two appetizers one that tasted like a strawberry shortcake flavored snow cone and the other a cracker smothered in an amazing sauce (still don't know what it was). They gave us two (one for each of us) of the Porcini Flan (this was the recommended appetizer dish), we also highly recommend it. We also had the North Carolina Pink Shrimp & Cape Cod Sea Scallops. The main courses were amazing too, we had the veal and lobster both were amazing. The dessert was even better, they also gave us an additional dish with dessert. And two additional ""amuse bouche"" within the dessert course (angel cloud, it was frozen goats milk on top of strawberries where the goats milk, the milk evaporated once it entered your mouth and the other being a tower of chocolates and macaroons). The meal, service and ambiance was AMAZING!!!",-1

Can't comment on the drinks, we did not get any other beverages. Everything was explained to us very well. The amount of food was good, not like other fancy places where you leave hungry.

4148,490,5,6/23/2014,"One could not imagine a more perfect restaurant where the decor, service and food all have such attention to detail that it seems unreal. This speaks volumes of the chef's dedication to not just making the food taste divine, but to catering to his client's every nuance so their dining experience is unforgettable. Inexpensive it is not, but that is okay because this is not a restaurant to be taken lightly. You need to dress properly and be prepared for a meal that has more flavors then you thought could really exist. The tasting menu will leave you stunned by what you have enjoyed over the course of several hours and the wine paring option should be a requirement. A+ There is literally not a finer restaurant in New York.",-1
4149,490,5,5/25/2014,"This was by far the most enjoyable meal I have eaten. It is a beautiful, magical restaurant with the kind of food that makes you feel like royalty. The service is impeccable. Yes, it is expensive, but it is so worth it. Â  I wish I could treat all of my favorite people to meals here, so they can understand why I love food so much.",-1
4150,490,5,5/23/2014,We booked Bouley for a celebratory lunch and selected the 'Tasting Menu' with accompanying wines. The tasting menu (and accompanying wines) is extremely good value for money. The food was sumptuous - without exception. A delightful blend of tastes and textures with very well selected wines. The staff were very engaging and totally professional - all working towards a great atmosphere and dining experience. I would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this restaurant to those seeking a superior dining experience in elegant surroundings.,-1
4151,490,5,5/20/2014,"Super worth it! For the 5 course menu, the food is worth spending for! I ordered the smoked salmon for the appetizer which was amazing! Almost every single dish had truffles and it makes that course that much better. I hope you all will give it a try.",-1

4153,490,5,4/14/2014,"Easiest review ever. The ambiance, service, food, smells, sights, other patrons.... this restaurant is truly transforming. There is simply nothing like it anywhere. My husband and I celebrated our 29th Anniversary at Bouley. Our former favorite was a very special french bistro on the coast in Mendocino. The bar was set very high. The wall of apples, tasting menu, velvet frames, cheese plate, Riesling...Bouley cleared it with no effort at all. Thank you Bouley - now we have a new favorite.",-1
4154,490,5,4/6/2014,"Fantastic! Very expensive, tho. Prix fixe is definitely worth it.",-1
3665,490,5,4/6/2014,"Everything was so perfect. The place is amazing, the service is great and the food unbelievable. The restaurant is specifically dedicated to private or corporate events. The kitchen is open to the dining room and you see the cooks working. The room is full of herbs that they use to cook. The Chef came to say hi ! And to share his approach. Great place.",-1
4155,490,5,4/4/2014,One of the best high end restaurants in the city. Staff is friendly Â  Â Service is excellent Food is good Â and the place is cozy. Â Feels like home. Been here a few times and i always have a great experience,-1
4156,490,5,4/1/2014,"Incredible decor- and great service. The food is so so so pricey, and honestly, if you're a picky eater (like semi-kosher, no-shellfish), it can be hard to choose from their menu... but it's all delicious and a cool experience.",-1
4157,490,5,3/30/2014,"If I were to list all my favorite dishes, I'd write a book. I have had three unbelievable experiences here so far. The atmosphere, the service, the food.....oh! The food! I always order the tasting menus. To me it's the best Bouley experience. Allow a few hours for this event: it's exactly that...as if they prepare the evening just for you.",-1
4158,490,5,3/25/2014,"We ate at Bouley for our 5th anniversary and it was by far, the most amazing dinner we had ever had. We both had their tasting menu with the wine pairing and the food, wine, and service was incredible! (and we are both avid cooks ourselves!) Our servers gave us a special dessert and 6th course (for free) for our anniversary. It was well worth the money, our hats off to Mr. David Bouley!",-1
4159,490,5,3/23/2014,"We loved our experience at Bouley. The restaurant is beautifully designed, with just the perfect degree of intimacy. The menu was exciting - the food gorgeous and delicious. The service level was first class - friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. We were absolutely pleased with our experience. It is quite rare when the hype matches the reality! This is definitely the case with Bouley - it knocked our socks off!",-1
4160,490,5,3/23/2014,Start saving now. Make reservations. The atmosphere hints at European but is so comfortable. Ask for the booth facing the door so you can people watch. The bakery is next stuff your pockets with the bread but not your face. Leave room for everything & demurely lick your plate. The service is as memorable as the food. I have eaten at many wonderful New York restaurants and this is the best. The food is farm to fork fresh and prepared with creativity and delicacy. Do lunch; then you can continue to savor the flavors all day.,-1
4161,490,5,3/22/2014,"I've been fortunate enough to eat at Bouley 4 times in the last year and I've been impressed every single time. I've had the lunch tasting menu each time but have played around a bit with different things to order. I suggest ordering the smoked salmon blini, the kobe beef cheeks, and the chocolate souffle. I also LOVE the selection of breads here! Don't be afraid to chat to the guy who brings the bread cart around - he's super knowledgable and will basically let you try every single piece of bread if you ask. The first time I went here I only got one piece but the last few times I've gotten 3 or 4 - definitely worth it!",-1
4162,490,5,3/21/2014,"I have nothing more to say than go for lunch and get the tasting menu. The restaurant sells itself. Talk to George, he's been there forever, and listen to his recommendations. He will make you feel more than welcome. It's all small plates with wonderful flavors, textures, etc. A must is the crab/porcini flan for the second course. Save room for the breads and deserts.",-1
4163,490,5,3/19/2014,"I dined here last December for my birthday and it was excellent. There were 8 other people, and about half of us were vegetarian, and they did an excellent job accommodating our restrictions. We did the lunch tasting menu, and again, everything was very, very good. It's so difficult to find different, inventive vegetarian food, and Bouley really hit the spot. We dined in the basement, which wasn't as nice at it is upstairs. Decorations were pretty spare, and the noise level was so low because there were so few diners there that the nine of us felt pretty awkward talking at normal conversational levels. As we left, the upstairs level was quite bustling, so I think it was just the basement. The Peach soup pre-dessert was the most phenomenal thing I have ever tasted (and quite frankly, was better than the actual desert). Random Tip: For upscale restaurant newbies like my friends and I, when they give you the options for water, there's a $7/bottle charge (we drank about 9 bottles worth), if you ask for bottled water. Of course, in hindsight, it was silly to assume that there wouldn't be a charge, but I guess we just weren't as mindful as we should have been!",-1
4164,490,5,2/25/2014,"Sublime. The ambiance is castle like, with warm paintings, a library feel in one part. Â Staff is incredibly attentive. Â The food and wine was amazing. Â One of the best dining experience ever. Â Not cheap.",-1

4166,490,5,2/23/2014,"Have now been here 3 more times for lunch with my girlfriend and consistently come away feeling that each meal is exceptional. Â We just brought my sister and her husband to Bouley this past weekend and they both said it was the best meal in their entire life. Â It's not just the food, but the friendly, non-stuffy service. Â I want to particularly single out George, who is warm, witty, helpful and always makes me feel like he's got our gastronomical ""back"".",-1
4167,490,5,2/22/2014,"Bouley is one of my favorite restaurants, ever. The tasting menu is incredible. The dining area is very cool and super inviting and you feel intimate at once. Â  It feels comfortable and also elegant with candles and asian rugs strewn about. The luncheon tasting menu is fantastic with five divine courses of fancy, delicate French cuisine for $55. I highly recommend the foie gras, Â and duck as they are some of the best dishes I've ever eaten. It's truly an incredible culinary affair, so allot yourself at least two hours to thoroughly enjoy your fine dining experience. Â I definitely am looking forward to another delightful visit",-1
4168,490,5,2/21/2014,"We celebrated our anniversary here and will not soon forget the special night that we had at Bouley. From the beginning while we waited for our table until dessert, they were attentive and knew that this was a special night for us. THe food was spectacular and the wines picked by our sommelier were a perfect match. we will return soon and hope that our friends will too, this is a very special place, top of the top!",-1

I can't say enough about how the staff enhanced the experience. They were just wonderful. I was running late and called to ask the staff to take care of my guests. They seated my guests and took care of them until I arrived. They get all stars for being so nice. The food is great, the decor is fabulous.",-1
4171,490,5,1/26/2014,The dining experience here is absolutely what you would expect from a world class 5 star restaurant. Â The apple scent upon entry is delicious. Â The restaurant is beautiful with nice domed. Food and atmosphere are amazing. Unique experience. Overall a great experience. We were seated in the lower floor so it was very quiet and the room wasn't filled at any point when we were there. We were definitely the largest party.,-1
4172,490,5,1/23/2014,"Chef Bouley is back and at his best. From the moment you enter the apple filled entrance, your senses are treated to a feast you will never forget. Besides being on of the most beautiful restaurants, it is the most creative and delicious. Your dining experience at Bouley will not only please your palate but touch your heart and soul. By the way, the pre fixe lunch special @$39 is hands down the best and most delicious bargain in NYC.",-1
4173,490,5,1/18/2014,Hands Down. Truffle Dashi a must try.,-1
4174,490,5,12/31/2013,"I don't know why it took me so long to write this review when Bouley was one of the best dining experiences. Though the food was excellent, onus for the overall experience goes to our chief attendant- Nicolas Corior! Thank you for such excellent service and for taking us to meet chef David Bouley. We will highly recommend the Tasting menu; everything was cooked to perfection (Porcini Flan was phenomenal). The bread trolly was awesome; while the olive bread was my fiance's favorite, I couldn't get enough of the apricot bread. Desserts were fabulous too, especially the complimentary one made of frothy chocolate (sorry can't remember the name). Decor is very intimate and romantic but that shouldn't stop families and big groups from a 5 star dining experience. Entrance is wonderfully decorated with shelves of apples and the ladies restroom is quite interesting as well. Â Bouley is definitely going to be our restaurant to celebrate special occasions.",-1
4175,490,5,12/30/2013,"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary with a special Friday afternoon lunch at Bouley in early November. It was truly an experience to remember. We selected the tasting menu with the wine pairing. The food was absolutely delicious and we enjoyed the special wine selections. I enjoyed not only the taste of all of the dishes, but the presentation as well. In addition to the 5 courses, there were several surprise courses added along the way. And the bread cart--wow! Over 10 choices of delicious, homemade bread. The restaurant is gorgeous; our table looked out at a painting of lavender fields, which brought back memories of a trip to France. In addition to the food and wine, the service is truly outstanding--attentive, without being overbearing, and attuned to every need. They were very accommodating of my dietary restrictions and were careful not to serve anything I couldn't eat. Even though it was lunch, we were so full when we left that we didn't eat until the next day. And they surprised us with a special ""happy anniversary"" message at dessert--such a perfect end to a wonderful afternoon. We will cherish the memory of that meal and experience for a long time.",-1
4176,490,5,12/4/2013,"Went here for a special occasion dinner, and boy they did not disappoint. First of all, I felt like I was dining in a chic Versailles, the furnishings are elegant - but they manage to keep it comfortable. Not snooty at all. Started off with a La Fleur cocktail - equally elegant. We indulged in the porcini flan, shrimp & sea scallops, black sea bass, and duck - all amazing. Homemade bread a great touch. The service was off the hook - just a great evening from start to finish. Yes, pricey. But not out of line with higher end in NYC and definitely a cut above on the details.",-1
4177,490,5,12/2/2013,"Food - excellent, service - excellent",-1
4178,490,5,11/12/2013,"Bouley is great. It's so underrated it's unbelievable. The food here is excellent and like some other reviewers have said up there with the greats in city, making it one of the best in the world. No, that's not hyperbole. Before I forget to mention it they bake their bread on site. Not a lot of restaurants do that, even the greats! This just goes to show the top quality of the input from the chefs. I am not going to recommend anything on the menu because as often as my girlfriend and I go we have never had a sub-par dish. The ambiance is cossetting, warm and embracing. Sorry I cannot find better words than that to describe it. The waitstaff are also some of the best you can find!",-1
4179,490,5,11/7/2013,"Came here a couple of weekends ago for my sister's 30th birthday. Â I was worried I would struggle getting a table for 5 on a Saturday night in Manhattan (and I did), but Bouley managed to squeeze us in at 10:30 - not too late a sitting when you've got an awesome cocktail bar down the road (Brandy Library - amazing!). Â Staff was incredible, gorgeous cocktails and wine, and the food was beyond superb! Â Best meal I've had in perhaps ever! Â Will be going back again for my birthday!",-1
4180,490,5,11/5/2013,One of my favorites. Amazing restaurant in a beautiful building. French but not stuffy.,-1
4181,490,5,11/4/2013,"Visited early prior to a show. Service was top notch, the wine recommendations and pairing were excellent without breaking the bank and the food was flavourful and cooked to perfection. We were planning a light meal by sharing an appetizer and a desert with one entreÃ© each but with the chariot de pain, amuse bouche and other extras including a complimentary dessert and a parting gift of a large individual lemon loaf our hunger was well satisfied. The duck and sea bass entrÃ©es were cooked to perfection. Highly recommended!",-1
4182,490,5,11/3/2013,"Since 2009, Bouley has improved dramatically. David Bouley seems to have refined his menu/s and zeroed on the dishes that not only explode with flavor but are also healthy. His artistry begins with the incredible rolls. Then the apricot walnut bread is to die for, not to mention the fig bread and the dried cherry bread. He seems to be using more organic ingredients. Last visit for example, one of our two desserts on the $55.00 five course lunch tasting menu, organic strawberries in an ameretto mousse which was amazing. The duck was melt the mouth delicious. The porcini mushroom flan was loaded with crabmeat and better than ever. The oysters tasted of caught ten minutes ago freshness. And the chocolate souffle was its usual amazing self. This meal coupled with our amazing Christmas Day lunch in 2011 prompted me to pump them up to five stars, but the service which was spectacular on Christmas Day 2011 left alot to be desired at lunch a couple of weeks ago.",-1
4183,490,5,10/7/2013,"Food was delicious. Had the chef's selection with the wine accompaniment and both my date and myself left overly full . We both enjoyed the food very much. The service was stellar, can't say enough about the staff. Ambiance was warm, romantic, and inviting. Perfect for a special occasion!",-1
4184,490,5,10/1/2013,Excellent! One of the best places to bring a date.. was there for lunch today. excellent!,-1
4185,490,5,9/22/2013,"We recently celebrated our anniversary at Bouley. Â Course after course, the food was creative and delicious, beautifully prepared and presented. Â From the moment we walked in the door until we were finished, we were cared for by an extraordinarily attentive and friendly staff. Â The restaurant is lovely and comfortable. Â  This is an evening we will remember fondly for years to come.",-1
4186,490,5,9/13/2013,"Bouley provides a fine dining experience worthy of the most special of occasions. Every course was delicious, the service was impeccable and the sommelier provided several wines that paired well with our meals.",-1
4187,490,5,9/7/2013,"If asked for a restaurant recommendation, Bouley is almost always one of the recommendations I will give. Â When you first walk into the restaurant, you are greeted by a small room with fresh apples lining the walls. Â The aroma is just fantastic--I could spend an hour just sitting there taking it in. Â The restaurant itself is a very quaint, well decorated space. Â It probably borders a little bit on the stuffy side, especially since jackets are required here, but I will easily forgive that shortcoming for the quality of the food. Â  Oh, the food--definitely among the best I have ever had. Â Whether it is the peach soup, the wild mushrooms, the very famous porcini flan, or the Long Island duck, each dish at this restaurant brings out the most unique flavors of the ingredients and highlights them on your palette. Â In the middle of your meal, a cart with around 7 types of different artisan breads will roll around and deliver to you slices from whichever ones you want to try. Â I found the garlic and fig breads to both be very delicious. Â And at the end of your meal, after your dessert, they will bring a little tower of confections to your table as a nice way to end your meal. Â On your way out, you may also get a loaf or two of fresh pound cake for the road! Â Everything I have had at Bouley in my two visits here has been absolutely amazing--words do not do it justice. Almost equally as good as the food Bouley offers is the value they offer. Â Lunch prix fixe is only $55 for a 5 course meal (5 courses outside of the bread and confections). Â Of course dinner is much more expensive, but that just makes it in line with other restaurants of its caliber. Â I like to recommend this place to friends who need to take a larger group to a nice meal b/c it doesn't break the bank and the food is really just amazing. Â I highly recommend Bouley and look forward to returning yet again in the future.",-1
4188,490,5,9/4/2013,"Been visiting this place more or less regularly for over 10 years. The food is always great, sometimes simply excellent. In that sense it's probably the best upscale restaurant in NYC. The price-quality ratio also seems to be fair.",-1
4189,490,5,8/7/2013,Bouley is truly a treat. Come here for a special occasion and you won't be disappointed. Keep in mind it is VERY formal here,-1
4190,490,5,7/29/2013,"Mango and passion fruit dome with rosemary and white coffee ice cream Â - It's amazing how much wonderful flavors can be incorporated into a dessert. Perfectly cooked and flaky, the cod was the highlight of the meal.), organic buckwheat, & ginger sauce; slow braised Kobe beef cheeks w/ ricotta gnocchi and blue kale delicious. Cleanliness: Very nice. Â It was very nice looking, eloquent, and luxurious.",-1
4191,490,5,7/26/2013,"Lunch can be easier to get reservations! A beautiful meal from beginning to end! Had the Tasting Menu and it was fabulous. One of the best meals ever.

You can run up your bill unintentionally by having more water and be sure and ask the price of the glass of champagne they recommend!! The loaf of bread given to us as we left was a welcome surprise!",-1
4192,490,5,7/24/2013,"absolutely stunning! I went there on my birthday and grabbed a nice table by making a reservation two days before the day.

We spilled a glass of wine (the last of our bottle) and the sommelier soon brought us each a complimentary glass. That was a nice touch! The food was spectacular!

4200,490,5,6/6/2013,I'm not a shill or someone given to over the top reviews. But lunch at Bouley today was my best meal in NYC ever. Â I've entertained clients over the last 10 yrs at the best restaurants in town. Sublime. I'm mystified that this has received under five stars by other reviewers.,-1
4201,490,5,4/4/2013,My husband and I went for lunch today. We were seated in the lower level which was beautiful and much more intimate than upstairs. Entering the restaurant you are greeted with wonderful smells of apples that lined the walls of the foyer. The waitstaff was very attentive and were not overbearing. We had the tasting menu and it was lovely. I would definitely recommend Bouley.,-1
4202,490,5,3/16/2013,"I wend to this restaurant a few months back with family. It was an overall excellent experience: from the service to the food, even the waiting area was unique with the rows of apples (which everyone seem to mention in their reviews as well). The choices for artisan bread complemented the excellent tasting menu. I definitely recommend choosing the flan, even if a supplement will be necessary. Though the prohibitive price makes the restaurant somewhat harder to approach, the satisfaction from eating at such a dressy place is unparalleled. I always use to say, you can truly tell how good a restaurant is by the quality of its bathroom, and this one definitely earns 5 stars.",-1
4203,490,5,12/24/2012,"Wonderful food (the six course tasting menu is fantastic for dinner!), the best wine I've ever had thanks to one of the best sommeliers at any restaurant I've ever visited, the most comfortable and beautiful room, and friendly and efficient service add up to one of the best restaurant experiences of my life. I've dined at anywhere from Per Se to Jean-Georges to Daniel to Le Bernardin, and Bouley is definitely in my top 3 restaurants. I always feel so comfortable and welcomed here, the food is consistently excellent (if not quite at the level of Jean-Georges), and the room feels like I've been transported to some crazy French chateau. Bathrooms are super fancy, too. I make sure to visit the men's room here at least three times just to take advantage.If you're looking to eat one of the best meals of your life and be treated like a king for two and a half hours, look no further than this unlabeled wonderland on Hudson and Reade.",-1

We are spanish speakers so they send us a spanish waitress... The ambience is really elegant.

4208,490,5,10/11/2012,After reading all the great reviews on Yelp. I decided to try this restaurant with my best friend last week. This place is absolutely amazing and satisfying. You walk into the dining room and it is another world. Â Time flows slowly and leisurely. Â The glass of Bordeaux blanc recommended by the staff set the wonderful tone. Â The bread was perfect. Â I had Porcini Flan to start with. Â The crab was so tender and the dashi broth went perfectly with the crab. Â I could not have enough of it. Â For entree I had the duck. Â It was the most tender and soft duck I ever had. Â The source was refined and I loved the hint of yuzu flavor. Â After the entree was complimentary ricotta cheese sorbet in melon juice. Â The combination of the cold and mild ricotta cheese and the room temperature melon juice was absolutely heavenly. Â Everything about the meal was simply perfect. It was definitely one of the best dining experience.,-1
4209,490,5,9/4/2012,"The staff are outstanding - courteous and pleasant. Always keeping an eye out for when they are needed, but never intrusive. The decor is cozy, elegant and lush. Dramatic ceilings, rich fabrics, deep colors - I immediately felt comfortable and content in my surroundings. We went for the 5 course lunch tasting menu. Everything was delicious and promptly served. In particular the black cod, the salmon, and even something as simple as a Boston Bibb salad were exquisitely prepared. The bread service was a novel and tasty treat. The attention to detail about everything was top notch, nothing was overlooked.

4211,490,5,3/18/2012,"My friend Cici and I love a great deal, so we decided to go for the $55 prix-fixe 5 course lunch at Bouley today. The restaurant was beautiful, with fresh flowers everywhere. Â Cici commented that the waiters were serving like a well-rehearsed symphony. Once in awhile, you would get a whiff of truffles. The lunch started with an amuse bouche: pumpkin soup with candied pine nuts. It reminded me of the soup I used to buy at the now closed Bouley Market. The soup was so creamy and pumpkin-y that I wished Bouley Market is still open. For our first course, we both chose the Carpaccio Of Kampachi, Young Blue Fin Tuna And Striped Amber Jack prepared in a mediterranean manne. Â The plate was so pretty, it looked like fish swimming in a pool of pretty green flowers. Â The carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh with the most wonderful sauces. We were fascinated by the guy wheeling around the bread in a cart like one of those dim sum ladies. He was so into methodically cutting the bread that he belonged in a movie about Bouley, or bread, or just any movie. He suggested the Saffron walnut bread with the porcini flan. I also tried the apricot walnut bread (sweet, chewy and fresh) and olive bread. I still think Del Posto has the best bread in the city though. The second course was the famous Porcini Flan with Alaska Live Dungeness Crab black truffle dashi in its own little pot. Â I can see why so many people recommend the flan. The crab meat was outrageously crabby and fresh. Â I believe this dish is what makes the air smell like truffles every once in awhile, when someone is served the porcini flan and they open the little pot and let the aroma envelop them (an apparently everyone else) in a cloud of truffle bliss. For the third course, Cici picked the All-Natural Pennsylvania Chicken with carrot ravioli, chanterelles, pain d'empics dressing and I picked the Slow Braised Kobe Style Beef Cheeks with blue kale gnocchi. Â  Cici gave me a bite of her chicken and carrot ravioli. This was not the usual frozen chicken you get at other restaurants. I want, no NEED, the secret of how they make the chicken so tender. Â Is it because it's all natural or from Pennsylvania? Â We need to know. This chicken was so tender, it makes other so called ""chicken tenders"" taste like leather (Cici said ""old shoe"" but I'm not as gross as her). Â ""They are like chicken meltaways!"" Cici later texted me as she finished her chicken that she took home in a doggie bag (more on that later). Â  Also, the carrot raviloli was so sweet and the pasta delectible, it tasted like pumpkin. Â (Before this, my only other taste of a sweet vegetable ravioli are the butternut squash raviolis at Costco. Â This aint no Costco ravioli, people! Â I am not a snob, I just like good food.) Â  The beef was delicious as well, with gnocchi on the bottom, but by then I was too full to fully appreciate the beef, however yummy it was. Next, came a palate cleanser of Honey Tangerine Soup with sancho pepper, lychee sorbet, crystallized honey. Â Very refreshing and perfect after all the courses. We both picked the Hot Caramilized Anjou Pear,valrhona chocolate, biscuit breton, hot toffee sauce, lemon verbena and tahitian vanilla ice creams for dessert. Â I did not like the lemon verbena ice cream too much, reminded me of Lemon Pledge. Â Sorry. Â The chef provided us an extra dessert: bulgur wheat ice cream. It was a unique taste, creamy and kind of salty. The chef also presented some complimentary, gorgeous little macarons, wafer thin cookies, chocolates and nut crunch. Â  We did not finish our desserts so we asked for doggie bags. The server who cleared the table acted like this was an unusual request. Yes, we are Hoi polloi. Â We take doggie bags. We are not on a date and we don't care. Plus, it's a Michelin Star doggie bag. If you think we are declasse for asking for doggie bags, witness what happened at the next table: The two guys next to us (not in jackets, as required by the restaurant rules) obviously tourists due to the hotel room key card on the table (see, no little detail escapes me, a skill I honed after watching almost all the Monk reruns), sat down later than us, so by the time their table was cleared for dessert, we were done with our meal. Â One of the guys (with an accent) asked for *gasp* more bread. Â The server said incredulously, ""More bread, with DESSERT?"" Â Amateurs. Â Tourists. Â Didn't they know that we New Yawkers don't eat bread with dessert? Â Suddenly, it was as if the perfect symphony came to a screeching halt for a second. Â The bread guy was notified of the request, and he went over and asked which bread they would like to enjoy some more. Â They chose the apricot walnut (good choice). Â Bread Guy said, ""Let me get you a plate, would you like butter with that?"" Â Then all was well again as the two bread-loving gentlemen were served their desserts. Â The doggie bags were discreetly given to us by the receptionist/coat check girl. Â Go to my blog for more of this review.",-1
4212,490,5,3/3/2012,"Bouley is a very fine dining experience. Â Luckily, I was just here again for a friend's birthday. It's expensive and beautiful and it delivers the goods.

I will just have to sell my apartment.",-1
4213,490,5,2/22/2012,"This place is unbelievable! Â My husband and I love eating out and this has been our absolute stand out so far!

4214,490,5,2/13/2012,"Five of us had a marvelous lunch at Bouley on Saturday, Feb 11. Â The interior design transported me to another beautiful world. Â Everywhere I looked there was something to see, from carved antique doors and fruit-themed chandeliers to huge floral bouquets and lovely drapery. Â The French sommelier charmingly picked out a reasonably priced wine for us from the rather intimidating wine binder. Â  Our waiter knew all the details about our food and even told us how to make the salad dressing at home. Â I ordered the salad with Bibb lettuce, watercress, hearts of palm and mushrooms. Â It was superb. Â All the china is unique and beautiful. Â I was so tempted to flip the pieces over and read the bottoms. Â I ordered the porcini flan with Dungeness crab which was also perfect. Â My entree was chicken with vegetables. Â By that time, however, I had eaten too much of the bread. One server pushed around a bread cart with 6 different wonderful breads to try and I overdid it. Dessert was sublime--a hot caramelized pear with toffee sauce and ice cream. Â  I felt like I was having lunch in a welcoming, elegant home. Â Our group of five people had cocktails, a bottle of wine and the full 5-course tasting menu. Â It came to $110 a person including a 20% tip. Â The lunch was worth every penny. Â Absolutely loved it. Â  I'm from San Francisco and my friends can be kind of snarky and find faults with lots of things. Aside from the busgirl who was rather dreary and bored, we found not one fault at Bouley. P.S. Don't know if I would have wanted to sit in the downstairs eating area as much.",-1

I know what I like and what I don't. I've even decided to use the GI Bill to go to culinary school because I care about the experience of sharing a meal so much. This dinner tonight marked the first year of my marriage. I can honestly say that when this restaurant is in prime form (which it was tonight) that there is no better experience in the world. The staff danced, the meals surprised and delivered. The extra mile was afforded by all, and my wife and I are as happy as we have ever been. I recommend this special experience with the highest marks possible.",-1

Â The food was flawless... our table was lovely ... and the service was very good. Â We had some dietary restrictions, and they were very accommodating. Â As I was celebrating my birthday, they were extra kind to us and treated us to several additional courses and desserts that were unexpected surprises. Â  By the time we finished our three hour lunch, we felt as if we had been on a mini vacation. Â Thanks Bouley for a wonderful experience and a fabulous value for lunch.",-1
4218,490,5,9/8/2011,"We spent our wedding anniversary at Bouley 3 years ago. So sorry I'm writing a review now! This was my second time, and hubby's first. I had the pleasure of having dinner at Bouley with coworkers and clients when I was dating hubby, and he was so jealous! I really don't have anything to add to how fantastic the $175 tasting menu was. They kept feeding us with wonderful cookies and dessert just because it was our wedding anniversary until we were so full and needed a break! One thing I remember was I was on my way to the ladies' room, and the head waiter stopped the traffic in the hallway for me so that I could make it safely to the bathroom. His gesture made me feel like a queen! I ordered a book written by Danny Meyer for a friend today who wants to start a restaurant. DM opened Shake Shack, restaurants at the Museum of Modern Art, restaurants that haven been around so long, they became institutions. DM talks about how the service is so important. I'm pretty sure the service at Bouley is what separates it from other restaurants in addition to the fantastic dishes it serves.",-1

4225,490,5,12/11/2010,"The ultimate sensual experience. I have been going to Bouley for a decade now, and the chef's recent decision to focus on the main restaurant and close the others in Tribeca has paid off. Bouley has improved and innovated, and the service is better than ever -- unobtrusive, intelligent. The decor plays delightfully -- Â something of Morocco, paintings opening onto Provence landscapes -- bringing a deep relaxation in which you taste a succession of almost dreamlike dishes. The contrasts of citrus risotto and Japanese sardines, the Russian caviar on the oysters, the fallow venison with micro-Brussels sprouts and rutabaga puree, the caramelized pear -- everything inventive, new, perfect. The bill is reasonable compared with a flight to the Mediterranean (and no jet lag!).",-1

4241,490,5,12/31/2014,"This 5 star review is for lunch only since the $55, 5 course prefix is such a great deal. Â Regardless of the price, if the experience is the same for dinner, I would give 4 stars. This was our first time at Bouley. Â As you enter the front door of the restaurant, the fragrance of apples hit you. What a way to get your senses started. Then you enter the dining room... BREAD!!! Â The aroma of fresh baked bread as you enter says comfort. Â The ambiance is romantic, cozy and had beautiful lighting of candles. Â Great for dates. The stones and barrel ceiling reminded me of Tuscany. Some may not like it because it is formal. (Fyi, men must wear a jacket). The service was attentive but not obstructive. The restaurant is a bit small in comparison to similar fine dining restaurants in Manhattan, so we felt a bit rushed even though the meal took three hours. Now for the food... Porcini flan with Dungeness crab in black truffle dashi was delightful. Â The Blue Fin tuna with Yuzu sauce was one of the best I've had. Forager's treasure of wild mushrooms was very good, but the grilled Toro in the dish did not complement the earthiness of the mushrooms. Â  When the bread man comes around... restrain yourself from wanting to eat everything on the cart. The varieties are endless. My favorite was the walnut with apricot. The main course: the chicken was moist and simple and yet I could not stop eating it. The beef cheeks melted in my mouth and so did the gnocchi. Â The chilled coconut soup was the perfect palate cleanser before our desserts. My memory of the desserts are just - whatever. However the complementary tower of treats with chocolates and sesame hearts ... so good.",1

Always go with the signature course, that is, the flan, the mushroom, as well as the duck. strongly recommend the flan, crab meat was a perfect match with the soup. Someone on the review was saying that it was a bit plain, I'd say it's just about the right level of savory, so go for it!

Â The shrimp and scallop appetizer was good, but nothing amazing. Â We had two bites from the chef. Â One was a wonderful cracker with some truffled...something on it. Â Very good. Â But the vanilla scented oyster shell literally tasted like play-dough. Then came the entrees. Â I should not have gotten the Colorado Lamb. Â If entrees are to be dainty, as required by ""fine dining"" rules, then every bite should be amazing. Â The one piece of ""rack"" in the center was ok. Â But it was so thin and so small, that it just didn't have the depth of flavor you want from a well cooked piece of lamb. Â The same could be said for the 3 or 4 small pieces of loin. Â 5 bites and the entree was done. Â And the potato puree literally tasted like instant mashed potatoes. Â Terrible. Â The Chilean Sea Bass that my wife had was good, but nothing amazing.

4252,490,5,12/10/2014,"I am sooo excited to give my first 5 star review. I absolutely adore this place. A modern French fine dining restaurant with a Japanese twist to it. It was an exceptional experience here. You definitely have to go for their 6 course prefix menu as each course is made with perfection. I took my fiancÃ© here for his birthday this year. Â Ordered the prefix that consists of 2-3choices from each course therefore him and I chose a different dish to get an overall experience. Although his dishes came out better than mine (not a taste issue) -he just happened to pick the more delicious one. Food was impeccable and I cannot stop complimenting their culinary skills enough. We had a porcini flan which was a soup that was made with dashi (Japanese broth) with generous strips of Alaskan crab. Creamy, tasty, addicting.. Best soup in my life! I thought this was going to be the highlight of the night. But wait until you try their New York State Foie Gras! Melts in your mouth!! Every dish was good hence I know I said it Â multiple times. This place also provides awesome service, however the only thing I would recommend is for them to serve the dishes a bit slower. It also happened to be thanksgiving that day, maybe they were busy and needed to flip tables? I mean service was too good that we felt a little bit rushed; before we enjoyed the dish the second came right after the first was taken away. They also serve a wide variety of complimentary bread- a man actually goes around the dining floor with a cart and cuts the bread in front of you. After the courses, as we were more than full, a little surprise came. We got a desert rack of delicate treats which included white, dark chocolate, mini sesame bar & other goodies. It was really a ""Bon Appetit"" for us..REALLY. P.S. If you want to experience this without breaking your pocket you can go for lunch they offer similar dishes less than half the dinner price.",1
4253,490,5,12/7/2014,"Came here for lunch to celebrate my parents' birthdays (which are within a week of each other). Â The entrance displays floor-to-ceiling shelves of apples which envelop you with their fragrance. Â Then you go through a blue room with white lilies on the wall, where the maitre'd greets you. Â There are plush little chairs and a full stocked bar if you arrive early or want a drink before your meal. Â Next there's the main dining room, with stunning decor: curved gold flecked domed ceilings, festive seasonal flowers and red berries in vases, and giant paintings of flowered countrysides. Â We were seated at a table in the middle of the room, but there are also tables along the walls with plush couches where you can sit side-by-side instead of face-to-face. Â  Everyone in our group went with the $55 five course tasting menu. Â We started off with a creative and lovely amuse bouche: a scallop ceviche in a kind of citrus foam, as well as a cracker streaked with a line of caviar. Â This was actually my brother's favorite part of the meal. Â  WARNING: As others have mentioned, the bread cart is insane. Â In addition to the two types of bread you get at the start of the meal (a little baguette and a little soft roll), you also get your choice of over ten varieties of bread from a large cart, wheeled by a gentleman with a devilish smile who will tempt you with all their delicious possibilities. Â STAY STRONG. Â LIMIT YOURSELF TO JUST A FEW. Â ALSO ASK FOR THIN SLICES. Pacing is everything with such a large meal if your stomach is like mine and easily overwhelmed. Â Luckily, with a group of four, we were able to break off little bits of our slices to share with one another. Â My favorites were the garlic, the sourdough, the cherry, and the apricot walnut. Â There are a couple of dense gluten free options. Course #1: My brother and I both went with a sweet corn chowder with carrot puree and comte cheese foam, which was perfect for a winter day--surprisingly light but rich with flavor. Â My parents had the smoked salmon blini, which was a delight for the eyes and a fun combination of textures. Course #2: I picked the ""Organic Connecticut Farm Egg"" in coconut foam with serrano ham, polenta, artichoke. Â I'm an egg lover, and this egg was perfectly prepared with a soft runny center that fulfilled all of my eggy hopes. Â The ham was the perfect accompaniment, the coconut foam...not so much, for me. Â I still enjoyed it very much. Supposedly there was artichoke in there but I didn't really see any physical evidence of it, so maybe it was incorporated into the foam. Â My father went with the porcini flan, which he adored. Â Both my mother and brother had the Forager's Treasure of Wild Mushrooms, which I tasted. Â I liked the mushrooms themselves, but not so much the white foamy sauce that joined them. Â I didn't try the toro which completed this dish. Course #3: My mother and I chose the ""All Natural Pennyslvania Chicken"" which was the best dish of the entire meal for both of us. Somehow,the chicken was incredibly moist, tender, and flavorful, not the dreaded overcooked dried out chicken breast that plagues many a restaurant plate. Â It was encircled by a delicious green sauce, and accompanied by butter beans and fresh tasting brussels sprout leaves, as well as a mashed potato side. Â Despite being pretty full from the first few dishes, we demolished our portions in seconds. Â My father chose his favorite protein, duck, which he appreciated (though he thought our chicken was better). Â It came with a rich, buttery chestnut sauce which I sampled and enjoyed. Â My brother went with the kobe beef cheeks with blue kale gnocchi...I tried them and they were very tender but had a bit of a strange, sour, vinegary taste which he liked, but I didn't as much. Extra course: All four of us got a plate of foie gras drizzled in a rich creamy sauce. Â I couldn't handle more than a few bites at this point (stomach space was rapidly disappearing) but luckily the guys helped me out. Â Those few bites were ridiculously decadent, though. Course #4: Strawberries versus Coconut soup. Â I preferred the strawberries but both were nice. Course #5: Chocolate Souffle versus Hot caramelized Anjou Pear. Â Beautiful presentation for both. Â I had the latter, and it was good but not mind blowing. Â Pear + caramel is usually a slam dunk for me, but this was merely pretty good. Â My brother chose the cheese course instead for a supplement, which he enjoyed. Petit fours: little chocolates and macarons. Â I was done by then, so can't offer any opinion on their taste, but they were pretty in their little display thing. Service was gentle, attentive, impeccable. Â Sommelier was on point. Overall, an insane deal for very high quality food. Â I've had better meals at high end restaurants, but the price + quality + ambiance make Bouley a special experience. Â Come hungry, and stay strong when faced with the bread cart!",1
4254,490,5,12/7/2014,"We were 45 mins late for our Sunday noon reservation. To our pleasant surprise, our table was still kept without issue. We were seated in the basement level (Red room), which turned out to be better than the main level as it's quieter and had more atmosphere due to the low vaulted ceilings in the hallway and the wine cellar. All three of us picked the 55 dollar prix fixe lunch. It's five courses, including an amuse-bouche, a huge bread selection, and an after-meal mini-chocolate selection. Service was excellent - each course was explained upon being served, and plates and utensils were replaced promptly as needed. Memorable appetizers are the Porcini Flan: crab and truffle mixed in a soup, and Treasury of wild mushrooms: assortment of mushrooms laid out in a plate. My entree of Kobe beef cheeks were a bit bland, but my wife's Long Island Duck and mother-in-law's Pennsylvania Chicken were both superb - tender medium-rare duck with a charred skin, and buttery chicken with a texture as smooth as that of fish. The last 2 courses were actually both dessert - one light and one rich .The light ones: ice cream on a bed of strawberries for me and ice cream in a coconut soup for the others, turned out to be better than the rich ones: chocolate souffle and Anjou pear, both of which were too sweet for our Asian taste buds. Overall, I was very impressed with the decor, service, and food of Bouley. The $55 prix fixe lunch is one of the best values in town for upscale dining. PS: Do not drive here unless you need the car to go somewhere else afterwards. We had to add $20 do our total cost as we drove around for 20 mins finding street parking and finally had to park in a garage.",1
4255,490,4,12/3/2014,"My date and I enjoyed the lunch tasting menu here last week. Beautiful, romantic, cozy place. Excellent service, good food, extensive wine list. You will be greeted by a ""wall of apples"" upon entering. The dining area is decorated with an assortment of fresh flowers and massive paintings. Some of the dishes that stood out to me were the big eye tuna, blini of Scottish smoked salmon, Chatham striped bass, and organic Colorado lamb. The dishes that were not as good were the forager's treasure of wild mushrooms and the slow braised Kobe style beef cheeks. The desserts were all lovely. The chocolate assortment provided at the end is the cherry on the sundae. All dishes were beautifully presented and I stress again that the service is top notch. Would love to go back for dinner. Great spot for a special event.",1
4256,490,5,12/3/2014,"Bouley has officially been on my recommended list since I discovered their lunch $55 for 5 course deal. I know there are plenty of fine dining options in the city and you can blow the money and be fancy, with mediocre food and service. That make Bouley stands out with impeccable services, mind-blowing food and you still can walk out from the restaurant with a fat wallet. I chose Bouley to take my Taiwanese friends who were shortly visiting in town to show the glamorous of manhattan fine dinning. Decor:4.5/5 What's the smell? Wow there is an apple wall foyer welcoming customers while walking in. Feeling that you have arrived at a gracious French farm with loyal Baroque red velvet pride. Crystal chandeliers with pears,apples and grapes pendants. You will find your girlfriend lost herself in the powder room taking selfies , or lost herself in the hall way still taking selfie with beautiful wall mirrors. Service: 4.5/5 Impeccable is not enough to describe. , our waitress elaborates to introduce the ingredients, the gentlemen who serves bread cart always walking by to cut some pieces of freshly made bread to customers. Utensils are replaced after every dish. Swiftly fold your napkins if you walk away to the washroom and help you to seat again after you come back. You can feel everyone here work with passion to serve their customers. Food:4.7/5 Amuse bouche - How can a piece of white mouse black truffles canape be so savory? Open up your taste bud and mind, a journey of flavor has begun. Warm porcini flan with Alaska carb and black truffles- great news for those folks hating to take the carb meats with their sharp teeth! Fluffy carb meats with black truffles. Amazing combination that making you feel sad for the last bite. Wild Alaskan salmon - You can chew it slightly and it starts melting in your mouth. Chill coconut soup with coconut ice cream- Love the freshness of coconut and the ice cream is perfectly sweet! At the end of meal, we received a tower of sweets and chocolates in stead of petit four!!! The cute little tower bought my heart right away. One the way out each of us received a big cake as take home gift. Â Bouley. Why you only crowned with one star Michelinï¼ŸI defiantly will take more friends back to visit you.",1
4257,490,5,12/2/2014,Still the best prix fixe lunch deal in town. Go to place for out of town foodie guests.,1
4258,490,5,12/2/2014,"The decor impressed me, as well as some of the courses they served. The amuse bouche and complimentary desserts were tasty as well. Bread was the most impressive! Service was fine.",1
3073,490,5,11/29/2014,"Fashions change. Hip restaurants flicker and fade. But Bouley stands, glamorous and gilded, stalwart and dynamic, indulging in reliably seasonal flavors. It's a place to celebrate the beauty of life and the beauty of food. It's a restaurant to feel soothed and fancy and learn what a flat spoon is for. And guys. There's a separate bread waiter--always smiling--who comes by to offer whatever you'd like of 12+ homemade breads made that day. Make sure to try the fig bread. It was the underestimated favorite. Jackets required.",1
4259,490,5,11/28/2014,"Beautiful decor; great, romantic ambience; and the food was amazing (did the tasting menu - the first couple courses - the flan, egg, oyster, caviar with uni - were the best). Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the city!",1

4262,490,5,11/16/2014,"Solid French food, with everything very well balanced. Everything was very well balanced, with them either serving you something to cleanse your palette for the next dish, or the dishes do not overwhelm your taste buds with each successive course. There is really not much to say, other than to trust the chef here with what you are eating, unless you have ingredients you definitely cannot eat. Â But just follow what they are serving you, and you really will not be disappointed. As for the desserts, you know that everyone knows Bouley for its desserts. Â They will not disappoint you. My only complaint is that the place is a bit stuffy. Â But give me another 10 years, and I might call it ""classy.""",1
4263,490,5,11/16/2014,"This six-star experience began when I decided to dine at Bouley for my birthday. I chose it because it was the number two Zagat-rated restaurant in New York (number one being Le Bernadin, and I'm not a rare fish lover) When I called the restaurant and explained that I wanted a reservation for one person (try that at some other places) the woman was gracious, and when I said it was my birthday she was even more so. This was about two months before the day. Two days before my birthday I received a confirming call, again from a charming woman, looking forward to my arrival. Both times I was politely reminded of the dress code (jackets for men, please). When I got to the restaurant I was immediately relieved of my coat and gloves (it was very cold outside) and ushered into the small waiting area, and offered a cocktail. I waited about ten minutes until a man ushered me downstairs to a small table explaining that this was an additional dining room. The main room upstairs was bright, full, and fairly noisy, while the downstairs room of seven or eight tables was subdued, like a wine cave (except not cold) and very quiet. I could hear myself think, as well as hear all of what I was told. A blustery party of three at the far end of the room refused to be seated there for dinner. Of course that's their right, but frankly I'm glad their negative energy left the room. I selected the tasting menu with wine pairings. I won't say too much about the food because the menu changes regularly, but every course (plus two or three additional ""bonus"" courses) was delicious and totally haute cuisine. The wild mushrooms and an amuse bouche involving tomato gelee and ""snow"" were standouts, along with the ""soft scrambled egg"" bonus dish and the Valhrona chocolate cake, which I was offered along with a tray of sweets, a citrus dessert, and a crazy pineapple ""carpaccio"" birthday offering with a lit candle held inside a raspberry (see other diners' photos for somewhat similar dishes). Other diners commented about the wonderful bread table, which I saw but chose to pass on because I was afraid I wouldn't have room for all of the other food I was being offered. The wine pairings were OUTSTANDING, including a funky 25-year old Vouvray, a Trockenbeerenauslese Chardonnay (yes), and a house of Margaux blend; all were spectacular, and not wines I've encountered anywhere else, poured with panache by Dean the wine steward, who told me more about the wines than I could remember (especially as the glasses mounted up). This was the best wine pairing meal I've ever had. This was the finest solo dining experience I have ever had. I asked to see the manager to pass along my compliments. When he returned (Jacques Le Magueresse, Director of Operations, the man who ushered me in), he graciously accepted my feedback. A few minutes later, Dean invited me to tour the kitchen and meet chef Bouley. Â Unfortunately, the chef was busy marinating lobster tails, but I spent more than ten minutes with General Manager Manuel Enfedaque watching the various stations (so many, many people, and so BIG, and clean and quiet and well-run--chef Bouley is no Gordon Ramsay) and receiving answers to my questions. That might have been the best birthday treat of all. This was not an inexpensive meal. The total with tax and tip was $400, so this is not an everyday dining experience. But I thought it was worth every penny, and I will return to Bouley in a future New York visit. I believe it earns its high place in the Zagat hierarchy. To those who have not had this experience, I cannot understand what may have gone wrong. My dining experience was flawless, and I dine out more than once a week at fine restaurants.",1
1285,490,2,11/15/2014,"Yeah, yeah I am going to get totally yelled at by my family for giving Bouley only 2 stars. Â It is based on my own dishes (bad choices), not their dishes (which were 10 times better). Absolutely amazing, gorgeous atmosphere (and you must check out the ladies room!). I announced for my mom's birthday we all had to order from the lunch tasting menu. Â  Everyone looked shocked but happily obliged. Started out with amuse bouche which was a burst of different flavors. Porcini flan- pretty tasteless, slimy texture, actually the worst first course my mom and I might have ever had. Guys had the treasure of wild mushrooms they both said were delicious. Salmon - didn't taste nearly as fresh as it should, didn't care for how it was prepared, actually had trouble eating this dish and didn't even want to finish it. Â Total let down. Guys had the leg of lamb confit- or something like that and said it was very good. Dessert of chocolate souflee was okay, not great and guys seemed very happy with their desserts. Best part of the meal - the bread cart and server - describing in details all of the delicious rolls.. they were unique and very, very good. Â Not as good bread as Daniel, but Bouley's Â bread is a close second..the roll with cherries being my favorite. Rather shocked that at a 5 star place it was the bread that made my meal, but hey at least 2 of the 4 of us were very happy. So I was disappointed with my own dishes but overall it was a good experience. Â Guys must wear jackets, but they do have one you can borrow. Staff there (beside the friendly, huge personality of the bread server) were rather cold (didn't take to my father's jokes he likes to make) and all business. Yet another letdown in TriBeca for me!",1
4264,490,3,11/8/2014,"I have been coming to Bouley 1-2 times per year for the last 10 years. It has been my favorite place ever to bring people for special occasions and I would previously have given 5 stars without question. The last two times we have gone, I have been disappointed. Â We have had to wait for our table (despite reservations) and the staff in the waiting area/check-in are elusive, Â stuffy and seem to avoid eye contact so they don't have to deal with you. Â I've been really turned off by this. Â The service we had last week was a hodge podge - one of our main waiters was phenomenal and the others were all wet noodles - no personality and didn't bother to explain any of our dishes when they brought them. Part of the fun of bouley is hearing about your wonderful dish. Â When my husband had a question about two dishes he was deciding between our waiter just curtly said ""the flan"" - made the decision for him and didn't elaborate why the flan or even what the whole dish was. When my husband got it, he was ultimately disappointed and had the waiter taken the time to explain the two dishes, he would have gone with the other one. A bright star in the experience was the bread cart and the lovely gentleman who serves the bread. Both were fantastic. Overall, the food is very good and you still can't beat the prix fixe lunch price but they really need to work on their service.",1
4265,490,4,11/2/2014,"Porcini Flan is awesome, nice gin cocktails as well. The bread cart is amazing and almost ruined my appetite! The wine paring was a tad lacking, but still worth it.",1
4266,490,4,11/1/2014,"We went last night for my husband's birthday. Â The restaurant is beautiful. Â The staff were just the right amount of friendly. Â We got the tasting menu and had a glass of white and a glass of red to go with the meal. Â The courses were just the right size, and all of them ranged from very good to delicious. Â My only problem was after dinner - Â I went to use the restroom, and it was probably the most beautiful bathroom I'd ever seen, and the stall I used smelled like a urinal. Â It was pretty off-putting and shocking for a restaurant of that caliber. Â I'm taking one star off for it or I would have given them 5 stars.",1
4267,490,5,10/23/2014,"This was by far the best meal that both my husband and I have ever had!!! Â As soon as you walked in you were greeted with the fresh smell of apples from their floor to ceiling wall of apples. The service was exceptional and they provided us with excellent recommendations for both our meals and for the wine pairing. Â We were served an amuse-bouche with every single course of our meal. Â The Procini Flan was the best appetizer I have ever had. My husband ordered the chocolate souffle for dessert (which he confirmed tasted amazing) and with that they brought us a pineapple/coconut amuse-bouche, a complimentary grilled peach & sorbet dessert, PLUS a tray of a dozen housemade chocolates. Â And finally on our way out the door, after we had eaten the best food ever to our hearts content, they sent us home with a take-away lemon tea cake. The overall experience was absolutely exceptional. Â It is a must try in NYC.",1
4268,490,5,10/20/2014,"BEST. CULINARY. EXPERIENCE. EVER. I dined here with a group of 9. From start to finish, we experienced multiple emotions: amazed, giddy, supremely happy. The oohs and ahhs were bountiful as this was our best culinary experience to date. We were served 5 amuse bouches before our 5 course meal. We finished 5 bottles of champagne and along the way. And I will never forget the bread service and the best butter in the world! For a visual and flavorful culinary experience with Â impeccable service in a beautiful setting, visit Bouley.

4269,490,4,10/15/2014,"Men you are required to wear a jacket. If not, don't worry - the restaurant has a couple to loan to you for the duration of the meal. Went for the lunch tasting menu for $55 - great way to try a michelin star restaurant!",1
4270,490,1,10/14/2014,"My husband and I went for our wedding anniversary as we did last year, when it was a wonderful dining experience all around. Â Food was excellent, service was attentive but unobtrusive. Ambiance was elegant and sophisticated. We were eager to return. Unfortunately, this time was the opposite. We had to wait for our table for more than 20 minutes. No apologies offered. Â  It was more take or leave it. Â The food was ok, nothing was truly bad, but Â nothing was excellent. Â Not to mention every dish was luke-warm. The best part of the meal was the bread. Not one truly wow dish and with that price tag, I expected to be wowed. Service was amateur at best. Runners would deliver our dishes with no explanations and as we were half-way through the dish a waiter would come over to tell us what we were eating. Â The service highlight was the wine-staff especially the server who poured our wine (He made our bottle last through the whole dinner) To top it all off, there was a table were a woman got drunk and made quite a scene. (not the restaurant's fault of course) Â I'm not talking tipsy. Â I mean losing your balance, stuttering words drunk. Â Her male companion was feeling no pain either and decided to get on his cell phone and speak so loud that the whole dining room could hear him. At some point everyone in the room was shushing them. Â We had to endure this for 2 and a half hours, we were there a little more than 3. Ever wonder why Bouley only has 1 Michelin star? Here is why.",1
4271,490,3,10/13/2014,"This time around, I was somewhat surprised at the service. Â Not as well polished as my previous 2 visits. Case in point: I had to remind them that the tuna appetizer I ordered came with caviar... Who forgets the most important accompaniment to this dish? Â  Also asked the sommelier for a versatile red wine and was given 3 options by the same winemaker: $195, $265, and $390... I asked what the $120 bottle tasted like (which was also in the same section) and he just said it wasn't as good as the other 3 options. Â Don't get me wrong, the bottle ($195) I eventually chose was excellent, but was kind of turned off by him not entertaining my inquiry... Anyway, to the food...(lunch tasting menu): Tuna with caviar: Â The components clashed and the most likely culprit was the green apple broth. Â (1-2 stars) Blini of Scottish Smoked Salmon Salmon Trout Roe, White Truffle Honey (4 stars) Porcini Flan Golden Princess crab, black ruffle dashi. Delicious. All ingredients were able to shine through. (4-5 stars) Organic Long Island Duck Organic Golden Nevada Dates Hudson Valley Hand Milled Polenta (Fantastic 5 stars) Organic Colorado Lamb Tuscan olives, cured lemons 25 dollar supplement (not the best, but it was good 3-4 stars) Treistar Cooks Falls & Santa Barbara Organic Strawberries Homemade amaretto ice cream (Fresh 3-4 stars) Hot Valrhona Chocolate SoufflÃ© White Coffee Cloud, Coffee Ice Cream, Chocolate Mousse (light and good 4 stars)",1
4272,490,4,10/13/2014,It was an absolutely lovely experience i decided on the tasting menu with the wine pairing. Every dish was unique in its own way. The attention was impeccable the desserts were delicious the wine was amazing.,1
4273,490,5,10/12/2014,"Holy Trinity Tome 1. Wow. I don't know how to begin this. First there must be 21 people on this website who are either trolls or have impaired taste buds. Bouley is more then perfect. Everything is perfect. The place and the staff may come off as stiff and pretentious, granted but this should not affect your judgement because they are not so, this is just a facade they put on to make the place look special, which it is. The staff, David Bouley himself and everyone under his watch are doing everything possible to make your experience special here. Bouley does not even have a bar dining option and the place, the vibe is quite formal, so they have a dress code which might seem antiquated but is quite reasonable given the scenery and the concept of the restaurant. Bouley offers amazing, tremendous tasting menus for both lunch and dinner and the choices are all perfect. You can not go wrong with any of them but just so you know i will write some of my favorites. For lunch: You might try the Connecticut farm egg, Pennsylvania chicken and the beef cheeks. Foie gras is also good. Coconut soup and the chocolate souffle are amazing. Another appetizer that i love is the porcini flan which is quite unique. Dinner: Chocolate frivolous is the perfect dessert obviously. maybe the best dessert i have ever had. (and you know i have a lot of those every day.) Here you have sea urchin and the pheasant as additions. Pineapple souffle is another perfect choice. As mains either have the Kobe beef or the rabbit both are perfect. The decorum is amazing. The walls are all bedecked with modern impressionist paintings of french artists with velvet bordering. In addition to the tasting menu you get the chariot de pains which is like a big, all-moving bread basket -more like a car- which has millions of different options, which has fruity, whole-grainy, classical etc, every possible option. Also you get some amuse-bouches and additional courses as a compliment/surprise in between your courses of tasting menu which makes your experience even more memorable and perfect. The staff is also very courteous and attentive to your needs. They do not make mistakes and are very timely. You also get plenty of time to enjoy your food, you will not feel rushed here so feel free to allow yourself at least 3 hours for lunch or dinner. For drinks, bouley has amazing cocktails and an extensive winelist. Half bottles and bottles have some very good selections from all over the world. My favourite cocktails are either la pomme or la fraise (the apple or the strawberry respectively.) I wonder why bouley has only one michelin star because it definitely has more to offer than the other 1 michelin-starred venues (I am not saying competitors because probably bouley is the best restaurant in NYC.)",1

It's like going to a really great concert or visitng an overwhelming exhibition in your favorite museum. the food, bread, wine list, service, decor, dishes and ambiance close to perfection if not the meaning of perfection. Chef Bouley is a creative, soulful, brilliant chef, who makes sure that each and every piece stands out of the crowd and still fits so good together.

4276,490,4,10/8/2014,"Such a gastronomical paradise.....Bouley certainly lived up to its reputation as being among the elite dining establishments in NYC. Â What an exquisite assault on the senses! Â From the presentation, aromas, to the actual tasting....everything was superbly executed. The wait staff were excellent; attentive and knowledgeable. Â They appeared to be truly enjoying their jobs, quite unlike wait staff at some similar type establishments. Â It was very convivial atmosphere, not stuffy or staid whatsoever. Â  The chariot de pain lent quite a nice quaint touch to the entire ambience/experience. Â I tried the fig bread and a bit of the hazelnut, again I was not disappointed. Â  I started with the Porcini Flan (with buttery crab) followed by the Lobster...both dishes were delicately seasoned and cooked to perfection, textures and taste superb. Â My friend had the Oysters and Bass. Â She enjoyed the oysters immensely but the fish was a bit of a let down, she said. Â The side of creamy type potatoes was divinely smooth and the palate cleanser, a yogurt/raspberry concoction made our salivary glands tingle with joy. My dessert, the mandarin tart, was simply Â ""melt in you mouth"" good as was my companion's Anjou Pear. Â To top it all off, the petite fours......life's little sweet treats....Bouley, bravo!!

Since have only eaten here 18-20 times.. The food is amazing, the staff is super friendly and the service is exceptional.. Not once but every single time...

Not much to say here other than its worth trying. Definitely not a place to bring kids and much more of a formal dinner. Crowd is also on the older side.,1
4279,490,5,10/4/2014,"The Service: The Bouley waitstaff must be trained in all manners of hospitality and are also able to read your mind. Out of nowhere people came to give us bread, fill our water, bring our food at the precise moment after I was finished thinking ""oh I can't wait for the next course right about...wait...oh here it is."" The head mind reader also knew when I was going to use the facilities because he escorted me to the top of the stairs when I got up. The service and the care with which the waitstaff treats their customers is superlative in every way from the moment you enter and from the time you finally leave. The only thing that was missing was my wheelbarrow to cart me out of the place, because of.. The Food: Mr. David Bouley has mastered the fine art of preserving the light of King Arthur's sword to cut through the richness of unicorn tears mixed with the buckle of a leprechaun's belt. Each dish from the tasting menu - we enjoyed ourselves at Bouley on a late September's night, for seasonal reference - tasted fresh and ingeniously prepared. My husband found himself giggling at the beginning of each bite, which can only be attributed to the the dish being made with a shaving of the One Ring in its sauce. I was lost in food heaven as the plate was set before me, and then lost in food ecstasy when the dish was explained to me by a house elf, and then finally lost in food ermmygerd as my subconscious surfaced to remind me to slow the hell down so that it could process every complex cluster of paradise that I was allowed to consume. BLUF: The food and service were outstanding. Couldn't think of a better place to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Other notes: Dining room upstairs is gorgeous - the softly glowing vaulted ceilings are luxe, but not overt and makes you feel like you're dining in an eggshell. Decor is French countryside cool, with velvet frames encasing relaxing bucolic scenes of lavender fields and poplar trees. The bread man and the sommelier were absolutely personable and charming. Can't wait to return here again. Bravo, Bouley!",1

4281,490,5,9/23/2014,"Bouley is one of those restaurants that you can count on to impress you and your date every single time. The decor, staff, quality of food, and ambiance make the entire dining experience an unforgettable one. The tasting menu is a great option which allows you to just sit back and enjoy the different dishes Bouley has to offer. For the first course, I had the Blini of Scottish Smoked Salmon which is Salmon Trout Roe with White Truffle Honey. From the first bite, you know Bouley sets a high expectation of the quality of the ingredients that they serve their patrons ! The second course which has been the most memorable and my personal favoitre is the Porcini Flan with Alaskan Dungeness crab and black ruffle dashi. This aromatic dish is simply perfection and the definition of a ""signature"". I had the Slow Braised Kobe Style Beef Cheeks with Blue Kale Gnocchi for my third course. The beef cheeks were braised to perfection and the gnocchi was a great complement. For the fourth course, I had the Chilled Coconut Soup with Pineapple granite, 10 exotic fruit sorbet and amaretto ice cream. The soup was amazing and ice cream can only be described as smooth. My girlfriend ordered the Treistar Cooks Falls & Santa Barbara Organic Strawberries with Homemade amaretto ice cream. The fifth and final course for me was the Hot Valrhona Chocolate SoufflÃ© with White Coffee Cloud, Coffee Ice Cream, Chocolate Mousse. What an awesome finish this was to a wonderful meal ! The souffle melts in your mouth and the spoonfuls of coffee ice cream was simply wonderful. Throughout the meal, the chef would send out ""specials"" which is a great extra in between courses. A bread cart also makes it's way around at least twice with many selections. I personally loved the brioche ! Bouley is definitely a special restaurant which is consistent with it's service and food every visit. If you are looking to celebrate a special occasion, look no further !",1

For some reason we missed the memo about jacket required so the hostess let my husband borrow a jacket. Beautiful dining room. Made us feel like we're in French Countryside. The dinner itself was good but I don't remember loving every details. The most memorable dish for me was the porcini flan. Sooo delicious! I could have a giant bowl and it wouldn't be enough. I honestly cannot remember the entree I had...but I guess this was over a year ago. I remember they had a bread cart that went table to table with offerings of what must have been over 20 kinds of breads... The cart smelled like the most amazing bakery and my husband still talks about it to this day. Overall, I would say a good choice for special occasion dinner, but I wasn't WOW'ed.",1
4283,490,4,9/19/2014,"Came here with my girls for my 25th birthday. The food was okay. My reservation was 5:45pm since they only had 5:45 or after 9 open. My party came a bit late, they had plenty of seats even by 6:30-7pm. The service was great. They gave each of us a bag of loaf when we were leaving. My friend joked that they knew we wouldn't be full.",1
4284,490,3,9/15/2014,I did the pre fix wine pairing lunch. First the service and decor and ambiance is terrific.The food was overrated and was expensive to say the least. The chef still uses a lot of foam in their presentations which I was never a fan of. If I go back again I will order off the menu as opposed to the tasting menu . I just spent a weekend at the Inn In Little Washington and the food was spectacular and dwarfed my experience at Bouley.,1
4285,490,4,9/14/2014,"Interior, service, appetizers, desserts were all impeccable. However the main courses leave more to be desired (I totally agree with the previous yelper). Knowing David's style and how meticulous and fanatical he is about food, I had higher expectations. Lamb for instance was very tender but the taste was average and rather blend. P.S. Oh, one more thing. They require men to wear jackets even when it's Summer, 90 degrees outside, and 200% humidity!!! This is ridiculous and meaningless, as everyone puts on a jacket right before entering, and immediately takes it off as soon as one is seated. What's the whole point then??? Alas, the first items I mentioned made me come back several times and I'll probably will again. Overall, I'd highly recommend it and most people would not regret it.",1
4286,490,5,9/13/2014,umm wow! wow wow wow. Ate there for dinner last night - party of two - last seating at 10:45. Â It was basically perfect. Â Couldn't have been any better. Â The porcini flan was one of the better dishes that basically exists in the universe. Â  We both got the tasting menu and didn't overlap any items. Â It was just the right amount of food. Â The service is just the definition of top notch - they give you a nice description of the dish after it arrives reminding you what all the ingredients are which is helpful. Â The ambiance was beautiful. I wish we had gotten there earlier to have to time to have a drink in the lounge area outside of the main dining room. Â Would recommend without reservation to anyone looking for an upscale dining experience.,1
4287,490,5,9/13/2014,One of my favorite restaurants in the world. Â Just had another great meal with some friends from Canada. Â A true dining experience,1
4288,490,5,9/13/2014,"Formal and upscale dining experience with all of the luxuries that can be expected from that sort of establishment. The decor is a little too ostentatious, think 19th century France. The floor to ceiling shrine of red apples was my favorite element of decor. The staff are very knowledgeable and meals are impeccably executed. The noise level is very mild compared to the average thundering sound typical of popular restaurants. Each composition contained complimentary flavors and ingredients that sent reverberation through every taste bud. Bouley is perfect for a formal business gathering, anniversary, dinner with parents and a very romantic date leading into a proposal; or just an extraordinary gastronomic journey.",1
4289,490,4,9/12/2014,"Tip: Jackets are a must for gentlemen! For an establishment like Bouley, I was expecting to be blown away and give it 5 stars (read on to understand why I had to deduct 1 star). We had dinner reservations booked for a Sunday evening at 6.30PM and upon arrival, there were already a handful of tables occupied. I've dined at a number of fine upscale establishments and with each one, I'm able to pinpoint some of the more notable mentions. Bouley, in my book, seems to excel in its appetizers and desserts but the mains leave more to be desired. Â  The tasting menu is a great choice especially for those first-timers here, as it offers a nice mix for your taste buds. You can really taste the distinct flavors in each individual dish with the creative combination of ingredients prepared by the Chef. The dining room is quite unique as it is more homey than it is anything else. The decor is warm and seating is intimate. You can easily hear your neighbor's conversation as the ambiance was probably the quietest I've yet to experience. Fortunately, the couple seated next to us were just fine, though from time to time the lady's laughter was attention-seeking. The staff is friendly and a description of each dish was given before we dived in. In addition to the tasting menu, we also ordered the seared foie-gras which was served before our mains and was prepared perfectly! By the time this was served, I was already stuffed silly! There was so much food to be had and trust me, there are no complaints there, however, it would've been nice if the pace of each dish was a little more spread out to allow us to digest in between servings. Overall, it was a nice experience and the food was great. My husband and I both agreed, however, that the mains (I had the lamb chop and he had the duck) did not stand out nearly as much as the starters and dessert, but overall was an experience to be had. The texture of the lamb chops were OK though a bit under-cooked and flavor was good. I suppose with all the hype and the great dishes served leading up to the mains, we were expecting a little more oomph!",1
4290,490,5,9/8/2014,Pricey but perhaps the best dining experience I ever had. The service was impeccable and the tasting menu was so filling... So many different treats from the chef. Then at the end we got a gift basket of like some bakery. They probably used so many pates and utensils for me it was unbelievable. The food was great too of course. I highly recommend the dining experience here.,1
4291,490,5,9/8/2014,"This TriBeCa restaurant was like being in the Loire Valley or Provence at one of the small Michelin starred restaurants we have enjoyed in the past. We all chose the Prix fixe lunch menu. Â The gluten-free cracker, topped with potato purÃ©e and black truffle is something we shall never forget. The salmon melted in your mouth as did the duck. Â The food choices were all very exciting, delicious and satisfying. Â Somehow we managed to fit in a cheese course (which was very ample for three) before dessert. Â The cheese selection was very beautifully selected and it rivaled cheese courses that we have had throughout the world. Â The two bottles of champagne that were recommended by the sommelier complimented our meal perfectly. The sommelier was a young Frenchman who seemed as though he enjoyed being part of the staff (which worked like a family). Â It was as though we were truly dining in one of the small French chateaus that is now a Michelin starred restaurant, while being served by a very talented (albeit- multinational) family. Even the bread stewart made us feel at home with his excellent suggestions! Â Compliments to the chef and the staff at Bouley! We look forward to returning! Â I imagine it will have an additional star, since the Michelin people seem to know their stuff! Â Bravo Bouley!",1
1959,490,4,9/4/2014,"We came here for my fiancee's early birthday dinner last weekend, even though we were a bit hesitant given that the other restaurant affiliated with Bouley (Brushstroke) was an unmitigated flop all around. However, with very solid reviews - as well as a reservation at prime time for eating dinner (8 PM on a Friday), we decided to come here. I will say that you will have to definitely return their calls when they confirm your reservation, or they will just go ahead and cancel on you via OpenTable (which I was not a huge fan of - thanks for screwing me out of 100 points, guys) - not really the mark of great service. That said, once we got into the restaurant, the service was much better and attentive (if for the fact that it took several minutes too long for the sommelier to come and discuss wines with us). The overall decor of the restaurant is a bit quaint, but I will say there is nothing like opening the entrance to a restaurant and first stepping into a room filled with fresh apples - that made me hungry from the get-go, and it was a very nice way to set you up for the dining room, which was decorated with plenty of flowers and had wall paintings evoking the French countryside (I think). The drinks here are well-executed, although if you're a beer person (as I am), you'll be discouraged by the high prices. I ended up going with the floral cocktail, which was very well-prepared - the liquor didn't come through too strongly. The bottle of red that the sommelier picked out was excellent as well; it wasn't overly sweet, but it didn't end up leaving me with a 'jammy' mouthfeel that most reds do after a while. The amuse-bouche was a delicious start, with a tomato soup that was infused lightly with strawberries and given a bit of texture with ice shavings - a very clean way to start the meal. We ended up going with tasting menus but getting different items each step along the way. I went with the foraged mushrooms, which were particularly delicious with the shavings of black truffle. However, I was a bit disappointed in the grilled toro, which was a bit nondescript in flavor. My fiancee's sea urchin and caviar had that delicious creamy texture, but the flavor was unfortunately masked by the strong clementine (or orange) that it was served with. A dash of citrus would have been delicious, but it ended up feeling like eating the equivalent of a very creamy orange. While good, I felt it was a waste of two very decadent ingredients. Next, I went with the porcini flan - absolutely fantastic flavor that captured the richness of the mushroom flavor, and the egg custard basically had the texture of chawanmushi. I think 'flan' is the wrong description (as I would expect something with firmer shape/texture), but this was still one of my favorite dishes. I had a bite of the langoustine that my fiancee had, which was well-prepared too. I went with the lobster next, which I really enjoyed with the almond dressing - a plainer but light flavor that worked nicely with the succulence of the lobster (which was much fresher than that served at Brushstroke, FWIW). The restaurant then did us a real solid and brought out scallops served with hearts of palm on the house. Usually I'm a bit worried about free courses in tasting menus, given the limited stomach size, but the scallops were cooked perfectly, and the heart of palms added a nice, tropical dash to them. I then ended up going with the veal, which, while delicious, wasn't as juicy as I would have thought. The rack of lamb that my fiancee ordered was definitely better, with that slightly gamier flavor of the lamb really coming through. The first dessert course / palate cleanser was actually very, very good - both the blackberry and huckleberry 'soups' (which were served with sorbets - huckleberry had a plain yogurt sorbet, which was very refreshing against the tart sweetness of the berry) were excellent ways of setting the table for the finale. I went with the chocolate frivolous, which was a combination of chocolates - a small lava cake, a couple of chocolate ice creams/sorbets, etc. - that were rich examples of utilizing Valrhona chocolate. My fiancee did the warm fruit tart, which was a nice, fruity contrast to the heaviness of the chocolate. Because it was my fiancee's dinner, they brought out another dessert (which I've forgotten), and concluded with a delicious mix of petit fours. We also got a small loaf of (what I think was) poundcake to go. In all - the food was delicious, but while it was executed very well, there wasn't anything so innovative or executed at the absolute highest levels that impressed me. I enjoyed the attentive service, as well as the extras that were provided, but for the price, I felt that it fell a bit short of a 5-star rating. I'd definitely come back again, but I might stick with the a la carte menu next time - especially since I could probably experience some of the delicious bread (served from a cart - just like cheese) they have!",1
4292,490,4,9/4/2014,"This review is for the lunch tasting at Bouley (5 course $55). I made the reservation a couple of weeks in advance for lunch on a Saturday for four people. To start off, the moment you walk through the door you smell the sweetness of real apples (they are displayed all along the walls). For some reason, this was extremely refreshing and memorable (I hope it's not just me haha). Throughout our lunch the service was amazing. Our whole party opted for the lunch tasting menu and for the most part we all ordered different things so we got to try quite a variety of dishes: The Amuse bouche to start (if I remember correctly) was explained to me as a gazpacho with soy sauce ice cream and the other was a crisp with cheese and black truffle. I really enjoyed both as a light and refreshing start to our tasting. 1) Blini of Scottish Smoked Salmon - The moment this came out, it looked like a thin pieces of smoked salmon sandwiched in between two marshmallows but these white fluffy things were meringue (very soft and airy in texture) and it was a tad bit sweet with white truffle honey. Definitely an interesting and unexpected taste. Big Eye Tuna - I distinctly remember the green apple aroma which was essentially in the form of a foam. The tuna tasted fine but this wasn't my favorite. Chlorophyll Blast - This was a green thick soup which was the favorite out of the first courses. This one sounds like a healthier option but it's a little heavy on the stomach for a starter course so keep that in mind maybe. 2) Forager's Treasure of Wild Mushrooms - The presentation of this dish was the prettiest. I enjoyed the variety of mushrooms on this plate along with the grilled toro. Definitely a good option for the second course! Porcini Flan - Â I hear that this is Bouley's signature - it's a chawanmushi! It's definitely different from the one that I tried at Brushstroke (Bouley's other restaurant) but the truffle dashi was flavorful. Sea Bass- For this course I definitely had some type of fish (and I believe it was sea bass although I could be wrong...). Anyways, this dish was phenomenal, maybe my favorite out of the tasting menu. The fish was perfectly cooked and flavorful. This is a dish I'd order again. 3) Wild Alaskan Salmon - Unfortunately, this wasn't my favorite. This dish came with two spreads (is that what you call them?) the green was avocado and the orange was something else I cant remember. I wasn't a fan of either of those spreads but on the plus side the salmon was again, nicely cooked and was good on its own. Slow Braised Kobe Style Beef Cheeks - This was a lot richer in the flavor and the beef cheeks were very soft. I'd say get this one over the salmon if you came hungry. Otherwise, you can order the other entrees like chicken, lamb, or duck! 4) Chilled Coconut Soup - So this course was the toughest decision I had to make. If you like coconut though, this is a must-order. I enjoyed this dessert VERY much. Treistar Cooks Fals & Santa Barbara Organic Strawberries - This dessert ended up being just as good as the coconut soup. You have to eat the almond ice cream and strawberries together. 5) Chocolate Souffle - MMM, this is chocolate-y goodness. I understand why they serve the lighter tasting fruitier desserts first because you can't possibly eat those right after this rich chocolate dessert. But keep in mind this is one sweeet dessert - you may want to order tea or coffee with it. Hot Caramelized Anjou Pear - I'm sorry, I was too full to even try this one but it looked good?? haha The bread cart also comes around during your meal. They have an amaaaazing bread selection that you just want a slice of all of them... but be careful, this is how you get too full and can't finish your dessert (like me). The only slightly negative point was our tea that we ordered at Â the end. I guess they didn't let the tea sit for long enough... because it was very weak, light in color, and had no scent of tea. We had to ask that they re-make it but when we asked (I guess he may have been new... ) I don't think he knew exactly what we were asking... Anyways, everything else was splendid and overall a great dining experience. With drinks and whatnot it ended up being around $100 per person for lunch but it's a great opportunity to try Bouley's dishes.",1
4293,490,5,9/2/2014,Lunch at Bouley is an amazing bargain. Â $110.00 per person with the wine pairings. Â Food and wine were exceptional and the place is beautiful in the way great restaurants used to be.,1
3643,490,5,8/30/2014,"I can't begin this review with enough fantastic things to say about this wonderful restaurant. I came in here the other day for my birthday lunch and ordered the tasting menu with the wine pairing. From the moment I sat down they treated me like gold. The staff went out of their way to ensure I had a fun and enjoyable dining experience. The waiter and sommelier were extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Â  They started me off with an amuse bouche to open up my palate. Then gave me a goat cheese and black truffle spread on a thin crisp. Wow was it delicious. The first course was the smoked salmon blini with white truffle honey followed by a tuna tartare with a green apple foam and caviar. Wowwwww is all I can say for both courses. They had a bread cart coming around with about 15 different types of bread. The bread expert was so nice and let me taste 5 different breads. The garlic was 100% my favorite, but then again I am a garlic lover. My next course was their signature dish and arguably my favorite. It was the porcini flan with Dungeness crab in a black truffle dashi. I think this may be one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. It was the perfect texture and each bite felt savory but not too rich. They also brought me out two surprise courses. One was a lobster, artichoke, mango and ham terrine, which was fabulous. This should always be on the menu. The next was seared scallops with shaved avocado and fennel pollen. Each course was cooked to perfection and paired beautifully with the wine I was brought. For my entree, I ordered the slow braised Kobe style beef cheeks with the blue kale gnocchi. Each bite melted in mouth and I found myself saying mmmm out loud in the quiet restaurant. Oops Â  By the time the dessert courses came I felt myself struggling to eat another bite. Surely, I managed, because they brought out a chocolate soufflÃ©, hot caramelized pear, and a small birthday cake with a candle. They sent me home with some chocolates and a pound cake. This meal was worth every single penny. Even if I basically had to roll my extremely full self out of the the restaurant. This was one of the best and most unique dining experiences I have ever had. The service was impeccable and the food was perfect. I wouldn't change a thing about this meal. Thank you to the Bouley team for making my birthday very special.",1
4294,490,2,8/27/2014,"In shock that this place was rated THIS YEAR as the #2 top restaurant by zagat and that its so highly rated on yelp. Perhaps lunch vs. dinner is entirely different? The 3 of us had the lunch tasting menu which is a ""steal"" vs. ordering off the regular a la carte menu. The service was awful. Not only were the guys all chit chatting on the side and making jokes the entire meal, but this took away from the service. We had to ask over a handful of times for water refills - maybe they should have been focusing on that instead? Despite one person in our party still enjoying the 4th course they pushed dessert on our table and wedged it behind her. As she reacted in a surprised manner he explained ""well the ice cream is going to melt!"" Â Really? You didn't wait until we were done with the course before pushing out the final? So yes service was pretty shockingly bad for a place that's suppose to be top notch for New York. We wondered if this was the training staff only but doubt it. And even if it were the captain was also joining in on the jokes and unprofessional demeanor. The food was also NOT impressive.. The flavors just didn't jive for me from the chlorophyll soup to the porcini flan and pear dessert it just wasn't quite right. The duck main and strawberry and almond ice cream ""pre-dessert"" were the only enjoyable dishes Â  For me.",1
4295,490,4,8/24/2014,"Bouley is a top notch expensive restaurant. The food is very good, makes you want more. We did a prefix menu tasting, and the service was outstanding. My boyfriend even said that his complimentary walnut bread was the best bread he ever tasted. My experience was good. Overall this place has a more romantic/intimate field to it.",1
4296,490,5,8/20/2014,My boyfriend took me there:DD. We had the tasting menu for brunch. Ate a lot and love it,1
4297,490,4,8/14/2014,"It was early January. The kind of cold day that will make you crave an unusually extravagant lunch in a Garden of Eden-like main dining room that felt like a celebration. The apple wall was ripe but I didn't mind its smell at all. To me it was very inviting, sweet, and fresh. The perfect metaphorical beginning to a blissful meal that will remain on my top five list. Except for one salty mushroom, the food from the lunch tasting menu was at least five-star, and the service was impeccable and priceless. Our French waiter knew about Chawanmushi and explained its influence to Bouley's porcini flan, as if he was a teacher lecturing at Le Cordon Bleu. I still remember everything he said during the meal, especially about the porcini flan. When the covered ramekin arrived to our table he said, ""I won't uncover it for you because I want you to enjoy the aromas of the dish."" It was extremely easy to heed the French gentleman's advice and enjoy the aromas and everything else about the glorious flan. The truffles, the delicate crabmeat, the intensely mild but complex flavor, and the expert culinary effort that made everything come together in such a small dish were easily noticed. I hopefully imagined I'd experience it again and again. But we went back in mid-July, and the French gentleman had done what ""gentlemen"" do best and runn offt. Or at least I didn't see him, making his rounds to ensure that his tables were happy. This time the service was less Prince Charming, and much more regular. Â We had a very smartly dressed, with tie and jacket, waitress that, for most of the meal, we didn't get a chance to talk with or ask questions. She disappeared and would come back sporadically, so we asked a bus boy/assistant waiter if he knew what was in the amuse bouche, and he gave us a tiny ingredient list: truffles (which we knew), cheese, potatoes, and cream. My dining partner asked what kind of cheese. He said the name of the cheese but when we couldn't understand him, he said it was a French cheese. Ha! I insisted that my dining partner get the porcini flan this time. When it came out she didn't know what to do with the cover. Our new waiter gave no explanation, no background information on the dish, and certainly no feeling that we were in good hands. But again, I remembered the French gentleman's instructions to remove the cover myself to enjoy the aromas and relayed it to my friend. She watched as I lifted the cover and began waving it back and forth, and then I began to taste it. I noticed the color and texture were different. No longer black and cream swirling around each other, it was all black on top from the truffles and an enormous amount of pepper. The mild, complex flavor was still there, just punctuated by the pepper. I was thankful for extra crabmeat, but I wondered if its increase made the dish much more watery and no longer a flan. My friend lifted her cover with an uncertainty that encompasses my overall feelings about my second lunch at Bouley. Good. Some might say great even, but just not as good as the first.",1
4298,490,5,8/12/2014,"Wow, what an amazing place. Food was amazing.. ambiance was amAzing. Our server was very knowledgable and pointed us in the right direction. Â Pricey but defiantly worth it. Â A must try",1
4299,490,4,8/11/2014,"It's so hard to sum up this experience. This place is fantastic. I am an extremely picky Eater so when I can eat so many things I am shocked. My gf and I got the tasting menu which is technically 5 courses but is really closer to 7. I rly cant go into everything but the starter of truffles and cream on a cracker was ridiculously good. It's a welcome dish and is so amazing. Also get the mushroom foragers if you're into that. Amazing. The chicken was very good as we're the desserts. The bread is great and the guy who serves it is so nice. The only reason I deducted a star is because I heard one employee berating another who must have been new. My gf and I rly did not like that. Â Other than that, Â the food is exceptional. I'll definitely bring my lady back here!",1
4300,490,5,8/11/2014,"I've gotten so used to pricey restaurants with bar stool seating and like Arcade Fire Pandora radio that Bouley struck me at first as a little bit stiff and musty. Then I thought, well what's wrong with an expensive restaurant actually acting like it's expensive? Bouley is a fancy place, with top notch service and formal atmosphere. The furniture is mansion parlor opulent, there are flowers on every table, and every man is required to wear a jacket. The clientele when my mother and I went for lunch was almost 100% Asian tourist. The restaurant is anti-trendy but super nice. Lunch is the time to go--Bouley offers a five-course tasting menu for $55, with at least two choices for each course. Not cheap by any means, but not a bad value. My mom and I tried two different dishes for each course. You can get a wine pairing for an extra $55. I got a glass of Riesling, which was plenty (and also delicious). We also got unlimited bread (fancy shit, no breadsticks). Bouley has its own bakery and the bread service includes a huge selection off an overflowing bread cart. We tried apple raisin, jalapeÃ±o baguette, apricot walnut, saffron walnut, garlic bread, and brioche. Every one was fantastic. The meal kicked off with a couple amuse bouches. We had a refreshing soup of strawberry and tomato geleÃ©, served with a dollop of soy ice cream. We also had squares of kudzu bread topped with aligot and black truffle. Decadent and lovely. The first of our five courses was a light appetizer. We shared the big eye tuna and the blini of Scottish smoked salmon. The tuna was silky and fresh, served with green apple foam, bergamot, and a spoonful of Osetra caviar. The blini was maybe my favorite dish of the meal. The blini were puffed and pillowy, collapsing around delicate layers of smoked salmon and salmon trout roe touched with white truffle honey. For our second course we went full fungus with two mushroom dishes. The forager's treasure of wild mushrooms was a beautiful mix of different mushrooms, flavored with sweet garlic, special spices, and a foamy black truffle dressing. A couple strips of tender grilled toro finished the dish. The porcini flan was also superb, creamy and flavorful, laced with a black truffle dashi. A big hunk of Golden Princess crab added sweetness and texture. Our last savory course brought two entrees: all-natural Pennsylvania chicken and slow braised Kobe style beef cheeks. The chicken was wonderful, moist and tender, baked ""en cocotte"" with alfalfa and clover hay, then plated with organic butter beans, Swiss chard, and tiny shells of Brussels sprout. The beef cheeks were less good. I found the texture gluey to the point of being a little unpleasant, and the flavors were really heavy. The blue kale gnocchi was okay but didn't make the beef any better. Our entrees also came with a side of buttery whipped potatoes, which were very nice with the chicken, overkill with the already rich beef. The rest of the meal was devoted to dessert, spread over two courses. I loved the first round, which featured light fruity desserts--organic strawberries with amaretto ice cream and chilled coconut soup with pineapple granite, 10 exotic fruit sorbet, and more amaretto ice cream. The strawberries were gorgeous and simply presented, and I enjoyed the cool refreshing coconut soup. We were almost too full to enjoy the last desserts, but I recognize that they were good. We had a hot Valrhona chocolate soufflÃ© and a hot caramelized Anjou pear tart. The soufflÃ© was warm with a rich liquidy center, served with a white coffee cloud, coffee ice cream, and chocolate mousse. The pear came on a Biscuit Breton with Valhrona chocolate and hot toffee sauce, with lemon verbena and Tahitian vanilla ice cream on the side. It was a pleasant way to end the meal. Bouley may not be a perfect restaurant, but I enjoyed our lunch and would recommend the prix fixe to anyone. It was a fine dining experience with a decent value, and some of the food really was remarkable.",1
4301,490,5,8/9/2014,"I went to Bouley for a romantic dinner with my boyfriend. Â Of course, I was running late and everyone was very gracious in never mentioning or making a big fuss about it. I'm not a foodie but my boyfriend is. We had the tasting menu and everything was delicious. Â There isn't more I can say about it except it it delicious. Â You will be spoiled and any post-Bouley cuisine you have will not be enjoyed. I do find, however, that the service was a little omnipresent (good/bad depending on how you look at it) but not intuitive. Â If you're going to ""be everywhere"", shouldn't you imagine I need something if I'm staring you down? Â I didn't take anything away for that because it was that one time.

4302,490,3,8/9/2014,"Loved Bouley the first time we came here for dinner about a year ago- amazing service, food, ambience, everything. Often sang praises about this place to our friends who were visiting NYC too. So I was really looking forward to trying out their tasting menu at lunch today, but we ended up leaving disappointed. We were escorted to the dining room downstairs, to a table behind the door even though the room was empty, so we requested for a change of tables. We dined upstairs previously, which was a far more pleasant experience. The servers were nice, they did their jobs for sure, but it felt extremely impersonal and at times unnerving, especially when they kept staring at us, as if hurrying us to finish our food. This was unlike the type of service we received on our previous visit. The food was sadly very average, nothing spectacular. I felt that perhaps being downstairs could have contributed to this- it was quiet, awkward and we didn't feel comfortable talking very much at all. I also asked for a bag stool but they had none, so I had to leave my bag on the floor. Perhaps it's the high expectations that came along with this visit, but I don't know if I will return again.",1
4303,490,2,8/9/2014,"I really want to give this place 5 stars, but my last experience was deeply upsetting. I came here for a long lunch on my father's birthday. While the food is always spectacular, the service really turned me off. I had two requests with my reservations: the bill be handed to me at the end and that they put a candle in my dad's dessert. Though I spoke to the front desk the day before about this request, neither of those things happened. Towards the end of the meal, I quietly Â told one of the servers what had happened. He looked at me, and then walked away. The manager then came over and asked what had happened (in front of my family), and after the explanation, he gave a quick ""okay"" and walked away briskly. It was extraordinarily rude. This experience ruined my view of Bouley and what should have been a special meal. I used to always come here for special occasions, and recommend this place to my friends. I won't be back to be treated poorly.",1
4304,490,5,8/8/2014,"My friend really hyped up this place as her fav place in the city. Â Usually that's the kiss of death, but not in this case. Come here for lunch. Â It's one of the best deals in the city. Â It will still be expensive, but nothing like coming for dinner. Â I did it twice. Â Both times excellent and memorable. Â  Â Second time for my birthday and everything was flawless. Â Actually just thinking about it makes me want to come back for lunch again! Â Some things that stood out- porcini flan, steak, and just at the end when you're pretty much stuffed this huge chocolate dessert. Â They also gave me a Â nice size cake to take home for my b day. Â awesome.",1
4305,490,5,8/7/2014,"One of the best lunches I have ever had in New York City. We took our Mother there for her Birthday and it was an amazing experience. Although an expensive restaurant, the ""Lunch Menu"" is actually quite reasonable considering the quality. Make sure you dress nice - jacket and tie men!",1
4306,490,5,8/7/2014,"My dinner at Bouley ranks up there as one of the finest dining experiences of my life. Where to even begin? The food, the service, the atmosphere? Nothing negative could be said except for the fact that eventually had to end. My dinner experience started before I even entered the restaurant. As I waited for my family to arrive I peered in through the glass windows the open onto the kitchen. A good looking chef smiled and waved, and a staff member chatted with me on his way in. Not to be the creepy girl with her face pressed against the glass, I entered and was solicitously relieved of my heavy laptop case, and ushered into a plush lounge to wait for the rest of my party. Â I was followed in by the wafting scent of apples, an aromatic preview of the sensory experience yet to come. My family arrived and we were seated at a table the size of the ones they serve giant Chinese dim sum meals on. Stretching my arms to each side, I could just reach my sister if she did the same. We were served our desired cocktails, presented with menus and bread and then left to contemplate the feast before us. I decided on the porcini flan to start with ( how could I not with the constant chorus of ""it's so delicious"" on yelp). My parents ordered the scallop and shrimp appetizer. As we awaited the arrival of our apps, what to our wondering eyes should appear but gazpacho gelee and the most luxuriously black truffle scented crisp I have ever laid nostrils upon. Could I have a hundred of those please? And then arrived the sommelier, a charming Frenchman with a tie pin shaped like a corkscrew. Did I love him almost immediately? Indeed, I did. He directed us to the perfect wines to pair with our dinner options ( more on those later) and retreated leaving us to our conversation. Truly one of the most impressive things about the service was that it was omnipresent and yet completely unobtrusive. Our waiter picked the perfect times to enter and exit, as did the bussers and the sommelier. You were politely directed to the bathroom when needed but otherwise left entirely to you own devices. And I haven't even talked about the food yet! The best thing about dining with my family is that everyone got something different, which meant that I got to try two different appetizers, 4 entrees, and two desserts. The porcini flan was tasty, although I loved the scallops and shrimp in 'ocean' broth. As for the entrees, I ordered milk fed veal in a chive sauce, with saffron potatoes. I'm not exaggerating by saying that it melted in my mouth. Utter splendor. My mother order the duck, which was perfectly cooked and seasoned gorgeously, my father had lobster( my second favorite entree of the night). It was served in a cream sauce, but lacked all the heavy nice that might imply. It was like a warm saffron-y melted lobster ice cream, with utterly tender chunks of meat to punctuate each bite. My sister's lamb was yet another example of a classic meat cooked to its most perfect mouth orgasm feel. The entrees were followed by a watermelon granita 'erase bouche' ( palate cleanser essentially) and then the 3 citrus tart ( served with violet sorbet) and a chocolate dessert amusingly named ""frivolous."" Although we had only order two desserts, our waiter gifted us the experience of a third, the berry parfait. Although not a sweets fanatic, I did not leave a single aspect unsampled. In fact, when a finally table centerpiece composed of tiny dishes with chocolates and mini macarons arrived it was almost too much. Only almost though. We ate all of that too. Sadly we could not live forever in the luxurious world of magical French cooking, so we paid our ( rather immense) bill, and wandered out to the foyer, only to find that they had prepared individual lemon tea cakes for us each to take home and were allowed to choose an entire loaf of one of their many homemade breads to take home. We picked rosemary and olive, and with contented, fattened sighs, wandered out to the street to hail a cab.",1
4307,490,5,8/5/2014,"Went here for my engagement dinner after my fiancÃ© proposed to me in Central Park. The staff made the night incredibly special for us. We were treated to complimentary champagne, and we received a free dessert with ""Congratulations"" written in chocolate on the plate. We also received complimentary courses and a tea cake to take home for breakfast the next day (it looked as though everyone who dined at the restaurant received these goodies as well!). All of the food was amazing. We split a seafood salad to start. I forget what the entrees were (I was too distracted by the fact I had just got engaged), but it all tasted amazing (I do remember that). And the bread cart was super unique! Great place for a slow-paced, romantic dinner!",1
4308,490,5,8/1/2014,I had an outstanding dinner with a friend. Â Outstanding in all respects. The flavored of my dishes were very interesting. Among the best I have tasted in a long time. Â We had a 1996 white burgundy which was in outstanding condition. For a great meal with outstanding wine choices I highly recommend Bouley. Even Â  Better than I had remembered..,1
4309,490,4,7/29/2014,"Being on a student budget and having a family that doesn't really do the whole 'fine dining' thing, I was really excited to go here as part of a work lunch--and I was not disappointed at all. Be warned that your meal will take a long time (several hours). But it allows you to enjoy all the food on the five-course tasting menu, along with the complimentary courses. The service was attentive without being suffocating, and responsive when someone asked to speed things up a little. 1st course: smoked salmon blini. It's roe wrapped in a fluffy cotton candy-like blini. The combination of the different textures and flavors is basically a party in your mouth. 2nd course: porcini flan. This is also another dish where the combination of textures really makes it--the flavor was more salty than anything else. 3rd course: duck did not disappoint, even if the polenta was a little bland. The fat on the duck was perfectly crisped, and not slimy at all. Dessert 1: strawberries and ice cream. Delicious, although I wondered how much the strawberries had been sweetened, although it's possible they tasted so strong because of where they're sourced from. Dessert 2: chocolate souffle. Ok at this point in the meal I am absolutely stuffed so it's hard to savor it as much, but I also don't think the flavors in this were as strong as I expected--it was mostly overwhelmed by the chocolatey-ness of the souffle itself. After that, I could not bear to eat the complimentary strawberry parfait or the petit desserts. Out of all the complimentary courses, the only one that stood out to me was the fingerling mashed potatoes. All in all, it was a great meal and a great experience and I'm glad I could go.",1
4310,490,5,7/27/2014,Loved Bouley and our server Mr George Thomas. Super nice staff. Very attentive. My boyfriend and I ordered the tasting menu each. Definitely try the tasting menu with the wine paring. The food was amazing; paired exquisitely together. I will definitely be back for some more!,1
4311,490,4,7/25/2014,"This review is for the $55 lunch tasting menu, so I have to add a star for the (relatively) amazing value for money this represents. Â The stand-outs for me were the Â incredibly creative amuse-bouches, and the blini of smoked salmon with salmon trout roe. Â The blini (which is supposed to be a thin pancake) is a really unusual and exciting interpretation here. Â I also join in with the chorus of people raving about the porcini flan - it's really worth trying at least once. Â The duck was fine, and I think the chilled coconut soup is a better choice for course # 4. Â The hot chocolate souffle for course #5 was good, but nothing special. The sore point for me was the service - while certainly not overtly unfriendly, I found it needlessly uppity. Â Having been to several Michelin-starred restaurants in NYC and elsewhere, I understand that the service can be formal but it's usually *nice*! Â I didn't quite understand why the service at Bouley just left a bitter taste in my mouth. Â I probably wouldn't come back here for a special occasion.",1
4312,490,3,7/25/2014,"I really wanted to give more than just 3 stars but somehow it wasn't as hyped up as I would expect. I came here on my birthday for a lunch tasting menu with wine pairing. Very sophisticated and classy atmosphere. The decor was clean and simple, gave a bit of a Victorian feel. Men are required to wear a jacket so keep that in mind when making a reservation here. The service was good but definitely could've been better at a place that claims to be classy and respected. I wasn't too impress with the tasting menu, I guess I expected more; like better flavors and presentation, but it can all just be merely not my cup of tea. The wine was good but didn't exactly bring out any special flavors of the dish or compliment it to a point where I was in awe. The wine sommelier did a good job at explaining the wines in the beginning but then lack the descriptions of the wine for the remaining 2-3 dishes. One thing though, the restroom is a must visit for a restaurant like Bouley. Carpeted floors, dim lighting and a huge lounge area to freshen up before heading back out in the dining hall. A good place to visit once, but that's about it.",1
4313,490,5,7/25/2014,"I just returned from a 3 hour lunch at Bouley and I'm basically in tears because I already want to go back. Â This was probably one of the most perfect meals of my life, and having lived in NYC for a few years, that's no easy feat. For $55, the five course lunch tasting menu (plus an amuse bouche, unlimited bread, complimentary dessert bites and another bread surprise at the end of the meal) is a really good deal. Â I know you're probably thinking who the hell pays $55 for lunch but the experience and food are worth it if you're looking for a special something. Â  Every dish has dozens of very complex flavors that marry together perfectly, and the contrasting textures make for a unique sensory experience. Â Before our five courses came out, we were treated to an amuse bouche and the largest, most elaborate traveling bread basket I have ever seen. I will call it the brotherhood of the traveling baguettes. Â There are so many wonderful flavors and you can basically have as many slices as you want, all throughout your meal. While the bread is tasty, I advise against shoving as many slices into your face as possible. You'll get full quickly, like me, and have to unbutton your pants to move onto the main meal. To start, I had the chlorophyll soup, which sounds healthy but tastes divine. If kale always tasted this good, I'd line up to buy it by the bucket. Â I also tried my friend's tuna appetizer, and the foam underneath the tuna tasted like a sweet juicy apple that had transformed itself into a cotton candy bubble. Le sigh. Â  For course numero dos, we both had the porcini flan, as we couldn't pass it up. Â The complexity of flavors drove me mad! How do they fit so many flavors, so much warmth into a small dish? Mind blown. I had the chicken as my entree, which was cooked perfectly, which is rare for chicken. Â Light saucy broth, nothing too heavy, quite perfect. Then came round 1 of dessert. Â I ordered the coconut soup. Â This dish made me cry. Â It was so perfect. Â It gave me the sensation that I was sunbathing on a secluded beach in Phuket and drinking fresh coconut water. Round 2 was totally different but also earth shattering. Â I ordered the caramelized pear option, which was what I imagine the most decadently delicious French dessert would taste like. Â Of course I tried my friend's chocolate souffle. Â The tears continued. Â Total waterworks. Finally, they brough us mini desserts to go, which I couldn't bear to shove in my mouth, as I was so full and felt it would be disrespectful to so brazenly eat the dainty food without an appetite. Â  I'd like to live here. Â Mr. Bouley, please keep it up!",1
4314,490,5,7/24/2014,"After I was so disappoint with del posto, I feel reluctant Â to travel down town to try all restaurants, especially during hot summer. But my friend persisted that I should try bouley. Ok I did and I was so glad that I did. It was amazing. I had prix lunch for $55, seriously, I couldn't find a better way to spend my $55 in new york city. It was so worthy. The food was super delicious and I left very satisfied. Maybe a little too much food for me, I normally don't eat that much. They gave one extra complimentary course and also quite a few small desert pieces and even asked me if I wanted to pack them to bring home, at the end, when I was leaving. they even gave me a lemon loaf cake as chief's little gift. How nice they were. They really made me feel that they cared about their customers, even for the lunch , maybe it was not profitable for them, but they still keep high standard and offer the best. That truly moves me. Not like a lot of restaurants, they do as minimal as they can for lunch as it is not profitable. I think it is the best one michelin star restaurant to me so far.",1
4315,490,5,7/22/2014,"Bouley hosts one of the best lunch deals in the city: $55 for 5 courses. I had high expectations and the restaurant did not disappoint. The two of us ordered the prix fixe meal. The first set included the Blini of Scottish Smoked Salmon, Porcini Flan, Slow Braised Kobe Style Beef Cheeks, Strawberries with Amaretto ice cream, and the Hot Caramelized Anjou Pear. The second consisted of Big Eye Tuna, Organic Connecticut Farm Egg, Organic Long Island Duck, Chilled Coconut Soup, and the Valrhona Chocolate Souffle. All the dishes were delicious, especially the Porcini Flan, which was bursting with umami. Two amuse bouches were served, and a bread cart rolled around mid-meal. The cart's selections were great and the bread director is on hand to explain all the different types. All bread is baked in-house. This does not detract from my rating of the restaurant, but it seemed like truffle was a dominant flavor in many of the soups and sauces. I tasted it in four out of the ten dishes that we ordered (with four of those dishes being dessert). Not a problem for me, but if truffle is not up your alley or you're seeking more of a progression of flavors throughout the meal, this could be troublesome. The staff were quiet and respectful, and the decorations were beautiful. Not everyone likes fluffy cushions, dainty silverware, and chintz, but amidst the hustle and bustle of New York, I appreciated Bouley's attempt to create classic yet comfortable elegance.",1
4316,490,5,7/19/2014,One of the five best restaurants in the city. Â Lunch is spectacular and possibly THE best bargain in the city as well. Artfully prepared dishes with decent sized portions and impeccable service. Â The bread service alone is reason for a visit for all you carb lovers. Â The little gifts they send you put with is a special and thoughtful touch. Â Never heavy handed and dishes are uncommonly light for French cuisine - Bouley and Jean Georges are to me the epitome of what New French cuisine is all about...,1
4317,490,5,7/15/2014,"Outstanding service, food, and ambiance. This is definitely up there with Eleven Madison and Gramercy Tavern as one of my absolute favorite ""special occasion"" places in NYC. Beautiful restaurant and superb service, Bouley is the epitome of fine dining! Started out with a cream tomato soup amuse bouche that reminded me of gazpacho. Good but not my favorite. I had the tasting menu with the porcini flan, beef cheek gnocci, strawberries dessert, and caramelized pear. We ended lunch with the tray of chocolates and cookie petit fours. All were amazing-- it's hard to pick a favorite course because they were all on point. For $55, the lunch tasting menu is definitely the best deal",1

4320,490,4,7/6/2014,"I came with a group for lunch and had a fantastic meal. Shout out to the truffle cracker amuse bouche. What a delight! I didn't really try anything from the bread cart but wow what a selection. From the prix fixe I got the salmon blini, wild mushrooms, chicken, coconut soup and anjou pear. The mushrooms come in a good variety and the whole dish boasts a complex flavor profile, although a particular kind of mushroom was quite sandy. My favorite course is the chicken. It is the least hyped dish on Yelp out of all the entrees, but the meat is tender, and the flavor clean and healthy. For the palate cleanser most people who tried both preferred the rhubarb to the coconut. Definitely get the anjou pear for dessert. Very limited cocktail selection but extensive wine list!",1
4321,490,2,7/3/2014,"I must say, I don't know where to start. Well I guess when we entered. We were 3 guys and one female, and once we entered, we were scanned up and down. Then after being put in the holding area in front of the restaurant, we were escorted passed the upstairs dining room and down to the basement-- where we were put in a table away from everyone. The lady asked for a glass of wine when the menus came. That was ignored. Twenty minutes later--they realized we were still there. Their ignoring us was not successful. We stayed. What could they do but take our order? We were there to stay. Oh did I fail to mention that during the first 20 minutes waiting a party of six came in and was ushered to a table and given drinks right away. Well the ladies at the table were dressed in glitter so I guess the staff liked that. Also the other ladies were given a side table for their purse. Not our lady friend. Just put it on the floor for her. Well the service got a little better when they overheard us comparing their lackluster service to other restaurants that were more impressive. Dinner was ok. Â We did the tasting menu with wine pairing. Since we chose to do that we began to get more attention. Go figure. The tasting menu was ok. So after dinner I told the maÃ®tre'd and he gave me his email. So I emailed him, per his instruction, of my bad experience. He replied: ""Dear Nancy."" Â ""Who is Nancy?"", I replied. Well his response to me must have been cut and pasted because he was offering us a complimentary lunch for two. Well I told him we were four and unlike Nancy we had dinner... kind of felt bad for Nancy too. Now on a side note: if you cut and paste and are responding to a party who had 3 gay males at the table make sure you correct the name, especially if it's Nancy. Well as you can see, from the very beginning to the the very end, this place is a disaster. Spend your good money elsewhere!!! Â It's New York you can find another and be satisfied.",1

4323,490,2,6/30/2014,"I was taking a client out for dinner and was looking for a high end/memorable experience. Â Many people recommended Bouley and I was excited to get a reservation. Â The restaurant is beautiful. Â The decor, the art in the dining room, the quiet music made you feel like you were carried away to a destination far from a busy NYC neighborhood. Â The waitstaff was attentive. Â Once the food began to arrive, we were very underwhelmed. We decided that I would order the 6 course tasting menu and my client ordered an appetizer, an entree and a dessert. Â Our idea was to share all we ordered, so we could taste many different courses. Â Although we did do that, we were also told that ""Chef Bouley does not like people to share."" Â For the money that I was paying, Â I really did not care what the Chef thinks. Â The best part of the meal was the bread, which really was delicious. Â The rest of the courses were trying too hard and left both of us wondering...what is all the hype about. Â We both have eaten at many wonderful restaurants around the world and Bouley, although pretty, is not one of them. Â I would not return.",1
4324,490,1,6/27/2014,"I was so excited to dine at Bouley for my 50th Birthday yet quickly became disappointed as soon as I sat down. Â The upholstered seats were stained, the waiter was rude to one of our Vegetarian diners who needed guidance and each course of the Tasting Menu had recurring flavors of Saffron and Truffle throughout the meal. Â The fish was very salty and fishy. This was the consensus for all 5 of us. Â Before I wrote this review, I did reach out to the Manager, Manuel who gave me a song and dance about how they close for a week to clean the upholstery. That is NO excuse for dirty seats for everyone dining until then???? He also said he ""informed"" our wait staff about the rudeness. Â That's it - just informed not addressed on how he could have treated the diner with more care. Â  Â  Manuel suggested I come dine again at the restaurant to give it another try. Â Really?!!! Why spend that kind of money on a very bad experience. Â For those of you thinking of dining at Bouley, if you want superb bread and wine then go for it. Otherwise, move on to another restaurant -- there are plenty of choices that offer delicious food, accommodating, enthusiastic staff and clean seating. Â  Forks down for this one!",1
2069,490,5,6/23/2014,"I will never step into a michelin star restaurant without any deal or celebration.. With that being said, my family came and visit me in NYC for a week.. It's my both of my brothers' bd week so I decided to take them to Bouley for lunch.. They require gentlemen to put on a jacket.. My dad and brothers did not have one since they are on vacation.. They have jackets there available for free.. Upon entering, I already fall in love with the decor.. They decorate the walls with apples and it looks more like an old cozy house, family restaurant.. We were seated and then the waiter brought us wine list.. They do offer wine pairing which I really recommend you to do.. It's 110 with the tasting menu... I did not do it since it was an afternoon and I have to bring my family around.. I am not going to write an extremely long review.. 55 dollars for lunch is really worth it.. They compliment us with a welcome dish.. It was asparagus and some puree I don't remember.. Below are a few highlights: 1) BREAD - they have a cart that's full with bread.. they will push towards your table and explain it to you.. all the breads are baked fresh and you choose which one you want... I tasted the apricot walnut, pistachio, and also the current.. They are all delicious.. 2) Porcini flan (something like that).. it was the 2nd course.. my favorite so far.. it tasted like chinese ""shark fin soup"".. accept that it's crab meat.. they serve REAL crab meat ok!!! Every scoop that I take is full with crab meat.. Mmmm.. The black truffle makes the texture a little thicker and it was delicious 3) Blini of Scottish Smoke salmon (1st course).. 2nd favorite.. you basically eat it with your hands.. smoke salmon in between 2 pieces of apple?? I don't remember.. But it's interesting.. 4) organic long island duck.. The duck was cooked medium and it was tender and perfect.. my brother ordered it and i think it's better than the beef I ordered.. I told them it was my brothers' bd.. I thought they will just put a candle on top of the dessert they ordered.. They actually comp us 2 dessert.. I love the peach dessert they comp us.. I had way too much and I don't remember what's the name called.. This is one of the Michelin restaurant that I felt full and bloated after 5 course meal.. They also comp us some chocolates at the end.. I won't reject chocolate but I just couldn't eat anymore!!! Thanks Bouley for giving my family a wonderful time!!! :)",1

Came to see what was the food trend, my mom and i went for the $55 tasting of menu. Everything was great, the servers were super knowledgeable about the menu. The salmon blini was by far my favorite dish, all the flavors went well with each other. The wine selection was superb also.

Also take a peek at the kitchen, the ""line"" is pristine and modern, and they are generally happy to show you around! Chef Bouley is also a working chef, so more than not you will see him in the kitchen and not galavanting as a celebrity, which I find nice.",1
4327,490,5,6/18/2014,"I would give this place 10 stars if I could. Bouley was probably (tied with L'Atelier in London) the best dining experience I have ever had. From the minute I walked in to the minute I left - it is above and beyond in every way. My sister-in-law LOVES Bouley and comes here every year for her birthday. And after hearing about each phenomenal experience, I decided it's about time I stopped living vicariously through her, and eat here myself! We were not able to get a dinner reservation, but we managed to get one for lunch on Friday at 2:00pm. We opened the door to the restaurant, and was immediately greeted by the overwhelmingly beautiful smell of fresh apples. The entire room is filled with apples. The room is STUNNING! It's just gorgeous, the colors, furnishings, decor, everything makes you feel like you have stepped into a different time and different country. We were greeted by a hostess who informed us that Bob did need to wear a jacket, and she very happily provided one for him. We were INCREDIBLY under dressed for this place. Even for lunch - we were WAY under dressed. I'm not saying you need to wear a suit, but you definitely need to wear something other than a maxi dress and flip flops (if you're a girl). I literally felt like I was an embarrassment to the establishment. Now, no one else seemed to mind, but I sure did. After overcoming my fit of shame, Bob and I decided to do the tasting menu for lunch. For $55, you get 5 courses of exceptional food. That to me, is absurd. How can it be this cheap?! I could go to Macaroni Grill and spend that much money on stuff that literally comes frozen in a box. Sad. All I have to say about my entire meal was that it was delectable, exciting, interesting and most of all tremendously delicious. Whether it was the porcini flan with dungeness crab or the Long Island duck with golden Nevada dates or the hot Valrhona chocolate souffle - every single bite, crumb, piece and foam bubble was outstanding. And to rival this level of food, the service was every bit as good. And as the cherry on top, the entire restaurant is breathtakingly gorgeous. If you have the opportunity and the inclination to while away a few hours eating this lovely food - why wouldn't you come here? This establishment is truly a feast for the senses!",1

The decor was also beautiful w a spa like ambiance. fyi, men have to wear a coat. we were able to borrow one. We were surprisingly full and didn't eat much the rest of the day. **Though they say they cater to allergies and ask u about them, im not sure they really monitor it as i ended up ordering several items off the tasting menu that i was intolerant/sensitive to. Enjoyed the chlorophyll soup, flan porcini, long island duck, anjou pear dessert. A bread cart goes around w 10+ types of bread and i really liked the buckwheat, cherries, pistachio. I also loved the apple raisin bread at the beginning.",1

I had a foie gras (perfectly seared), sea urchin (great presentation) with apple gelee (amazing flavor), and lobster in almond milk. Service was excellent. Then we met with Chef Bouley who was kind, and interested and a great host as well. Over all an excellent experience and not as pricey at some of the other restaurants in this caliber.",1
4329,490,5,6/16/2014,"I finally had the chance to go to Bouley when I arranged to treat my mom to her birthday lunch. It was pretty simple to make a reservation via Open Table. We all got the tasting menu which had great value at $55 and a lot of choices. For amuse bouche, we first got this amazing potato and truffle on gluten free bread as well as a Course 1: The salmon blini was probably my favorite dish of the entire meal. The blini had the feel of a marshmallow, so airy and light, and I liked how the flavor of the roe would burst in my mouth. The chlorophyll blast soup was unexpectedly delicious and the big eye tuna was extremely fresh. Course 2: I remember really wanting to get the connecticut farm egg in my preparation to go to Bouley. It was good but not spectacular. My mom liked her porcini flan a lot. Course 3: Beef cheeks were too heavy for me and my sister said her duck was a bit too dry. My mom's salmon was classic and tasty. Course 4: We all got the strawberries and ice cream, which was a nice palate cleanser. Course 5: The chocolate souffle with coffee ice cream was definitely one of my favorite dishes. The restaurant also gave my mom a complimentary dessert with a happy birthday message and candle, which was very sweet. We received a few other side dishes compliments of the chef, which were really good and a nice surprise. My sister even said these were her favorite. The staff at Bouley were so friendly and would joke around with us, making it a very enjoyable experience. Don't forget to take advantage of the bread man too!

4330,490,5,6/14/2014,"My fiancÃ© took me here right after we got engaged, and it was a meal I'll never forget! From the second you walk in the door, you're treated like royalty. The decor is beautiful and elegant, and so unique. It looks something like what I would imagine Buckingham Palace to look like on the inside. My fiancee and I did the six course tasting menu, and each course was outstanding. I'm vegetarian (he is not) and we were both equally impressed. They were quick to accommodate my dietary restrictions and I'm sure they would do the same for anyone who is vegan or gluten-free, too. I ate so many things I could not even explain, nor have any idea what they were...but they were great. The service is such that you'll have about five waiters tending to your every need, but somehow they manage to strike the perfect balance of being attentive but not overbearing. There's even someone whose job is solely to push around a cart of bread brandishing about 20 different kinds of artisan breads (including several gluten-free options). Plus, when you leave the restaurant they'll give you a goody bag of those breads (of your choice) and chocolates. This is a super special occasion place...a meal that you'll remember for the rest of your life!",1
4331,490,3,6/13/2014,"We were regulars at the original Bouley some 20 years ago, and had the same impression as most everyone else, that it was the best restaurant in New York. Since then, we have tried each of its incarnations a couple of times, the current restaurant twice over a period of the last three years. The decor is fine, the service is fine, the attitude is fine, the house wines are fine. However, the food is not great or even very good, just good, and that includes the famous breads. There are two possible explanations for this impression. One is that in the past couple of decades we have eaten some dozens of dinners at Michelin three-star restaurants in France and Spain, and our tastes have become more educated. The other is that this restaurant has gone down. In any event, if we were to rate it on our Michelin scale, it would be one star, and about 24 on the Zagat scale.",1
4332,490,5,6/9/2014,"Loved everything about Bouley! I thought the decor was elegant and warm and reminded me of dinner at home not a restaurant. Â Although my at home meals usually don't include five star service and truffles. Â We opted to order off the regular menu not the tasting. Â We ordered 3 courses but I felt like we had five. Â Our first taste-the amouche Bouche was a rhubarb froth with lobster and a crema all delightful and a cracker with a crema and truffles. Â I could have eaten another one it was so tasty and delicious. Â Needless to say my appetite was anxious to try something else. Â I couldn't wait for the porcini flan and forager mushrooms to arrive. Â Amazing and yes more truffle on top! Â Lots of crab and a earthy porcini flavor. Â The forager mushrooms were perfectly executed and might have been some of the tastiest mushrooms I've ever eaten. Â We moved along to our entrees of Colorado lamb and Long Island duck. Â The lamb was tasty and tender and the three sauces were all different but delicious. Â I loved the mint it complimented the lamb perfectly. Â The duck breast was cooked perfectly but and the compliments on the plate added the wow factor. Â It was served over a fig purÃ©e with duck prosciutto. Â The side of vanilla bean fingerling potato purÃ©e was so unique and different and we loved it. It was my birthday so you know I was getting dessert! What I didn't know was I would be having three. Â We ordered our dessert and were greeted by a coconut soup to cleanse our palette followed by my chocolate soufflÃ© and my fiancÃ©'s flan. Â The soufflÃ© was perfect! Â The waiter then came over with another treat! A birthday parfait with amaretto ice cream and fresh fruit. Â I was stuffed, but Bouley wanted to feed me more with a tray of Petit fours. Little rich chocolates. Â  The wine list was exceptional! It was pricey but well worth it if you enjoy gourmet food well executed! Â  Oh yeah lemon pound cake to enjoy for breakfast the next day when we left!",1
4333,490,5,6/6/2014,"We had the perfect dinner at Bouley. All the dishes were delicious and refined. The food was simple yet innovative (I absolutely loved the black truffle cracker amuse bouche, some pictures in my instagram: LorainneMarie)! I ordered the shrimp and scallops appetizer, and it was the best seafood dish I've ever had. It was served with alaska live dungeness crab and calamari in an ocean herbal broth. The seafood was cooked perfectly and all the flavors well-complemented each other. My date ordered the foie gras, which was perfect! Very silky and well-seasoned, I will definitely order that next time! I had the sirloin for the entree and it was juicy and well-seasoned! However, I preferred my date's lamb entree, which was more flavorful and beautifully plated. Ultimately, the small touches on the side made the dinner extra special. For instance, they offered 10-12 different types of homemade bread (the pistachio and olives were my favorite!) that were sliced from the loaf right in front of you; they served 3 different amuse bouche throughout the dinner; they had a nice, romantic atmosphere and comfy (couple?) balcony seats; and the they gave us loaves of pineapple tea cakes as a parting gift. I will definitely go back for my next special occasion.",1
4334,490,5,6/2/2014,I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Bouley. Â I have been here a few times now and it always surpassed my expectations. Â The service is always impeccable and the food is amazing. Â The staff really goes out of their way to ensure that you have a lovely dining experience.,1
4335,490,2,6/2/2014,"We had dinner here last week and it was not an experience I want to repeat. The food is ok for the type of restaurant and price point. Nothing surprising and well executed enough. There are just so many restaurants in New York that can equal or exceed their food preparation that it is not worth going back to deal with the service issues. Obviously the restaurant is more formal than most are these days I eat in the best restaurants but I also like to be comfortable and Bouley is more like going to your great aunt's house and being told not to embarrass the family. The average age of the patrons was dead. We had the wine pairings with the tasting meal. Because I have a seafood allergy I had a couple of courses different from my dining companion. They could not seem to get right who was having what and a couple of times we had to switch glasses. One time we were given a wine for a course and after consuming 90% of it were told that the wine was for the next course as well. Another time we were given the food and had to wait 5 minutes for the new round of glasses and wine while the food got cold. That was easy enough to happen as several of the dishes were only lukewarm. Finally, the waiter pulled out the table to allow my dining companion back in after visiting the restroom and sent the flowers off the table, breaking the vase with shards flying around and splashing me with water. He then stood there trying to pat dry the table until the Maitre d finally came by to move us to another table. When I said to the Maitre d after dinner that there were several service glitches his response was ""well that's good to know."" It may also be good for him to know that I will take my business elsewhere.",1
2289,490,4,6/1/2014,"Bouley definitely tries out inventive combinations of flavors for its dishes, but not all of the dishes we had as part of the (fairly reasonably priced) prix fixe were well-balanced, tasty, or memorable. The cocktails were also alright but not particularly memorable either. The food itself would've probably been a 3-star level, especially given the stiff competition in this category of restaurants, but the bread cart is a really unique touch. A bread connoisseur explains what all the breads are, and you can really tell that he's passionate about his art; all the breads we tried (and you can try multiple) were amazing. Service is excellent as you'd expect, and as other reviews point out the decor is pretty trippy - it's almost a self-aware, ironic stuffiness that works well.",1
4336,490,5,5/31/2014,"*4.5 stars We waited a little bit in the opulent waiting room with cute chairs and strong drinks. Then we were seated at a table for four even though there were only two of us but they seated us on the same side, which was perfect - loved this! I can't remember any other restaurant doing this. The place felt like a castle especially downstairs. The food was mostly fantastic as we opted for the tasting with the Kobe beef supplement (+$50). The bread here is fantastic. I tasted almost every single choice (saffron infused brioche and the regular brioche were my favorites). I was so stuffed when I left. Food: CanapÃ©s: truffle on cracker and lobster on rhubarb foam/yogurt(? Consistency was somewhere in the middle). The warm truffle on the chip was decent and the chilled lobster tasted good but I could have done without everything underneath the lobster. Sea urchin with caviar and sweet chilled citrusy flavors: this came in a sea urchin shell and was so delicious. Mmmmm. Oysters: very good as well but the sweet citrusy ingredients overpowered the taste of the oyster a bit. Porcini flan with lobster and tofu: so delicious Lobster with asparagus and other veggies: lobster was very good but I didn't really care for the other stuff in there John Dory monkfish: delicious especially with the pesto sauce Kobe beef: 3 small pieces but oh so fatty, tender, juicy, and delicious. Wow. Roasted lamb: this was ok. Coconut soup: soooooo good Huckleberry soup: good palette cleanser Amaretto flan with ice cream: flan was very good Pineapple: ehh. This tasted kind of weird. I wouldn't order this again.",1
4337,490,4,5/30/2014,A very classy restaurant. Â Food and services are superb. Â We will be back :) Had to deduct 1 star for all the dead floral arrangements throughout the restaurant.,1
4338,490,5,5/26/2014,"An epicurean delight; best restaurant in NYC hands down. The menu is a chow hound's delight. Super amazing! The ambience. The interior decorating. The service was beyond impeccable. The food...can't even begin to describe the Porcini Flan, the soups, the duck, the desserts. Stellar!",1
4339,490,5,5/25/2014,"Words cannot describe my experience at Bouley. Â From the great selection of wine, to the attentive staff, and the succulent dishes....Bouley has won my heart...",1
4340,490,4,5/19/2014,"I came here with a friend and we ordered different dishes for each course on the tasting menu so we could try as many dishes as possible. Â The standouts for were wild mushrooms, porcini flan, and the farm egg. Â The chocolate souffle is also pretty delicious. Â Like any proper french restaurant, it relies a lot on truffles and butter to create umami, and you really cant go wrong with that combo! Also, the bread cart was awesome... the garlic bread was slightly addictive.",1
4341,490,5,5/16/2014,Love it. Everything from starter to dessert,1
4342,490,2,5/12/2014,"We went here for an early dinner on Mother's day and had a very disappointing experience. We were required to get the $145 pp tasting menu. Although things started out well with delicious bread and fabulous service, this changed as the restaurant got busier. The food was unimpressive and lacked flavor. The last entree course was brought and no mention was made that the chef has substituted parts of the dish (for example, I ordered lamb with gnocci and instead got risotto). When we eventually found our server to ask about this, he offered to bring some gnocchi but was not apologetic and brushed it off. This is not the type of service expected for such an expensive meal. Lastly, the whole staff had a very pretentious attitude. We asked for a ""reasonable"" red wine and were direct to a $230 bottle by the sommelier. They also charged us $70 for 10 bottles of sparkling water. Clearly, we can afford to eat there but that doesn't mean I like to throw away money. Will definately not return.",1
4343,490,1,5/6/2014,"What happened with this place? From its past glory the only thing that remains is the high prices. Â We had a reservation for 5:30 but were not seated until about 15 minutes because the main dining room was still being set up. The evening went downhill from here. The entrees and desserts were mediocre at best -- neither the flavors nor the presentation warrant the exorbitant prices. The only redeeming quality was the bread which was great. The worst part about the dining experience was the service. Â I have been to a number of French restaurants in both France and NYC and had never encountered such poor service. Â Not only did our main waiter not know that he needs to take away the decorative plates when bread is served, but consistently kept making snarky remarks. Â Note to manager: upscale service does not equal rudeness, and one cannot claim to be upscale if your servers do not know basic tenents of service and food presentation. The same waiter was bullying other tables into ordering additional pre-dinner drinks and expressed great displeasure if none was ordered. To top it all, two additional items that we had not ordered miraculously found their way into our bill -- had I noticed them, we would have been charged $50 more for things we never ordered. A half-apology is all we got for this mistake. If you care more about your actual dining experience than about prestige or Zagat's ratings, do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. The Landmarc and the Greek in the vicinity both offer a superior experience both in terms of cuisine and service.",1
4344,490,2,5/5/2014,"The food at Bouley was great, which at $175 per person for the tasting menu, it ought to be. The service however, was terrible. We were made to feel like we didn't belong, after being seated at a 2-top table behind a wall, where the previous guest had discarded their dessert pate on a decorative table carrying flowers, that we were left to find. We were celebrating our 2 year anniversary and both dressed to the nines in designer tuxedos, hoping to have a really remarkable evening. We were left for long periods with empty glasses, and twice asked by different servers for orders we had already given to someone else. There was an overwhelming feeling that we were forgotten and somewhat unwanted at times. Â After the meal, the complimentary gift of a pastry to take with you that we saw others receive as we arrived, was not offered to us. No one said thank you, no one asked if we'd enjoyed ourselves. And this, after the bill with tip cost us more than $700. It is a true shame to leave a special occasion meal with so much lighter a wallet and feel marginalized.",1
4345,490,4,5/3/2014,"I found the place by researching for best lunch prix fix deal among Michelin starred restaurants in NYC. Not all Michelin starred restaurant offer lunch and not all offers prix fix. Bouley offers a 6 course tasting menu for $55. For me, that's a steal! They have 3-4 options per course that you can pick from. My favorite appetizer was salmon roe sandwich. It was their take/ twist on salmon, bagel cream cheese. My entree was duck. It was good. We were really full at the end of the meal. Another high point was the bread cart with 8-10 selection of bread. They also recommended us which bread to try given the food that we selected. Overall, it was a really good experience. We also got a loaf of bread to take home complementary from the chef. The loaf was big ~6 inches. (Definitely $55 well spent at a michelin starred restaurant). They also have a huge selection of wine (bottle) at different price points",1
4346,490,1,4/30/2014,"I HATED Bouley. Hated nearly everything about it. The food: The porcini flan was more like spit soup and was loaded with crab shells, the rabbit salad was bland and boring. The venison was cooked well but they put so much vanilla on everything that's all you could taste, vanilla venison (Actually it tasted like vanilla banana venison-gross). The lobster was boring, bland, again, under-seasoned. My husband who works within the restaurant industry said it reminded him of culinary school experiments. Nothing was seasoned; we had to salt everything that came to the table. The service: THE WORST. We expected so much more. The wait staff was unable to articulate the components in the dishes and describe them accurately. Beyond that, I had specified with no uncertainty at the beginning of the meal, that I DO NOT EAT FISH. NO FISH. I do however, eat shellfish. So, what comes my way? A little slab of John Dory. I sent it back. I don't eat fish. A painfully obnoxious waiter (tall, very slim) returned with an egg dish (which was tasty, and seasoned, just simple French eggs) and exasperatedly exclaimed: ""we haven't given up - we're trying again with you."" Suggesting that I was being difficult. SO RUDE. The Sommelier and the bread cart man were perfectly nice and accommodating. It was the two waiters that took care of us who were problematic. The redeemable things: -Their bread is excellent, wonderful even. -The room- while each component of the space is quite ugly (the velvet frames, the floral motifs, the paintings, the ridiculous looking vases) it all comes together in a bizarre way that works and is comfortable. -The wine, I took a 2010 Minervois for $130 that I thought was reasonable. It was fabulous. So, $500 later for two of us, we leave, disappointed, miserable, so sad to have had this experience. I should have known better, I disliked my meal at Brushstroke too. But at least there, the service was on point. Bouley- I'm not a fan.",1
4347,490,4,4/30/2014,"My most favorite part of this restaurant is the front room lined with rows and rows of apples that emit such a fragrant apple aroma. The service was on par but the staff was a bit stiff. The food was delicious! This restaurant made me feel like I was in another country, time and place!",1
4348,490,5,4/29/2014,"No wondering..It definitely should be more than one Mechlin star!!! Fabulous decorations and elegant dishes. This restaurant is my favorite, among all others in the same level. I would say, for the restaurant atmosphere only, it could be considered as 3 stars. I know other people gave long and great reviews for this restaurant, but I have only one (but important) sentence to write in my review. Do the tasting menu!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No regret..!",1
4349,490,4,4/23/2014,"Overall, I had a great meal here and would recommend the Lunch Tasting Menu (5 course) as not only a great deal, but a great opportunity to eat some beautifully prepared fish. Â The service was attentive and professional but lacked a certain je ne sais quoi in terms of warmth? Â Or perhaps a better description would be it was very traditional fancy restaurant service. Â  -Amuse Bouche Mushroom truffle on cracker had great flavor and was a joy to eat. Blood orange foam with burratta cheese, I loved this and could eat a vat of it. Â The blood orange foam was extremely refreshing and a great pairing with the richness of the cheese. 1- Big Tuna in Lemon foam Â The tuna pieces were juicy and flavorful but I wasn't a fan of this dish. Â I found the lemon foam to be too over powering in the dish. Smoked salmon belini - If you enjoy smoked salmon, you'll love this dish, the belini is so delicate it melts in your mouth and the flavor of the smoked salmon takes over every bite. 2- Dungeness Crab in porcini Flan Â Outstanding. Â I am not a lover of crab in general, but this dish is wonderful. Â The Porcini mushroom flan is very flavorful without over powering the crab, which is so delicate and a true pleasure to eat. 3- Fish Replacement to Meat course Â This was my favorite course. Â I requested a fish substitution because I do not eat meat and I was presented with sea bass wrapped in scallops on top of risotto in a saffron sauce. Â This is probably one of the best seafood entrees I have ever eaten. Â The sea bass was cooked perfectly and incredibly flavorful. Â I usual shy away from scallops, but the scallops on top of the sea bass made the dish. Â As this was a substitution I'm not sure if it is usually on the regular menu, but if it is order it! 4- Coconut soup Â This was ok, I think I liked the second option better, the strawberries with amaretto gelato 5- Pear desert Â This was really good; I especially enjoyed how thinly the pear was sliced. In my opinion there was way too much desert in this meal. Â I would have preferred a salad course over the first desert course. Â As for the infamous bread trolley, I tried sourdough, olive, brioche, pistachio/hazelnut, apricot brioche, and French garlic and thought they were ok; nothing to write home about and I definitely know my way around a bread trolley.",1
4350,490,5,4/20/2014,"You walk through the main door into an atrium, walls covered with fresh apples, the scent fills the air. Then step into the lounge to await your table. More like the sitting room from 1900's, elegant and charming. The dining room is tasteful and formal. The staff are attentive, friendly and helpful. The 6 course menu was delicious and with amazing presentation, the bread even came on a trolley! I really can't fault anything. Of course this comes with a price and this is not for the faint hearted!",1
4351,490,4,4/15/2014,"Despite a brief period of closure and then relocation, David Bouley's one Michelin star restaurant has (one could arguably say) been in an inauspicious corner in TriBeCa for nearly 15 years [1]. The constant stream of positive reviews and a tempting menu proved to be quite the tease... until an upcoming President's Day afforded me the chance to take a lengthy ""lunch break"" on a Tuesday afternoon. The entrance to Bouley is one of the most unique in NYC as the light, yet distinct scent of apples serves to greet every guest. The rows and rows of apples make for quite a visual as well; unfortunately, from what I learned, they can only keep for a week or so, until they get thrown out. After our group had all gathered, we were led into the Red Room, one of the downstairs dining areas that also doubles up as a venue for private events in some occasions. As its name suggests, the room is painted in a deep red, maroon color; at night, I'm sure it transforms into one of the most romantic ambiances. After being given menus, which we needed only a quick glance at, we were ready to begin the meal. To start off, we were given various amuses, the highlight of which was a kudzu crisp, a dash of aligot, and several shavings of black truffle in one bite. It was quite the segue into our first courses, for which I had asked for the Organic Farm Egg, a dish normally offered as a second course. It was an adjustment I was happy to have asked for, however, as this dish features some of my favorite ingredients. Artichokes and sunchokes are folded into a creamy steamed polenta and layered with strips of Serrano Ham. The final touches, an aromatic coconut-garlic broth and a perfectly poached egg in the center of the dish, made for one of my favorite dishes of the meal. In a close second was the Porcini Flan, another signature dish at Bouley. Although I wouldn't entirely agree with our server's description of it as a chawanmushi (there's nothing remotely custard-like about it), it's a delicate utilization of Alaska Dungeoness Crab against a black truffle dashi. The flavors are well balanced and surprisingly clean, and the broth, gelatinous in texture with hints of yuzu and spice, make for an unforgettable spoonful. Perhaps the first two dishes were so perfect that the rest of the courses couldn't outshine them. I, and almost all of my friends, ordered the Long Island Duck as our third course. The duck was sliced a little too thinly for my liking, and came doused in a gravy-like sauce; a choice which, at least in my opinion, sacrificed some of the integrity of the protein. A small smear of polenta and a somewhat out-of-place confit of clementines accompanied the dish, and unfortunately didn't add much. Thankfully, an interlude of a ""Coconut Soup"", a scoop of coconut sorbet paired with pieces of crystallized pineapple, shortly followed, and let us know that dessert was on the way. I had gone with the Hot Caramelized Anjou Pear, a dessert featuring carefully layered slices of caramelized pear around a biscuit Breton. With a drizzle of hot toffee sauce and a side of Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream, it becomes an edible exercise in opposites; of texture, ranging from the crisp biscuit shell to the malleable fold of pear and ice cream; flavors, playing the bright vanilla ice cream against the heavier, denser toffee; and temperature. Was this five-course meal worth the $55? Absolutely. It's a much better value than Bouley's dinner tastings, and there are few other places that offer an exquisite meal for a comparable price. While there were certainly some parts of the meal that outshone others, Bouley is, unarguably, one of the best restaurants to be found in NYC. -- [1] Bouley's original restaurant operated between 1987-1996. He later reopened (the current Bouley) across the street from the original location over a decade later. [2] Bread is sliced to order from their Chariot de Pain; varieties include the the typical sourdough, olive, and fig as well as pistachio hazelnut, saffron walnut, and black current anise.",1

We actually came here because we were given a large gift certificate by a family member, by the definitely didn't discriminate against us the way others might.

My wife and I will be dreaming of perfectly sliced bread today.",1
4353,490,5,4/10/2014,"My boyfriend and I brought my mom and dad to this restaurant for my mom's birthday. I was quite honor to give them such a wonderful Â dining experience. The decor was luxurious which gives the impression that you are taking part of something special. The staff were all very gracious, and the table service we had was one of the best I have ever experienced in my life. The tasting menu was delicious, even my parents who are not so used to eating ""foreign"" cuisine really enjoyed themselves. The dessert was truly Â most special, just a perfect ending to such a special eating experience. One of the things I love most about fine-dinning experience is when dishes are coordinated to be placed on the table for everyone at the same time.

4354,490,5,4/7/2014,"The entrance was whimsically decorated with lots of apples. Beautiful high ceilings & flowing drapery welcomes you to a wonderful ambience. The menu was well punctuated with a very nice series of Amuse Bouche, bread service & sommeliers to assist.",1
4355,490,5,4/3/2014,"I love this restaurant in New York City. 5 stars are not enough to review this restaurant. I have been there only twice for special occasions about 5 years ago. It is not affordable for me, plus I see they raised the price of tasting menu, so it is hard to go back there again, but I am desperately want to go back there. Lunch during week is much cheaper than dinner time, so someday when I can take off from work, I will go there. Their food is amazing! I ordered chef's tasting menu both time I went there. Food cooked with fresh ingredients served artistically on plates and amuse your eyes. Then, when I ate it, I felt like different ingredients met in your mouth and played music in my mouth. Moreover, they serve amuse bouche and cute small sweets complementary. Wait staff's attitude is very professional. When I went there for a birthday celebration, a waiter saw us looking a a birthday card Â and brought a piece of cake with a candle although we didn't ask for it. What a wonderful service! After we ate amazing food and finished the payment, still our amazing experience had not finished yet. As we walked to the exit, they gave us bread which their bakery made. I was surprised by their great service.",1
4356,490,3,4/2/2014,"There were only meats for entree. We ordered 4 different meats, and none of them was excellent. I liked appetizer though.",1
4357,490,5,3/4/2014,"This is review is for the lunch tasting menu I had high expectations coming in and Bouley's luncheon tasting menu absolutely blew my mind. Yes, it did end up being $100 for lunch (including wine) but I wouldn't think twice before forking over another $100 to come back. Make sure you have a good 3 hrs to spend though! Bouley is the perfect blend of sophistication, simplicity and beautiful flavors. If you're a fan a truffle, you're in for a treat since pretty much every dish is elevated with truffle. Big Eye Tuna - prepared as a tuna tartare on foam. The tuna was fresh but I was more impressed by the foam. It had a beautiful texture and actually added to the dish instead of most places that just put foam on to make stuff seem more fancy-pants. Forager's Treasure of Wild Mushroom VS. Porcini Flan - I had a hard time debating between these two options so I shared with a friend. These two are both amazing dishes and I still can't decide which one I like better. It just depends on your mood. The Flan is more rich with decadent flavors. The mushrooms had a wonderful earthy taste that you don't get in most mushrooms. They tasted like they were plucked fresh from a magical forest...both amazing dishes Slow Braised Kobe Style Beef Cheeks - the beef just melts so no knife required. It also comes with a nice small side of mashed potatoes that was nice to dip the beef in Dessert - I actually had to run to a meeting so I missed dessert Wine - the Cote du Rhone was really reasonably priced, went well with the tasting menu, and most importantly, delicious--low tannins, nice acidity, great soft finish. And they also have a super fun bread cart that they push around with about 20 different types of bread. I've never seen such a crazy selection. Overall, great, great value for lunch!",1
4358,490,3,2/24/2014,"I recently traveled to New York with my family and Bouley was one of the two restaurants I was privileged to eat at. I say privileged because it is renowned for some of the best cuisine in NYC. And while the experience was for the most part positive, there were a few things that stood out to me. First, our table was located directly in front of the hallway connecting the kitchen to the dining area. This resulted in a constant flow of waiters and other staff. Second, the cheese cart was in close proximity to our table for the duration of our meal. So close that I was constantly catching whiffs of pungent cheese. Fortunately I love cheese, but I could see this being an off-putting issue for others. The wait staff was a bit reserved while serving, but had no problem bickering among themselves within hearing distance. What about the cuisine you ask? Many of the dishes were exemplary. The mushrooms with a decadent piece of toro stand out as a particular triumph of flavors. However, while my duck entrÃ©e was cooked perfectly, all of the corresponding flavor components were a redundancy of sweetness. The other members of my family ordered the braised beef cheeks, which I can say were far superior. This was my second time at Bouley and my conclusion is much the same. The dÃ©cor is exquisite and the food is delicious. But as a patron I never feel entirely valued. Perhaps as I said in the beginning of this review, I am privileged to eat the cuisine. However, acknowledging the symbiotic relationship of patron and establishment would do far more for their cause than caviar and truffles.",1
3707,490,3,2/23/2014,"After reading such great reviews for this place I was actually very underwhelmed and disappointed. The service was not terrible but not what I would expect from such a highly rated michelin star restaurant. Twice the waitress forgot utensils and we waited about 30minutes just for the check. I thought I was spoiled from recently dining at EMP but for the mark up of this meal we shouldn't have to wait so long just for a check. However, I have to say the porcini flan was amazing and they have one of the most unique bread selections I've ever seen at a restaurant.",1
4359,490,3,2/21/2014,"Meh. $900 later and that is how I feel. Â Not that I'm complaining about the price (I knew what I signed up for) but, for that much, I dunno - I expect more. Â The food was... interesting? Â Somehow combining savory and ""huh?"" Â It just seemed like an incomplete thought... that, or just half-assed. Â Either way, not great. It seems like a place where people would go who didn't know any better. Â They want to go to a great place and they think that the most expensive is the best (which can sometimes be true and often be false) and they capitalize on that. Â ""You idiots don't know what good food tastes like, so here are some flavors you never tasted before - it's not necessarily good but we're banking on you thinking it is because you don't know any better."" The waitstaff was good but not amazing. Â They were super quiet, you could hardly hear them - I think they were whispering to mess with me (not really). The only saving grace of dinner was the wine - which was excellent. Everything else was... well... meh. Â  If you're spending big in NYC - there are plenty of better places to do so... IMO",1
4360,490,5,2/19/2014,"AMAZING. The food, the atmosphere...everything. I love all the courses, especially the shredded crab meat, the lamb, the foie gras, and the wagyu beef with green risotto. The appetizers are really really good. I find the potato with caviar dibs decent, but the mushroom with tuna dibs amazing! The desserts are fantastic! One of them taste like an actual cloud!!! OMG it's so good! The other one had pretty decorations--it's coffee lava cake with ice cream.",1
4361,490,5,2/17/2014,"I have had the lunch prix fixe here approximately three times now, and don't have a single bad thing to say about it. I find the decor charming rather than uptight or stuffy, and I love the smell of apples that permeates the foyer. As many others have said, the prix fixe is a relatively good deal, in the sense that you can eat enough to be stuffed, with very high quality food, for only $55++! I love the porcini flan, every mouthful is to be treasured for its punch of umami and nugget of crab. I'm trying to figure out a way to justify coming here for dinner...especially the $175 tasting menu...if I can wean myself off my fatty tuna and uni addiction. Maybe my anniversary? Stay tuned for the review update once that happens...!",1
4362,490,5,2/16/2014,"Bouley is one of my favorite restaurants, ever. I adore the foyer entrance--a wall lined with fresh apples, filling the space with sweet scent. The dining area is very warm and inviting. It feels cozy yet luxuriously elegant with velvety plush chairs, candle lighting, and oriental rugs. From the amuse-bouche to the in house baked artisan bread cart to the fresh silverware sets between courses, you will be spoiled with extraordinary food and service. The luncheon tasting menu is humbly generous, with five divine courses of fancy, delicate French cuisine for $55. I highly recommend the foie gras, Connecticut egg, and duck as they are some of the best dishes I've ever eaten. It's truly an incredible culinary affair, so allot yourself at least two hours to thoroughly enjoy your fine dining experience.",1
4363,490,5,2/15/2014,"The tasting menu at lunch is your best bang for your buck. The food here is delicious, attractive, and inspiring! And their homemade bread? To die for!! This place is a must!",1
4364,490,3,2/13/2014,"Maybe I just don't get it, but I was not impressed with this place. We had the lunch tasting menu ($55/each). It was okay, nothing amazing that I just have to rave about. The service was great, very attentive and I was also happy with the wine selection; the food did nothing to impress me.",1
4365,490,5,2/12/2014,"1 Michelin Star.... Chef Bouley 5 courses for $55 for lunch. Â That says it all. I loved the entrance of Bouley. Â It was cute and different with all the arrangement of apples. Â The venue itself and its staff screams out elegance. Â Don't be coming here thinking you can act like a loud frat boy! Â I would also describe Bouley's atmosphere as quite romantic and homey from its bookshelves decor around the restaurant. Â We dined in the downstairs area, which was more private. Â Every single dish was delicious to the last drop. Â Having eaten at Brushstroke also, Â I have my utmost confidence in dining again at a Bouley establishment. Â Bravo Chef! Highly recommended.",1
1047,490,5,2/6/2014,"this review is strictly brunch only. Â this place is on the money..and with 1 michelin star under their belt, it's not hard to understand why. once i stepped into the restaurant, i immediately fell in love. Â The wall was filled with Cortland apples... the scent of sweetness permeated the air...and then right there, i knew i was in for one special treat. we opted for the five course tasting menu.... amuse bouche - watermelon soup Big Eye Tuna - Green Apple, Bergamot, Osetra Caviar Porcini Flan - Alaska Live Dungeness Crab, Black Truffle Dashi Slow Braised Kobe Style Beef Cheeks - Blue Kale Gnocchi Caramelized Anjou Pear w/ Valrhona Chocolate, Biscuit Breton, Hot Toffee Sauce Lemon Verbena and Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream everything was delicious, beautifully presented and my favorite part??? Â The bread man. YES, the bread man. Â This guy had a cart filled with different kinds of bread... i couldn't decide, so i picked three different kinds. Â AND because it was my birthday, he wrapped up a whole loaf of bread for me, to go.",1
4366,490,5,1/28/2014,"Best lunch in NYC. Hard not to try Bouley when they offer an exquisite five course lunch for $55. Â  We were greeted with smiles and service throughout was impeccable. The restaurant looks the part, with its high ceilings and upscale elegant European feel. The cooking is classical French with a modern flair. The black cod was superb, the meats big on flavors and all accompanied by beautifully prepared vegetables, herbs and spices. The textures and flavors throughout were spot on and I simply adored the combination of oyster and kiwi that brought out the smells and flavors of the sea. We ended our amazing lunch with bread and cheese from the carts, followed by two desserts, including a moist and succulent chocolate soufflÃ©. A special mention for what may be the most delicate white chocolate mousse I've ever tasted. A square inch of this fluffy delight dissolves in the mouth leaving just a sprinkle of chocolate dust on the tongue. Overall excellent value for money and a great experience that one should not miss out on. American Chef David Bouley is no stranger to restaurant stardom, so no surprise that this Michelin restaurant sets such high standards. Note: obviously, early booking and jacket required here",1
4367,490,5,1/19/2014,"Fantastic! The outside was inconspicuous so we walked past by it a bit before we realized. The inside is very pretty and nicely decorated. The setting is sorta like a garden with vintage / classic furnitures. We both ordered the chefs tasting menu, which was a great lunch deal. Every course was delicious and very innovative. My favorite is the porcini flan and organic duck. The bread there is amazing as well. All in all, its one of the best restaurants I have been in terms of food and services and I will be coming back for sure!",1
4368,490,5,1/16/2014,"Not going to lie - this is pretty much as expensive as it gets BUT IT'S TOTALLY WORTH IT. Went with the prix fixe menu and every dish was ridiculously good. Â I kept thinking, ""this is amazing! this is amazing! this is amazing!"" Â (think aziz ansari) sea urchin, scallops and langoustine, porcini flan, farm egg with serrano ham - these were all so good, I could have eaten entire meals with just each of these dishes. Â  don't forget the bread car that roams around, but do remember that there are six courses - I got full pretty fast.",1
4369,490,5,1/16/2014,"You need to try this! I have been there two weeks ago and eversince, any food and drink I had, just doesn't excite me anymore. Fantastic place! If you want to kill your budget, try the 6 course diner. You will never forget this.",1
4370,490,1,1/14/2014,"Of all the restaurants I've been of this supposed caliber...this is by far the worst experience I've ever had. Â We were sat in the basement (a note to all who dare try it even after reading my review- request the main floor when you make your reservation...we felt like we were in a coffin in the basement, totally unappealing environment to dine in) - the food was just ok, several of the dishes had sauces that were distracting, we found a fly in my water glass- and then when my boyfriends wine came...there was a fly in his wine. Disgusting. Â The wait staff barely acknowledged it- never apologized and Â when we complained - the manager seemed apathetic...but promised to do 'something special for us' - which translated into an extra sorbet course...on a freezing January day...gee, thanks. Â I was so disgruntled after our experience I even wrote to the restaurant...I've never done this before, but I just felt compelled given what we payed for such a horrible experience....and unsurprising we have yet to hear back from anyone. Â Appalling.",1
4371,490,5,1/11/2014,"When I visited this amazing restaurant as a birthday present, I had no idea what I was in for. I'd never even heard of Bouley, but apparently there's a lot to research. There's Bouley Botanical, the urban farms performance kitchen. How about the Test Kitchen, where for $175 Â ""students will watch and ask questions as chefs from the Bouley kitchen craft fresh, seasonal ingredients into a beautifully presented tasting menu with ideal wine pairing."" And there's ""Brushstroke,"" taking unique seasonal ingredients and putting them to work in Asian cuisine with that perfect touch of sophistication. Yes, there's quite a bit to Mr. Bouley than the restaurant of his namesake. This review concerns the luncheon tasting menu, which was an eye-popping $35 before they hiked the price. The Black Cod Marinated with pistachio miso, heirloom tomatoes, elderflower, homemade raspberry vinegar, tonka bean and fresh verbena was breathtaking. I was a bit surprised at the use of heirlooms here, as I personally find them to be the Cousin Oliver of the tomato family. And elderflower teamed with verbena is a natural treatment for sinusitis, so their applications here are equally baffling. However, the chef is obviously a mage because it all came together flawlessly. The mushroom soup could very well be the most amazing soup I've ever had. It was masterfully prepared with the right thickness, not overly rich but very mushroomy in the best way. I don't see it on their online menu right now but if the Forager's Treasure of Wild Mushrooms with sweet garlic, special spices, grilled toro and black truffle dressing is anything near as good, I'd say it's worth trying. As a surprising kicker, our dessert seemed to take forever. Before we expressed any discomfort, Bouley came through with style, offering a large platter of various sugary treats that eclipsed our paltry little order tenfold. There was so much on deck we couldn't come anywhere near to finishing it all. And to top it off, they still brought out the original order of Hot Valrhona Chocolate Souffle with coffee ice cream and chocolate mousse. To say that it was impeccable is to quite simply sound repetitive here, as I'm singing their praises like I'm opening at Carnegie Hall. Short story, put this gold mine in your bookmarks because as great as the New York eating scene is, Bouley is as top shelf as it gets.",1
4372,490,2,1/11/2014,"Burning incense, tacky and intrusive music (e.g., Frank Sinatra), waiters with attitude, mediocre service, a decor like a stage set (fake books in the fake bookcase) including the silly apples on shelves in the reception area. I'd rather eat in Port Authority's main concourse than the ancillary rooms. There is one in the basement that is depressing and barren. Another room is too near the kitchen and feels like a storage room. Some of the food was good but some of it was gimmicky, some of it just odd and uninteresting. Why would anyone pay $200++ per person for this?",1
4373,490,2,1/9/2014,"When you come here, you can expect high quality French cuisine, but don't expect consistently excellent service. Service at the door was excellent because they had lent a jacket to a friend who forgot his at home. However, our server gave my fellow foodie a hard time when she tried to ask about specific ingredients and preparation methods in the food. Could it be that he was racist or sexist or just plainly in a bad mood? I could not tell, but his negative attitude was apparent and I had to request that the server excuse himself. After that, the food was served slowly, but very delicious. The gentleman who gave us bread was an all-star. His passion, dedication, and eagerness were apparent in the selection of his bread and his knowledge was impeccable. We ordered the $55 tasting menu for lunch. Food was 9/10, but service was 6/10, depending on who serves you. Hope you have a better experience!",1
4374,490,5,1/4/2014,"I came here to celebrate the completion of my Master's Degree as well as the first semester of a friend's law degree. After last night, Bouley has probably become my favorite restaurant in all of NYC. Incredibly intimate setting and unlike many of New York's other top notch restaurants, doesn't try to turnover tables as quickly as possible. Myself and my companion spent the better part of three hours sharing a table and never felt hurried. The entire staff is incredibly friendly, welcoming, and just generally enriches the entire dining experience. The Food: Ever been to a restaurant where there are so many excellent courses that you can't decide which to order? You will have that problem at Bouley - and a very good problem it is to have. The variety of great dishes almost guarantees a return visit. While there is a tasting menu, we decided to order a la carte (you can also order items on the tasting menu a la carte). We had the mushrooms and egg as appetizers which were both great. For entrees, we ordered the Colorado lamb and the pistachio and miso Cod. The lamb was incredibly tender and cooked to perfection and as much as I love lamb, I think the cod was the best dish of the night, which says a lot. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate soufflÃ© which was also delicious. It's worth noting that throughout the meal we were given Chef's tastings of numerous other dishes as well as quite a few goodies to take home with us. The bread is also amazing - especially the saffron variety. Overall, a fantastic dining experience and I look forward to returning!",1
4375,490,4,1/4/2014,"Bouley is a safe bet, but don't expect to be blown away. We had lunch there, and was welcomed by the smell of apples. The shelves in the _entre_ were filled with fresh apples -- a nice touch. The dining room was beautiful, comfortable and on par with elegant European restaurants. Service was attentive, professional. Didn't say too much about the food, which I tend to like. The sommelier was knowledgeable and made some interessting suggestion. I asked for the name of a couple of the wines, Â which he said he'd email me. Two weeks later, I'm still waiting for the mail. Food - competent, delicate and subtle. No bells and whistles. Crab and truffles was disappointing. Same with the lamb. But the prix fixe is very attractively priced at 55 dollars. The wine pairing was not value-for-money at 55. Overall: tasteful, comfortable, traditional and not very exciting. It's a safe bet, with no sharp edges. The dining room is beautiful. However, it's a crowded heat at this level. I did expect more and left slightly disappointed.",1
4376,490,5,12/31/2013,"One of the most memorable Birthday I ever spent in a restaurant. Â Once you walked in, I felt like its a whole new era. Their this shelf with real apples, colorful paintings on the wall...its beautiful. The Foie Gras was amazing. Â Porcini Flan with Alaska Live Dungeness Crab, Black Truffle Dashi, mushrooms, Whipped Fingerling Potatoes, Steak, Lobster...everything was so good! Â They had this Bread Trolley going around whole time. Â The Olive bread pistachio bread were very tasty. Â We had 2 complimentary appetizers and a dessert. The Dessert are to die for. Â They called it Strawberry Cloud. Â It was made with Strawberry Sorbet and Pineapple Cappacio and Oxygen with Milk and White Chocolate (it's one of them Molecular Gastronomy). Its like Heaven! Â Their services were excellent. And at last, we were given a small gift with Chef made Raisin Bread covered with sugar powder. Delicious! I am so happy my boyfriend took me there for my Big 30th Birthday :)",1

4378,490,4,12/30/2013,"My parents come to visit me and my spouse in NYC at least once a year, and mom has been saying she wanted to dine at Bouley for at least the past two. Last year, after she begrudingly agreed to go to Brushstroke and enjoyed the meal, her desire intensified. I felt so lucky to be able to get a reservation for a Friday night Â the week before Christmas at a prime time, especially after canceling on a spot that had just been ripped apart by Ryan Sutton for being a bad value. Bouley was the opposite--yes, the restaurant commands high prices, but this restaurant is one you get great value out of the food, service and wines. There was a young man who I made fast friends with...he controlled the bread trolley with a splendid array of house-made loaves, and yes I tried more than three. Our meal at Bouley capped off a week of dining out in New York, but this one was the richest. I would love to go back in another season to check out how the entryway may be different (on our visit, we entered to the smell and sight of rows of apples and tasteful Christmas touches by the plush waiting couches--my parents had a spot of trouble finding the restaurant's location). Members of my party were not at all put-out by the attire requirements, and in fact I'm of the mind that the men in jackets and ladies dressed up made the experience more special. I highly recommend this restaurant, it makes for a very fine evening, perfect for special occasion dining. I might try and book for my wedding anniversary this spring.",1
4379,490,3,12/28/2013,"Ok so this time I went for the best lunch deal in nyc. 5 courses, $55. The menu is quite similar to the dinner menu, it's just without one course. The big eye tuna was pretty fishy. The wild mushrooms were great. The beef was very gamey and not good. Because we didn't like it, we received an extra off the menu dessert. DO NOT ORDER THE PEAR DESSERT! It is very eggy. Even the waiter knew. Get the chocolate soufflÃ©. Since we didn't like the pear dessert, we received an amazing lemon dessert. I don't think I would come back again soon because the menu still hasn't changed even after 2 years.",1
4380,490,5,12/25/2013,"This is why Yelp invented 5 stars. Â Bouley earns all of them. Â The dining experience here is absolutely what you would expect from a world class 5 star restaurant. Â The apple scent upon entry is delicious. Â The restaurant is beautiful with nice domed / arched ceiling. Â Servers are well trained. Â The bread guy is outstanding - we all have seen cheese carts before, but a bread cart? Â It is for real. Â Food is outstanding of course, and the little in between courses they feed you are a delight. Â Special occasion? Â This is one of your best options.",1
1599,490,5,12/23/2013,"The moment you walk through the door, you embrace a feeling of warmth and the delicious scent of golden apples. The staff is top notch - professional and helpful and with a sense of humor! The setting is intimate. Bouley is dimly lit to create that romantic atmosphere. And I love how this restaurant has that nostalgic feeling to it. Imagine sitting in a red velvet chair next to your loved one in a room painted burgundy with gold tint in front of a fireplace and rustic bookshelf. Warm and cozy... Don't you get that tingly feeling? :) Whatever you decide for your courses, I can GUARANTEE that you'll fall in love with the food. I had ordered the mushrooms as my appetizer and the chicken as my main course. On top of that, the staff had given each table additional courses. So if you think you're going to leave hungry, think again! Fine dining at its best? Oh, yes! So what about the food?! - The blue cheese foam with a beet puree was sweet and savory and melted in my mouth like butter. - The flatbread tart with potato puree was so light and crisp that it literally fell apart in my mouth. I think it's the thinnest flatbread I have ever had in my life! - In my appetizer were slices of toro along with several types of mushrooms. I must say, it was exquisite and soooo delicious. - For my main course, they actually had first presented to us the pot they had used to cook the chicken. The pot was sealed with a piece of whole wheat bread that baked as the chicken was cooked. This locked in the moisture of the chicken and let me tell you, it's one of the most moist pieces of chicken I have ever had! It was just so juicy that I was still dreaming about it last night. The bread that sealed the pot did wonders! Amen. - Geing the dessert fiend that I am, I was extremely pleased that the chef gave us complimentary dessert dishes! My favorite was the frozen white chocolate foam topped with matcha powder. I felt like a kid again in a chemistry lab. That white chocolate foam literally melted in my mouth the moment it entered my mouth but it tasted so good like light foamy ice cream. Great date spot & great place to celebrate a fancy occassion. I will definitely be back at Bouley again!",1
4381,490,4,12/15/2013,"Went here with a few girlfriends for a night out and overall had a great night. Â 4.5 starts for its romantic country cottage like ambiance, including the delightful smell of fresh apples from the coat room when you walk in. We tried the tasting menu and while everything was good there were only one or two dishes that we thought were incredible. Several of the dishes had foam which was Ok at first but a bit over the top after a while. Â 5 stars for the service which was just delightful - very attentive and helpful. Â Overall great experience but was hoping for a little more with the food.",1
4382,490,3,12/10/2013,"This is a 3.5 star review. I went in late October and had a good time here. You first walk into the restaurant in a room filled with narrow little shelves with apples on them. Then you walk into the main dining room which is like your grandmother's auberge. It's quaint. I did the tasting menu and it was good. There were several dishes I liked such as the lamb medallions which was probably the best lamb I've ever had and the porcini crab dashi was very tasty. Some not so much like the port wine sauce that overpowered the filet, or the skate/langoustine dish that just tasted like pan-fried food. The wine was good, the sommelier was very friendly but I was disappointed that they weren't many robust wine options to be had or at least by the glass. I really liked the bread trolley which was dangerous. Could you imagine if your job was to push a cart full of about a dozen tasty breads? My favorite was the cranberry bread. There were also a few amuse bouches along the way. There were some dishes that were absolutely amazing and then there were some that were just eh. For $175 for the tasting I was hoping for a bit more, but I would be willing to come back. The lamb on it's own was enough of a selling point for me to just order off the regular menu. My service was good and everyone I interacted with there on the staff was very friendly. The bathrooms downstairs are interesting, or at least the ladies' room is it's kinda of a like a red victorian boudoir set up. The restaurant is really close to the train too.",1
4383,490,5,12/9/2013,"I've been meaning to write a second review for Bouley since they made my friend's birthday SO incredibly special and went above and beyond in every single way. The entire lunch was PACKED with surprises - after I simply asked them to just make it special by adding a candle in his dessert at the end of the meal. The service in Bouley is unbeatable. I am a foodie and ex-server/restaurant manager. Trust me, I know what is good service. BOULEY has the BEST service hands down from anywhere I've gone. They really go above and beyond to make your entire experience so memorable. They surprised us with so many little complimentary courses - I can't even begin to explain. All I can say is GO TO BOULEY! The $55 lunch special is the best deal you'll find for spectacular molecular gastronomy, and if you are eating dinner there, ask for their WHITE CHOCOLATE CLOUD :) I can't thank the team there enough for making my friend and all our experiences so special. I rave about this place more than any restaurant in NYC, and so do all my friends. P.S. This restaurant beat plenty of 3 michelin star restaurants I""ve dined at... so don't rely on those to determine which restaurants are ""best""",1
4384,490,5,12/9/2013,"One of most the memorable meals from the moment you walk in to the minute you leave. The decor made me feel like I was living in the 1920s.

I would come back just for the desserts!!",1

Â We didn't know it was a jacket required type of a place (even for lunch), but the host immediately offered my guy friend a dusty jacket to borrow. Â  We had the ""bargain"" tasting menu at $55 a head, and I would have to say the food was not that memorable for me to want to pay for it again. Â I do remember the desert being exceptional, but that was not enough to justify the price.

4385,490,5,11/28/2013,"Words can hardly describe the experience that we had at Bouley. No detail was too small for this Michelin caliber restaurant; the service and decor were all top notch, but it is the quality of the food that overshadows the rest. When here, we had ordered the tasting menu, and from that moment on, our taste buds were transformed. The dishes including exotic truffle, tender lobster, fresh salmon roe, and the most diversified selection of in house breads. Their flavors were so elegantly paired and the plates were so finely prepared that, in order to fully understand, you must experience it for yourself. The chef at Bouley masterfully crafted their menu, and you will not be disappointed.",1

4388,490,5,11/24/2013,"The best high end deal in town. $55 for their delectable tasting menu, with a side of attitude but a heaping of gorgeous decor. We arrived early and took a stroll outside, and a man came out saying ""Ladies, this way."" How magical! I knew our experience would be great already. The entry room is bursting in apple scents, and waiting room is as regal as a room in the White House. Your coat is checked and ladies room is through the dining room downstairs. We were seated immediately, in a cozy bench that looks out to the rest of the room. Beautiful, beautiful ambiance that is decked in winery paintings, roses, Picasso esque silverware and color. Every room has its own cozy and regal expression. We were given a free cold soup to begin, with a cracker and caviar amuse bouche: YUM. I ordered the tuna to start, which was absolutely delicious. I tried a friend's blinis, which was airy and appetizing. The duck was also beautifully done, with a simple and creamy side of potato puree. You get about 4 thumb slices, which doesnt seem like a lot but will be just enough for the progression of the meal. Then, came a strawberry white chocolate square as a palette cleanser, which reminded me a lot of Taiwanese milk ice. We were then provided their strawberries and amaretto plate--SO heavenly. I could have had a bucket of this. Â And to end, a pear dessert with two scoops of ice cream. With the receipt, a tray of mini macaroons and cookies, which you can bag if too full. With your return of jacket: a lemon cake as a gift, and it was quite sizeable. The non alcoholic blueberry drink was very pure, but was too tart to go with this meal. The bread tray did not come to our table. The combination and flow of all the food deemed this one of the most memorable meals of my life; every dish was equally amazing as its former and latter. One of the waitstaff had a bit of 'tude, which I found to be off putting. When he asked if one of us wanted to order a different starter since all of us ordered similar, I said sure, would he recommend one? Tuna. I said if thats his recommendation. Response: Puh! Â Do I? I myself dont eat tuna but i mean you all ordered the same so (babbles on rudely). A cultural quirk, but I would have appreciated a direct answer if he was going to make a suggestion in the first place. BUT, all were meticulous, well choreographed and fast. The world class food at a great price point forgives the raised pinkies.",1
4389,490,2,11/21/2013,"Over priced, under sized portions and over rated. Where should I begin...the foie gras and the scallops and shrimp appetizers were good. That said, the rest of the meal was below par. Ordered the lamb chops medium rare and one chop (of two) was over cooked and tough. Our waiter never came by to check on our dinner so I could not send it back until they came to remove our plates. They replaced the chop with another cooked to the correct temperature but still tough. The duck and the steak were ok but not memorable. None of the desserts were impressive though they did bring an extra to make up for the lamb chops. The service was not well orchestrated and our water glasses were rarely refilled. At over $150 per person all in I expected more. Go to Scalini Fideli instead.",1
4390,490,2,11/20/2013,"I came to Bouley for lunch and was thoroughly disappointed. Â Many courses felt heavy-handed with garnish and flourish but weren't tasty. Â Here's what I had: Oysters - these came with all the briney water poured out, with small slices of kiwi. Â Perhaps others like this flavor profile but I found it to be off-putting. Corn & lobster soup - this was quite tasty Salmon - overcooked to the point of it being dry. Â nearly inedible. Â the fingerling potato mash they served as a side was excellent though. Molten chocolate - I'm sure this wasn't their name for it. Â It had a burnt taste as if it has been in the oven a few mins too long. Something with strawberries - eh. The bread cart was very nice. One very customer service-y thing they do is give out small loafs when you leave - I really appreciated the gesture but my lemony loaf turned out to be extremely sticky sweet, I had one piece and threw it away. This meal was $300 (wine, prix fixe lunch, coffee) for 2 people and I was really disappointed.",1
4391,490,4,11/7/2013,"Well, can't fault the food. Delicious. Had an app of shrimp, scallop etc. entree Chatham Day Catch Lobster. Don't ask what they catch at night! Well, delish. But you know what the Bouley Diet is. Between the small portions and the prices both your body and wallet are going to be lighter! 4 stars because I'm still hungry'",1
4392,490,5,11/7/2013,"On par with Eleven Madison Park, Gramercy Tavern, and Jean Georges, Bouley was one of my favorite dining experiences in New York City. I came to Bouley on a Wednesday evening with a few colleagues and clients. As the one that made the reservation, I struggled to find seating for eight at a reasonable hour at other higher-end restaurants in New York. Getting a table at Bouley was easy, however, and the staff was accommodating Â in putting together two tables for us. The first room upon entering is a small alcove in which the wall is covered in apples.It smells absolutely amazing! The only other places I've seen this concept was in the restaurant Kai, in Mayfair, London. We ended up ordering the six-course tasting menu. I ate: - Cape Code Oysters: three small oysters combined with kiwis. Who would've thought that kiwis and oysters would go so well together?? - Porcini flan: probably would've gone with the wild salmon instead - Organic Connecticut Farm egg: Â would've preferred the lobster - Japanese kobe: everyone ordered this. It's only three tiny strips of meat, but based on my experience eating real Kobe beef in Japan, this is the real thing (most menu's stating ""kobe beef"" in the US is not the real thing) - biodynamic strawberries: amazing. Probably my favorite dish after the Kobe. I had to ask for seconds... - Chocolate souffle: I actually didn't order this but I think they mixed my order up - I'm not a big fan of chocolate so didn't finish it, but I think a chocolate lover would've liked the dish. Overall a great experience. We were seated in the lower floor so it was very quiet and the room wasn't filled at any point when we were there. We were definitely the largest party. Note that the courses are well-portioned, so you won't get too full early on in the meal. I did not leave stuffed like I did coming out of Eleven Mad. Overall, highly recommended!",1
1003,490,3,11/7/2013,"It's best for you to make reservations and confirm with them 2 days in advance prior to your dining date. I made a reservation for a weekday lunch at 11:30 AM when they open. We were one of the first ones there and the dining room slowing filled up during our meal. We were out at 2 PM. We had the lunch 5 course tasting menu for $55 and it took 2 hours and a half. The menu has a good amount of options and we each order something different to sample more of the menu. Some of the items we tried were: 1. Chilled cape cod wellfleet oysters - It was very light and refreshing especially with the kiwi slices on top of the oyster. 2. Blini of scottish smoked salmon - I like salmon and I like honey and this appetizer had both, so I definitely like this. 3. Black cod marinated with pistachio miso - The taste was very light and flavors could be stronger. 4. Porcini flan - I like the Dungeness crab in this, but not too sure about the rest. 5. Organic long island duck - I thought this was quite ordinary. 6. Slow braised kobe style beef cheeks - This had some gnocchi in the dish and the flavors were weak. 7. Chilled rhubarb soup - This is pretty refreshing. 8. kingston, ny white peach soup - Also, very refreshing. 9. Hot valrhona chocolate soufflÃ© - The cake was light with the right amount of sweetness. 10. Hot caramelized anjou pear- This was a very unique dessert. Aside from the tasting courses we also got to choose from a variety of bread, 2 amuse bouche which were ok, mash potato & fava bean sides that was good, and petit fours that had macarons, chocolates, & other goodies. Overall, I thought the food was just okay. The presentation was nice, the ingredients were top notch, and the service was efficient. Some dishes were unique and interesting. The taste was good but could be improve. I enjoyed the dining experience, but wished the food could've stand out more. The food didn't left an impression where I would want to come back. For the price it was worth it. I know for the dinner menu, which is very similar is triple the price. For me to give 4 stars to a restaurant I would want to come back, but since it didn't I can only give it 3 stars.",1
4393,490,4,11/3/2013,"Saturday lunch - tasting menu. Wouldnt recommend the kiwi oysters, wasnt sure why the kiwis were there. Great crab, duck and lamb. Both pear and chocolate suffle were great. Also when you tell them its your anniversary or a birthday they bring you a dessert with a candle on it. The fresh bread was delicious - pistachip hazelnut bread was divine though I bet all of those loafs were awesome. Service was great, obviously, but thats what you expect at a Michelin starred restaurants. I really enjoyed the 44yr old whiskey. I think they are good for what you pay, but I'll have to try the a la carte menu next time to really decide. For the price and reputation it was a good time. Plus I enjoyed that people were talking and laughing instead of a rigid environment where everyone whispers, like some other posh restaurants.",1
4394,490,5,11/1/2013,"Tantric sex. An 11-hour sleep. A four-handed massage. And even these metaphors can't do Bouley justice. One enters Bouley to tiny little shelves and shelves of apples, which are restocked daily. This must be what Willy Wonka had in mind with his wallpaper. The snozzberries taste like snozzberries. The dining room is deceptively cozy, deceptively because it leaves you totally unprepared for the fanciness of the food. Such is the state of fine dining, that one expects it to come along with good posture, elbows off the table, and a sense of not belonging. It's usually silly to talk about bread at a restaurant like this, but at Bouley, it's not silly at all. They have an in-house baker and bakery. You pick bread of the bread carte, which boasts over 40 kinds. This is borderline irresponsible, considering the rich meal you're about to eat, but it's impossible to resist. I picked a sourdough and walnut / apricot. I asked the baker how he stays fit, and he described running around the bakery all day, every day, like an olympian. He exuded fatigue and pride. These tastes. Comforting, like a sleeping bag. Food as cooked by the world's greatest grandmother. One imagines very long, very wise, very careful fingers. Simple, as if the restaurant were attached to some old, French farm. Abundant, like the farmer found a million dollars in the wall, and decided to invest it. Highlights: a whole foie gras, served minimally; grade five kobe beef, sliced thin and tasting like cotton candy; a chocolate soufflÃ© that would make Mr. Hershey blush. It's absurd that Bouley isn't mentioned in the same breath as Per Se or Eleven Madison. My meal was better here than at either of those two restaurants, and five times as comfortable. It is absolutely one of New York's best dining experiences.",1
4395,490,1,10/29/2013,This restaurant is paranoid about your reservation - especially if you made it thru Open Table- they called to confirm twice and then they called the hour before we came. That time I was in a meeting and not answering my phone and when I arrived at the restaurant they had cancelled the reservation!!!!! They made us wait for a table (which had our name on it till 30 minutes before) - No apology or anything - Food was uneven - lots of foam - (ugh) Too bad - NL,1
4396,490,5,10/28/2013,"Update - I have been here 5-6 times in the past few months. It has become my favorite fine dining option for all occassions, special and random. The food is unfailingly exceptional; the service always warm and welcoming. The porcini flan continues to be the best thing on the menu. The canape (?) that they serve as an amuse-bouche is not on the menu, and it is my favorite thing there. La Fleur is my favorite cocktail, and among the wines I prefer Sancerre. Not surprised at all that Bouley climbed the ranks in the Zagat ratings this year - reservations have to be made weeks in advance. Will go back. As usual.",1
4397,490,2,10/28/2013,"Entirely unimpressed, and even more disappointed it received two Michelin stars. Â I will not bother dissecting each course; suffice to say, the staff is pretentious and the cuisine does not live up to expectations. Â For instance, the chocolate souffle was more cake than anything, and everyone seemed quite proud of the bread cart (they should visit Robuchon - whose bread, cheese, and petit fours carts are noteworthy). Â In the interest of context, my guest and I ordered the Chef's Menu with Wine Pairings - about a $1,000 tab. Â In the last 9 months, I have accrued over 50 Michelin Stars (if you count repeat visits) by living in NYC and SF. Â I am no Anthony Bourdain, but I know a good, honest meal when I see one.",1
4398,490,3,10/26/2013,"Doesn't live up to the hype: 3 stars for the food. 4 stars for ambiance and service. We did the tasting menu. Everything was decently good but nothing was special or interesting. - Appetizers were nice, especially the wild mushrooms - although including a piece of tuna didn't make so much sense. We thought the porcini flan was a bit too sweet for our taste. Big eye tuna caviar with green apple sauce didn't come together so well. Blini of Scottish Smoked Salmon was delightful. My least favorite was the tomato coulis with cream and lobster Â - the tomato taste was overwhelming that you hardly taste the lobster but it could just be i'm not a tomato coulis fan. Plus that was a complimentary dish so I won't judge too much.. - The entrees (beef checks and duck) were rather ordinary and not much to talk about. You can easily find similar dishes in a decent $$ restaurant. - Desserts: we had all the desserts options: peach soup with grape ice cream, strawberry with amaretto ice cream, chocolate souffle, anjou pear. Nothing outstanding, rather too sweet and we couldn't even finish it. To end with a more positive note, they had a very good bread selection!",1
4399,490,4,10/25/2013,"4.5 stars! I booked dinner reservations about a month prior and had to call two days before the dinner to confirm it. Be prepared to enjoy a 3 hour dinner, folks! I was super excited to eat here, and I left as a happy and fat girl! The shelves of apples lining the entrance created a very warm and enticing ambiance, and the main dining area was very beautiful and opulent with blue velvet chairs and fancy ceiling beams. French dining in Dallas pales in comparison. Texas fancy is not the same as NYC fancy! The dinner tasting menu consists of about 6 plates for $175 or $280 with wine. My boyfriend and I decided the a la carte menu left us with more options. When I told the server I wasn't having wine as I don't drink alcohol, he seemed annoyed. At this price point, I expect profressionalism to be given to every paying customer even when we don't look as fancy as other patrons. Money is money, amirite?? Anyway, on to the food! Lamb chop and sirloin was cooked perfectly, but it wasn't anything special. Nothing innovative about grilled lamb here. Hoever, the fois gras salad and rabbit was the best salad I've ever had. I LOVE FOIE GRAS. I am a very unethical eater. I know animals die for my food. That's why I eat so much. Anyway, shavings of real truffle were scattered throughout. My only experiences with truffle were with synthetic oils, so now I know what the real thing tastes like, it'll be hard to go back to the fake stuff. Â The Chocolate soufflÃ© was kinda boring and traditional but still delicious. My favorite part of my $200 meal was the bread and butter and amuse bouche. Instead of having an ice cream truck with a scary man driving it around your neighborhood, Bouley has a very nice gentleman bring a cart full of delicious, fresh bread for you to sample. I was very ghetto and said I wanted to try all 15 or whatever varieties he had. When else will I be offered a cart full of delicious bread?? I am not shy about asking for my food. The amuse bouche were all very creative and left me wanting more. Bouley is a one Michelin star rated restaurant, which I think means it's worth going to if you're in NYC. I just felt that at this price point, my dinner was delicious but not innovative and rather boring.",1
4400,490,5,10/25/2013,"Celebrated our anniversary this afternoon here. The 5 course lunch option remains the best in the city given the food, service, and atmosphere. Â We should applaud restaurant owners who go the extra mile. Â David Bouley clearly is all about details. Â Newer restaurants have a lot to learn from an institution such as Bouley. Â How people rave about places like Torrisi where the setting is uncomfortable and the service lackluster i don't understand. Â Food wise it is not even a comparison. Â It you want a romantic setting this is a great option, especially downstairs. Â Is it opulent? Â Yes, but places like this are rare and it is fun to have this experience on occasion.",1
4401,490,5,10/20/2013,"On my daughter's 30th birthday, she chose Bouley as her birthday lunch place. Â Wowwww !! Â What a way to celebrate. Â First of all, upon entering, you are hit with the amazing aroma and fragrance of an apple-lined wall, row upon row of apples, hundreds of them. Â I couldn't get over how delightful a fragrance we experienced. Â Then you enter a lovely lounge area that my words would not aptly describe, except for me to say that is was beautiful. Â Elegant and beautiful. Â I so wanted to snap up a photo of every nook and cranny but ended up taking none. Â I just wasn't sure of the temperament of me walking into this elegance and being a camera nut.....just didn't feel right. Â Yet, upon leaving, there were a lot of people sitting there, and it didn't feel right either, and thus, you'll just have to go there yourself to see how exquisite this place really is. Â The main dining room is sumptuous. Â You feel like you've been invited to dine at somebody's mansion. Â At least I felt that way. Â Even the bathrooms, located down the stairs, were elegant and beautifully appointed. Â There is a private dining salon downstairs, as well, that was just knock-your-socks-off GORGEOUS. Â My jaw dropped in every room I entered, I kid you not. As for the food, one of the reasons we chose lunch over dinner is because the menu was quite similar for both meals, yet the prices were decidedly cheaper, so I figured why not save a little here and there when possible. Â We went for the tasting menu, in which we all could choose from a lovely sampling of dishes.....from appetizers to entrees to the desserts. Â Needless to say, all food was excellent, with beautiful, if not dramatic presentation (similar to Le Bernardin), and the flavors and combinations of ingredients were quite interesting. Â Ironically, the one dish I actually didn't like (personal preference, that's all) is the one I thought I'd like the most. Â It was the porcini flan. Â There was some strong flavor in there that permeated the crabmeat that I normally love, probably the dashi, and I couldn't finish it. Â Otherwise, everything was absolutely delicious. Â Between my husband, 2 daughters and myself, we dined on....... APPETIZERS 1. Â Dairy-free Asparagus Soup 2. Â Blini of Scottish Smoked Salmon w/ Salmon Trout Roe, White Truffle Honey 3. Â Black Cod Marinated with Pistachio Miso w/ Heirloom Tomatoes, Elderflower, Homemade Raspberry Vinegar, Tonka Bean, Fresh Verbena 4. Â Forager's Treasure of Wild Mushrooms w/ Sweet Garlic, Special Spices, Grilled Toro, Black Truffle Dressing ENTREES 5. Â Indian Reservation Sourced Copper River Salmon w/ Mint Pesto Crust, Organic Fresh Peach Roasted with Cuban Sage, Parsley Root 6. Â Organic Long Island Duck w/ Organic Golden Nevada Dates, Hudson Valley Organic Hand Milled Polenta, Confit of Young Organic Clementines 7.

Hot Caramelized Anjou Pear w/ Â Valrhona Chocolate, Biscuit Breton, Hot Toffee Sauce Lemon Verbena and Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream 11. Â Strawberries w/ Amaretto Ice Cream In addition to all this food (luckily served in small portions), we also were given ample choices of bread, an amuse bouche of tomato coulis with cream and lobster (delicious), as well as a very interesting palate cleanser (mid-way through the meal) Â of ""snow,"" which was this amazing snow-like concoction that immediately dissolved upon hitting one's tongue, and you are only left with the essence of the fine dusting of sweetened green tea powder...very interesting and lots of fun trying to figure out what it was... still don't know. Â They also brought my daughter another dessert with a candle in it just for her birthday, and if that wasn't enough, a plate of miniature cookies and chocolates, one of which was a macaron. Â I couldn't make it that far. Â I was done with the chocolate soufffle. A sumptuous meal fit for royalty, and that we were, even if but for a moment in our lives. Â I loved Bouley, and I'm so glad they made my daughter's 30th birthday even more special.",1
4402,490,5,10/20/2013,"After calling twice during the week and being told there was no availability, a reservation opened up on open table last minute. Â Off we went to enjoy the famous Bouley lunch extravaganza. We were not disappointed. I started with the salmon, followed by the farm egg, leading into the chicken (the beef was sadly sold out), peach soup with last option being the pear tart. My date's different selections Â included the porcini flan, the duck and the wild raspberries. We enjoyed a reasonably priced bottle of wine and overindulged on the epic bread selection throughout. From first greeting to good bye the effort of the staff was apparent in delivering an impeccable experience to us and we were delighted to take part. For two and a half hours we weren't in manhattan but in quite another, charming little place. Â Our stomachs certainly approved. I did debate between giving four vs five stars for one reason: my entree was merely ok. Â In the absence of the beef I probably made a poor selection in ordering chicken but feel that it was simply nothing out of the ordinary. On the other hand I didn't pay for a specific meal I ordered a tasting menu, and as such I do suppose less weight be given to any one course, and more emphasis placed on the overall experience. It was a great journey from first nibble of bread to last bite of chocolate and I look forward to taking it again soon despite my waistline's objection to the contrary.",1
4403,490,5,10/15/2013,I thought it was a pretty special place. Â Probably the best option downtown in the Tribeca area and even worth the trek from uptown. Â The bread basket options were phenomenal and probably among the best I have ever seen.,1
4404,490,4,10/14/2013,"KenScale: 8.5/10 Bouley is one of the long-standing New York dining institutions from acclaimed chef David Bouley, offering French cuisine with Asian influences. I finally made a trip that was long overdue for lunch (which features a relative bargain of $55 per person for five-course tasting menu), and wasn't disappointed. Bouley's food is everything you could ask for in French opulence. I did like all of the dishes, but can now understand how Bouley can be a polarizing place at times, with some people thinking of it as too stuffy. Blini of Scottish smoked salmon (with salmon trout roe, white truffle honey) was a light and playful start to the meal. In black code marinated with pistachio, I could definitely sense a touch of Asian flavor and technique. My main meal, all-natural Pennsylvania chicken (with blue kale, roasted garlic) was a flavorful dish. At the end, though, I enjoyed the desserts a little more than the preceding dishes. Kingston, NY White peach soup was very refreshing without being overly sweet, while hot caramelized anjoy pear was so decadent that I couldn't stop eating even while feeling guilty. I absolutely love the decor of the restaurant, which makes you think you're literally at a palace or a mansion in France. I couldn't stop marveling at the delicate touch that has been put to the venue, highlighted by large oil paintings on the marble wall. The service was very attentive and professional as well. It's definitely not easy to snag a reservation here (though probably not as hard as other top-flight restaurants in New York City such as EMP or Le Bernardin), so the best bet is to go for lunch for the five-course tasting menu. For gentlemen, jacket is required to dine at the restaurant.",1
4405,490,5,10/13/2013,"Great atmosphere, excellent food, and wonderful service. Been for lunch and dinner and experience was similar for both (which was great), so either is a great option. Â Tasting menu is excellent, had some truly creative and unique dishes that had incredible, complex flavors. Â Service was incredibly attentive and friendly. Â Didn't make you feel uncomfortable or overly formal. Â The room is beautiful and very cozy. Â Overall great experience and one of my favorites. Â It has one Michelin star, which really surprises me, I think it is on par with the three star restaurants I have been to (Daniel, Jean George, ...)",1
4406,490,5,10/12/2013,"I dined here for lunch after having Per Se the night before. I gotta say, I was more impressed with Bouley than Per Se. The ambiance and food really impressed me. It felt like dining in Napa Valley in the middle of Manhattan. The five course tasting menu for lunch was my favorite meal during my trip. GET THE PORCINI FLAN (don't judge a book by its covers). I was very hesitant to get it so I made the hubby get it. I fell in love with the dish, I wanted to order another one a la carte for $22. I opted for the miso cod, which was nothing special. Thank you Bouley for the ""Happy Anniversary"" flan cake, it was delicious. Bouley is a must when you're in NY!",1
4407,490,5,10/10/2013,"I would list it in my Top five meals ever. Â  Â Was it a little pretentious? Â YES, and it added to the meal.

Loved every part of our dining experience.",1
4408,490,1,10/8/2013,"I can't understand what all the fuss is about. I've been to France, and I have eaten better for a lot less money. The only reason I'm giving this place a 1 star rating is because of its lovely interior. Now, where do I start? First of all, the portions are way too small for the prices they charge. Nothing really stood out in flavor and the floor manager was an arrogant bastard. We had a party of 7, the largest in the room, and we got attitude when we were trying to decide on some wine for he table. We apparently weren't deciding fast enough for their liking. The real downside was, they have a bread cart with some really good bread choices, and they got snooty with us when we asked for more bread while we were waiting for our first course to come out. It was bad enough that appetizers were measly little bits of nothing, but one of us was starving, and got attitude from the manager when he asked for the bread cart to come around. Not one table had the bread cart by their side when we asked for bread. When they finally brought the cart back, the bread guy got snooty with us. He sliced the bread so thin, you would think he was trying to ration it for the next day. Finally, after everyone finished their meal, they quickly handed us our check. Not once during our meal were we asked if we were enjoying the food. Very strange considering there was about four waiters tending to us. I guess if your reading this, you might think I'm some bum from NJ who doesn't know fine dining because I'm not mentioning the dishes, but you would be mistaken. Our party practically ordered everything that people rave about at this establishment, so I didn't want to go down the list, making for a lengthy review. I've worked as a chef in a French restaurant and I really love to cook. My travels have taken me around the world and I have dined at the best places you could think of. I can be sophisticated and I can be laid back. When I dine at a fine establishment, I'm very classy, charming, courteous and knowledgable of the cuisine. My friends who dined with me were all professionals and we were by far the best dressed group in the restaurant and we treated the staff with the outmost respect. Our bill was over $1000, and we left a $200 tip. With that said, it wasn't worth the money at all. Â My suggestion would be to head over to AmÃ©lie on west 8th street if you want good French food.",1
4409,490,3,9/29/2013,"It is so disappointing to see that Bouley has slipped...We've been to Per Se, Le Bernardin and counted Bouley as our #1, but last night our tasting menu, although still delicious, was not perfect; and it is perfection that we come here seeking. The mushroom starter was at room temperature and seemed to be lacking seasoning and the black truffle. The flan came lukewarm first; they brought us a second round of warm ones luckily. The cod was ok (the farm egg was sublime as usual), lamb was amazing, the soufle was mixed. My soufle was more like a knock-off lava cake; none of the lightness one would expect. The music was a weird mix of techno and some other stuff with varying volumes throughout the night as well. We expressed our perspective and our servers were nice enough to comp us a couple glasses of wine but I would expect the maitre d' to at least check in (which he used to before) but not this time. I am guessing focus has shifted away from the flagship and it shows.",1
2745,490,3,9/24/2013,"Its fancy, classy, Â upscale and dressy Â to impress your in laws. But the food was ok at best, somewhat overpriced. Service was decent, but the place was too stuffy and french for my liking. Most importantly did not care for the food and its overpriced. Not going back here again.",1
4410,490,5,9/24/2013,Just the best experience I've ever had. The waiters care about you in any way and make all their possible to please you. They help you chose the wine according your taste. Food and atmosphere are amazing. Unique experience. You can go there eyes closed.,1
4411,490,2,9/11/2013,"I went to Bouley as part of a large family birthday party. My partner and I were unimpressed generally. The descriptions of the food on the menu didn't reflect reality (the menu said chilled rhubarb soup, what came was sorbet) and the food itself was uninspired and underseasoned. Worst of all was the wait time: it took at least half an hour between each course, leaving us hungry and antsy. The waitstaff was very professional, even with mid-meal substitutions and changes, so I get the feeling it was a problem with the kitchen handling such a large party. I hope the restaurant was having an off-night - perhaps Bouley is better at intimate dinners than family parties?",1
4412,490,5,9/7/2013,"I've always had a theory that you can predict the quality of a meal to come by the free bread they serve beforehand. I've never been wrong, and Bouley just makes my case stronger. The selection of breads and butters presented before and throughout the meal are so good I could have left satisfied even if I hadn't tasted the actual courses. But I'm glad I did. The flavor of each course is an exquisite journey into a new land unlike any I'd ever visited. And just as I started to come down from the high and settle into a sense of normalcy, the course would be finished and they'd be topping up my wine and preparing me for the next. Special attention seems to have been paid to the texture, density and crispiness of every ingredient. I'm still not sure exactly what the amuse-bouche was, but I will never forget the implosion of airy buttery awesomeness that came from that single bite. Service did not disappoint either. I live in a 1-bedroom Brooklyn apartment, but during this meal I was treated like the king of a relatively large country. Overall, one of the best dining experiences of my life. And did I mention I went there for the lunch? Possibly the best value for money fine dining in the city.",1
4413,490,4,9/3/2013,"Four of us came here for dinner on a Saturday night. We all got the tasting menu with wine pairings. The price of this dinner is ridiculous but luckily for me it was a gift and I didn't have to pay. This was by far the fanciest dinner I've ever had. It consisted of 6 courses with 6 different wines. Some of the more memorable dishes were the Sea Urchin, the Boat Lobster, the Rack of Lamb, and the Melon Soup. I'm not a big fan any foams in my food, but the Sea Urchin was great. It had both black and red caviar and was delicious. The Boat Lobster and the Rack of Lamb both were cooked perfected and looked great on the plate. The Melon Soup was a little disappointing. It seemed to me like pieces of melon mixed in with half-frozen melon juice. Before every course, one of the servers, (I think he has a special title,) came to introduce the wine and pour a little less than the full glass. I'm really not a wine connoisseur, but I enjoyed all of the wines and especially the German desert wines at the end of the meal. In the middle of the meal one of the servers came to us and offered to try one of their 11 kinds of breads. After listing the first half dozen, we stopped him. They all sounded interesting to us. So, we asked him to bring us all 11 to try, and he did! I left fairly tipsy but still a little bit hungry. Â Luckily, we got some lemon corn bread to go which was a nice surprise. As an added bonus, when we were leaving we peeked into the kitchen from the outside and all of sudden David Bouley jumped out to run to his other restaurant across the street to get some more fish. He exclaimed, ""They just keep ordering the fish!"" He told us that it was their second night using the remodeled kitchen. You can now come and watch them work from the outside. Free cooking show! I think of food in this restaurant as art. You are here to experience sublime culinary creations and expand your palette. You will also be treated like royalty. So, if this an experience you're looking for, this restaurant is perfect.",1
4414,490,5,8/14/2013,"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and I must say I was blown away. The food was impeccable and the service was top notched. We were quickly seated at the dining room downstairs. The atmosphere was quite romantic and intimate. We both ordered the 6 course tasting menu and a bottle of red wine. The waiter was very knowledgeable about the restaurant and the menu. He was very sweet, entertaining and pleasing to look at (shhhhhhhh). For the first course, I ordered Fresh Malibu Sea Urchin Terrine. In terms of presentation, it was unique and taste wise was delicious. The sea urchin was placed in a cube like shape gelatin , with the imitation of the sea urchin sitting in an ice cube. The second course, I ordered Spanish Sea Cucumber & Live Scottish Langoustine. It was prepared in such a way I've never seen before. It was mouthwatering. The third course, I ordered Chatham Day Boat Lobster. I was so pleased with the sauce, I almost scooped up every drop of the soup on the bowl. Next, I got the prawn. The sauce was amazing but I also discovered right then and there I was allergic to prawn. My throat started itching but after drinking a couple glasses of lemon water and wine, the symptoms subsided. Thank god! Of course I ordered Organic Long Island Duck. The duck melted in my mouth. My mouth was in heaven and I was definitely in heaven. For dessert, I got the Pineapple SoufflÃ©. It was the perfect dessert to end the meal. This whole dining experience was filled with pleasant surprises. We were constantly surprised with their complimentary dishes. They offered a complimentary soup and cracker with caviar before the meal and surprised us with ice cream and macaroons/ cookies to complete this whole dining experience. Good food is not good unless it is in accordance with the service. It was an expensive dinner, but I left as a happy customer and completely satisfied.",1
4415,490,5,8/9/2013,"I went here a few years back and only remember one thing- but boy was it good! I think about it all the time. After a super delicious meal, they gave us this loaf of lemon pound cake to go. I have never tasted such a strong, pleasant, flavorful and juicy piece of cake! It is like somehow, the juice of 100 lemons was squeezed into one cake. And it was perfect. For the last few years, I have purchased a piece of lemon pound cake at every french bakery that I visit (even in Paris), and never has Bouley found competition.",1
4416,490,5,8/4/2013,"Went here for the prie fixe 5-course lunch. Such a great deal for $55! Each course was fantastic, and there were 2 complementary pre-appetizers, 2 bread rolls, the BREAD CART with an amazing selection of 10 loaves baked in-house (it came around twice for us!), and a complementary post-dessert with mini-macarons, chocolates, and more. The wine was great, and the service was EXCELLENT. I was afraid we wouldn't get as good service as others raved due to our age, but it was even better than I expected.",1
1708,490,5,8/4/2013,"This restaurant is insane. Everything about my experience there was beyond any expectation I could have. We had an 8-course meal and every dish was a unique flavor experience. We had 4 bottles of wine and they were all exceptional. The service and staff were perfection. The decor makes you feel like you are in a castle in the south of France, mostly because all the materials are all salvaged antiques from Europe. It is a truly magical restaurant.",1
3518,490,5,8/3/2013,"Booo-lay! Â The Missus and I finally got here and kids, it doesn't disappoint. Beautiful ambiance, especially downstairs in the quieter more intimate Red Room. The way to play it is come for lunch: almost the same menu as dinner. Â The five course tasting menu is superb. Â Innovative, yet with a big nod to classic French and American cooking. With two complementary courses thrown in and a few amuse bouche, we're talking a memorable eight course lunch, for $55. Such a deal! And you won't need dinner later on. The lunch is spread out over at least three hours, as it should be. The much touted Porcini Flan alone is with the price of admission. Incredibly delicious. The salmon blinis are served on little air light ""buns"" of meringue and blew my mind. Accompanied with a thin crisp topped with a ricotta/fingerling potato cream and black truffles just for added decadence--Wow. Duck medallions with cherries was the most flavorful and well prepared I've ever tasted. Â Best creamed potatoes of my time on Earth (so far). I could fill the screen with a blow by blow, but special mention must go to dessert, which was a fabulous chocolate soufflÃ©. Service is friendly, professional, and solicitous. Bathrooms you'll want to move into. And the bread service--holy frijoles! Â Over ten types of house baked breads. Â So flavorful and moist. Â Come hungry so you can try at least half the bread selection. No hype here, Bouley delivers and then some. The Red Room would also be a choice location for a business lunch, if you need a relatively quiet place to wine, fine dine, and impress with your good taste.",1
4417,490,1,8/1/2013,"Called me on a Saturday morning to confirm a reservation for late next week. They took great care to remind me that men have to wear a jacket (there are no men in our party, and this is the third time they've called to remind me). Then they cancelled the next week, because they just realized they're closed for renovations. What!?",1
4418,490,5,8/1/2013,"Despite their stuffy atmosphere and the fact that men have to wear their jackets throughout the entire meal, Bouley was amazing. We went for the 5 course lunch tasting menu for $55, and it was a great deal. We made an early reservation at 11:45 am, since we had a flight to catch afterwards. When we arrived, there was only one other party there, but when we left, almost the entire restaurant was full. On a Wednesday! We were given 2 delicious amuse bouches and 2 pieces of bread, and then they wheeled over an entire bread CART with loaves for me to pick from. A freaking cart of bread! If I had thought this through properly, I would've asked for a slice of every type (there were ~8 loaves) and asked the leftovers to be packed to go. I only tried a few since I was afraid I wouldn't be able to eat the remainder of my meal. They also gave us a special type of butter than was imported from France. I don't remember much about it other than it was delicious and I wish I could have taken it with me. My favorite dish was the porcini flan with dungness crab. I could have eaten an entire meal of the flan and been content. The other courses were delicious as well, and I loved how they brought us an extra dessert, along with extra scoops of gelato. 3 desserts and 6 scoops of gelato? Yes please! We also got a plate of petit fours, and I gobbled down the mini macarons before asking for the rest of it to be packed. They were still delicious when I had them 3 days later. The logistics of their service astounds me. We were served by at least 10 people, and it ran like a well oiled machine. As soon as we finished one dish, one waiter would swoop in and clear the table, and another waiter would swoop in with a new set. Then someone else would set down our next course, and another person would come over and explain what we were having. The only minus point is that their wine by the glass and half bottle selection is quite limited. Amazing experience! If I ever find myself in NYC again, I am definitely coming back.",1
4419,490,5,7/29/2013,I ate here with clients a few months back. Chef Bouley was in residence and crafted our meal personally since a member of our party frequents this restaurant. Â Words can not describe the expereince. Pricey but worth every penny and would have paid more for the experience. Amazing!,1
4420,490,5,7/26/2013,"The interior of Bouley was beautiful and exquisite. Right after entering the restaurant I felt as if I have been invited to an French country house dinner. The server was extremely delightful and professional. The following lists what we had with our 5-course tasting menu: *We started off with warm bread and butter and then an amuse-bouche of a pumpkin puree soup topped with pine nuts and drizzled with truffle oil. *Porcini flan with dungeness crab - Â This is supposedly one of the signature dish of Bouley and it does not disappoint! It was so flavorful and delicious that I wish I had more of it. I dreamed about this soup - It was that memorable! *Roasted Chatham skate with scallop ravioli Â - I had wanted to try skate in NY as they are rare in California. The skate was moist and tender. The scallop ravioli and sauce paired well with the skate. *Scottish salmon with spinach and ginger crust - Â The salmon was okay. *Long Island Duckling with snow peas, turnips, kohlrabi puree - This dish has interesting textures and great flavor profile. Everything came together nicely. *White Fallow Venison with black truffle gnocchi - The venison was cooked just perfect. *Coconut yogurt sorbet and pineapple - Okay. *Mango and passion fruit dome with rosemary and white coffee ice cream Â - It's amazing how much wonderful flavors can be incorporated into a dessert, yet have them taste so good together. *Chocolate souffle with maple vanilla ice cream and chocolate sorbet - Simply decadent! It's one of the more refined dining experience I have had without needing to spend a fortune. I would return to Bouley in a heartbeat. It was a symphony for the taste buds!",1
4421,490,4,7/26/2013,"came here on our girls date out, we had wonderful time because food was delicious, except from time to time, we all get too carried away, laughed a bit too loud, and everyone turned and looked at us=p i know we should be more lady like, but it is hard when we get together. anywayz...back to reviewing this restaurant, this place has wonderful service. the first time we went, chef gave us a few more surprised dishes than what on the menu. we ended up spending more than 3 hrs in the restaurant for the $55/5 course meal. totally enjoyed our time there. will definitely go back again!!!",1
4422,490,5,7/24/2013,"I liked the ambience, their service was excellent. They're very nice & friendly. I had the lunch course & I loved it (Porcini Flan is my favorite) definitely going back again!",1
4423,490,3,7/24/2013,"The ambiance and food were amazing. The dining experience was compromised by a rude arrogant waiter. When asked if the sardines were fresh , the waiter did not reply and glared angrily. Simply rude, inappropriate, and angry. My bill for 4 people was $1300. Â At that price do not ruin my experience with an angry waiter. My guest was simply probing for more information about the sardine dish. Will not be back.",1
4424,490,5,7/23/2013,I went last week and I am returning on Monday. This place is excellent. Full stop.,1
4425,490,4,7/21/2013,Husband and I went here for the $55 course lunch and it was completely worth it. Â I'd come again just to experience the different breads they offer you. Â It's a great deal as you get amuse bouches as well and they gave us a lemon tea loaf to take home. Â I loved each of the courses but the porcini flan was the best!,1
4426,490,5,7/21/2013,"Came for the unbeatable $55 5-course lunch deal in December 2011. One of the most memorable dining experiences of my life! We started off with an amuse bouche of pumpkin soup. Spiced and warming, with toasted pine nuts encased in a crunch sugar envelope to complement. Then the bread. They wheel around a bread cart stuffed with fresh loaves and you can have as much as you want. I was a big fan of the cranberry walnut! I had asparagus with basil dressing in a comtÃ© cloud; black cod marinated with pistachio miso (AMAZING. Perfectly cooked and flaky, the cod was the highlight of the meal.), organic buckwheat, & ginger sauce; slow braised Kobe beef cheeks w/ ricotta gnocchi and blue kale (my 2nd favorite of the day). The main course was accompanied by buttery mashed potatoes, pureed extremely smooth and topped with chives. Loved them! (Although I'd rather not think how much butter was in them). There was some sort of sorbet as a palate cleanser (forgettable). For dessert, I had caramelized anjou pear, valrhona chocolate, biscuit breton, hot toffee sauce, lemon verbena & tahitan vanilla ice creams. Since I'd mentioned that we were celebrating my sister's birthday, we were given a deliciously creamy creme brulee as well. To add to the indulgence were the mignardises. Service was friendly and relaxed, although they brought our desserts when half the table was in the bathroom so the ice creams were melting when we got back. The atmosphere was intimate, and I loved the smell of apples that greets you as you enter. I'd love to go back someday!",1
4427,490,5,7/19/2013,"An exceptional dining experience in a fabulous setting. Rooms filled with books, flowers, and art provide the perfect ambiance. The service is exceptional, and the food, whether you order the tasting menu or a la carte, is fabulous. The bread is made on-site, and spectacular. A much easier reservation than some of the other big names in NYC.",1
4428,490,5,7/17/2013,"Food: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Cleanliness: 5/5 Decor & Style: 4/5 Only a 1 star Michelin restaurant (should be a 3 star!)? Well, i'll admit, i'm no connoisseur, so I was easily impressed by this place. First, lets describe the service. It was about a 7-9 course dinner meal (lost count). EVERYTIME we changes plates, the staff/servers replaced the silverware, all 8 utensils. Once again, i'm no expert or connoisseur so I cannot tell you what the silverware was (I only know fork and spoon, and that thing called, umm... a knife?, and then 6 more...). So thats 7-9 silverware changes at dinner itself. The staff was extremely attentive, too attentive, that it made me a little nervous. Even when I went to the restroom, I felt like they watched my every move (eeek!). Basically, 5/5 for service, I doubt it can get better. I may also add, they let you pace yourselves the entire time. No rush, take as much time as you need. We stayed there for 4 hours! They told us to take our time, and no rush to leave as they pre-set dining hours so there was no one else after us (good assurance). It was an enjoyable experience and very relaxing. Almost like a vacation resort of dining. Food. Umm... 7-9 course dinner at Bouley, at a $$$$ price menu (can't get in without a sports jacket). 5/5 for me, nuff said... Cleanliness: Very nice. btw you have to go through a small like dungeon to get to the restroom. Pretty cool. As clean as you can get. 5/5, not much to say here. Decor: Alright as you can see, I gave it a 4/5. It was very nice looking, eloquent, and luxurious. But, no 5/5 for me because it didn't stand out. I only give 5/5 when i eat at a place that tells me ""wow"". Still, 4/5 is very nice, just no ""wow"" factor. Okay, there you have it, try it out, even if it's once in your life.",1
4429,490,4,7/10/2013,"I could rave about this place all day long. The food was excellent, the ambiance enjoyable and the service fantastic. I have several food allergies and the staff didn't bat an eyelid when I rattled off the list of things I'm intolerant to, instead they directed me to the items that could be modified. In the end, the kitchen did not disappoint as I momentarily lost my mind over the Intolerant-friendly version of the North Carolina shrimp and sea scallop appetizer, I went mad for the New England sea bass and I, quite literally, went all 'World War Z' over the bread cart. My word, that bread was fantastic. It was an evening well spent and the meal/service worth every cent. If the dinner prices are too hair-raising it seems Bouley offers a $55 five course tasting menu for lunch, which I imagine is as good as what's on offer for dinner. Two words: just go. Dining at Bouley: fortheintolerants.com/?pâ€¦",1
4430,490,5,7/4/2013,"Bouley never disappoints ! Â I love how the place felt, warm, inviting. I had the tasting menu and it was just superb. My favorite was the porcini flan. It was decadent!!!! My Long Island Duck was perfect! The service was impeccable as well. I would recommend everyone try this place once ! But it is an older crowd so be prepared",1
4431,490,5,7/3/2013,"Although the food is pricey, you are definitely paying for a fantastic meal and amazing service. Everyone gets the prix fixe but there are more than enough selections and you will leave full and satisfied. In addition to the meal (for lunch at least), they also bring you artisan bread and a surprise palate cleanser between courses. The service is also great.",1
4432,490,5,7/2/2013,"I came here for date night, and I loved every minute of it! Our server was wonderful and attentive, without being a nuisance. I had the chicken entree, and it was the best I'd had all year. I've bought their roast chickens at their bakery (before it closed) on many occasions, but this dish was on another level. Our meal came to approx. $300, incl wine, tax & tip. Worth every penny!",1
2165,490,5,6/30/2013,"We had the lunch tasting menu. Everything was tasty, although some things worked better than others. The entrees weren't quite as strong as the appetizers. My duck was perhaps a little too chewy, and the beef was lacked flavor. Desserts were excellent.",1
4433,490,5,6/28/2013,"Don't go here, especially not for their Saturday prix fixe lunch. Â It's tough enough to get reservations as it is, without you blocking out another table. We have seldom had a better meal in a restaurant.",1
4434,490,4,6/27/2013,"Whether your dining here for a luncheon with your girlfriends or out for a romantic evening, this French elegance encompasses everything upscale and luxurious. The cuisine is simply outstanding and well-worth the price. A wide drink selection is offered, the ambiance is stellar, and the staff is impeccable. I have been here a number of times and like to show it off to newcomers. Sitting in this French country-side feeling venue makes you feel as though you have escaped the states and are in the real place.",1
4435,490,5,6/26/2013,"Yum, yum yum, because i tried Brushstroke(another bouley's restaurant), Â their food wasn't that impress me. But this time the luncheon tasting menu surprise me, $55 you got 5 courses, if you including petite four and welcome dish its total of 8 course. We had order non-alcoholic drink to start, La Myrtille (Blueberry puree with iced tea - not sweet), Virgin Danube (Elderflower Gelee, Elderflower lemonade - sweet). From the drink to breads to meals everything are awesome. HIghly recommended for any special occasion. the oyster is ok, a bit salty ( i have better raw oyster from Lobster Palace or gramercy tavern) Porcini Flan is a must dish.",1
4436,490,5,6/24/2013,"Everything was perfect. Â Imaginative, wonderful food. Â Impeccable service. Â Lots of unexpected surprises from the chef. Â Could not have been a better experience, and our standards are quite high.",1
4437,490,4,6/24/2013,"Having secured a reservation a few months in advance, my SO and I visited on Saturday for lunch. The prix fixe deal is incredible. Between the both of us, we got to try ten different dishes (plus two amuse-bouches) and so much fresh bread. Outstanding were the Smoked Salmon Blini, Porcini Flan, LI Duck, Kobe Style Beef Cheeks. We were sufficiently stuffed by the end of the meal. Service was excellent and the food was wonderful. As expected. It was marvelous. You have to eat here. One thing we noticed, however, was that we were seated in the basement. And while it was nice and quiet, it was for all purposes, the ""asian"" room. In all, there were 5 parties downstairs, all Asian. When we finished with our meal and ascended to the ground floor, the contrast in diversity was even more stark. Not a big deal to me, and we might have been able to ask for a table on the main floor, but come on. Can we be a bit more conscientious of seating practices before people start feeling like they're being ostracized for, perhaps, their race? I'm glad that we were able experience Bouley regardless of this.",1
4438,490,4,6/21/2013,"It's good, it's better than good. The reason it's not 5 stars is because it's not consistant. I've dined here about 2-3 times a year over the past 3 years and the hit/miss ratio is about 2/1. Food itself is consistant. What's inconsistant is the service. For example the last time I dined here with a group of friends the server seem to not care about our table, everything was slow, he never came by to check how we were doing with the food. When my female friend left, no one folded her napkin before she got back, while for another table, napkin was folded and the dish was covered to keep warm until the guest came back. The bread cart completely just skipped us too, which was a huge let down because their walnut bread is one of my favorite in the neighborhood. I understand even great restaurants have their off-days. However if I were to receive another treatment similar to the one I described above, I might have to disregard Bouley as one of the best french eatary in the city.",1
4439,490,5,6/16/2013,"My second time here. Have to get the 5 course tasting menu for lunch. The food was ethereal. The service was excellent. Chose the big eye tuna, porcini flan, beef cheeks, and caramelized pear. Due to a produce issue there was no choice for the 4th course instead we were given a set almond flavored ice cream(?) on a bed of slice strawberries. The almond ice cream was delicious. The porcini flan portion did get a little smaller and the petite fours did get a bit less. Champagne was overpriced but what would you expect from a place like this. As Arnold said, I'll be back.",1
4440,490,3,6/15/2013,"Came here last month for its ""famous"" tasting menu. I have tried many upscale restaurants' tasting menus before and have to say when we walked out of there we were super disappointed because : 1) the tasting menu only had 6 courses and two of which were dessert and right after we sat down we were told one of the dessert courses is not available that night and would be swapped for ice cream with strawberries. Turned out the course was literally two scoups of ice cream with strawnerries. I mean ppl don't come to Bouley to eat something as simple as that !!! 2) the portions were tiny. Understand its a tasting menu but its the first time that me and my boyfriend both were unfull coming out of dinner. We didn't eat too much bread which is partly what this restaurant is known for i guess but then later realized that if you don't eat bread, just forget about the tiny portions with only 4 courses excluding dessert. 3) nothing special about the dishes. Each were good but nothing stunning 4) other places I been to make me feel like there were lots of surprises like the moma restaurant or Jungsik but not this one 5) caught a waiter pouring a full glass of red wine for himself that belonged to a table who sat next to us. Pretty pathetic. Not coming back here for another $500+ bill for sure.",1
4441,490,5,6/13/2013,"Discrete, polite, friendly and efficient service by the Bouley restaurant staff. We enjoyed the Tasting menu with a selection of wines by the glass chosen from the extensive list of fine wines. We particularly appreciated the delicate attention of the kitchen staff on this unique occasion.",1
4442,490,5,6/12/2013,"I love the $55 five course lunch deal at Bouley! Although there are other great lunch deals in the city, such as those at Jean-Georges and Boulud Sud, Bouley's tasting menu is definitely top notch. When you first walk into the restaurant, you'll enter a beautiful room with shelves that are lined with red and green apples. I love the decor! While I love everything on their menu, if I had to pick one, my favorite would be the Porcini Flan with Alaska Live Dungeness Crab and Black Truffle Dashi. I got it on my first visit to the restaurant and I have to admit that I thought it looked kind of strange because the flan was covered in black broth. However, once you take that first bite, you'll fall in love with it. I try to get something new every time I go back to Bouley, but this one is a must. The bread service is also outstanding. They serve bread that they actually make at the restaurant every morning and the butter that comes with the bread just melts in your mouth. There are a lot more servers than at most restaurants and all of them are very attentive. The sommelier is also knowledgeable. On my last trip to Bouley, he recommended a bottle of chardonnay that was exactly what we were looking for. I would definitely recommend Bouley to anyone looking to go to a restaurant that serves contemporary French cuisine.",1

4445,490,5,6/2/2013,"Great, pricey food as usual, but a little heavier, than say, Jean Georges. Â They took a group of 14 of us also, and service was friendly, and not too stiff. Â  The French castle-like interior was charming, and the service was impeccable, as there appeared to be more servers than diners",1
4446,490,5,6/2/2013,"For the most part places like this don't need reviews.. people will go just based on reputation alone. So for tips-- the lunch prix fixe is amazingly affordable for such a restaurant. The nonalcoholic drinks (for the pregnant folk out there.. or just the non-alcohol imbibers) are very very good. Pretty much everything on the prix fixe menu looked and/or tasted fantastic, I would've tried it all if I could. A word (and this is likely obvious to most) - a lot of the food is probably not appropriate for pregnant ladies-- but despite that I enjoyed the meal immensely. And of course, needless to say, service is fantastic.",1
4447,490,5,6/2/2013,Came back here again last week and still one of the best meals in town.,1
4448,490,5,5/30/2013,"Lunch here was pretty much perfection. The bread service is much appreciated, and something not offered by many restaurants any more, even the three-star variety. There are a few bargain pre-fixe deals in town at top rated restaurants, but I'd have to say that Bouley's is perhaps the best. The quality of food and service really can't be topped, and the room is unbelievably comfortable and welcoming.",1
4449,490,4,5/26/2013,"Absolutely charming! Bouley offers a beautiful setting and world-class service for that special meal...the tasting menu was perfect for a graduation lunch with the family. The food itself is absolutely delicious but not quite top-notch, in my opinion...at least, not quite on par with institutions like Guy Savoy or Le Bernardin. However, you won't be disappointed. The tomato and lobster amuse, dungeoness crab flan, asparagus with Comte foam and salmon (get it rare) were among my faves...but there was nothing more refreshing and fun than the strawberry and rhubarb pre-dessert with a generous quenelle of ice cream. In addition to the food, take your time in enjoying the stunning space. From the fresh apples in the entrance to the velvet-lined doorframe to the Diptique candles in the sumptuous women's restroom/lounge, Bouley is also a feast for the eyes.",1
4450,490,5,5/21/2013,"Went here for a special wedding anniversary. One walks out of many fine dining establishments in NYC feeling that they didn't quite deliver given the hype, that the food was ultimately a tad boring, or that the quality of entrees did not match that of the appetizers. Not so at Bouley. Given how often the tasting menu changes and how many reviews this place already has, I won't focus on listing specific menu items. Every dish was between very good and amazing. I also appreciate that they throw in a lot of extra dishes not listed on the menu, and they gave us an additional dessert to boot. The breads are absolutely to die for (don't miss the saffron one and the fig one, if they're available). The service is great, although I have seen friendlier/warmer waiters overall. There was quite a bit of foot traffic in front of our table at first, but that subsided. The place is classy, knows its identity, and will spoil you forever.",1
4451,490,5,5/16/2013,Experienced the tasting menu and it was fantastic. Â This is a great special occasion restaurant. The room is gorgeous. Â It took me right out of NYC straight to France. Â Every item was delectable and perfectly portioned. Â The staff is also incredible.,1
4452,490,5,5/15/2013,"Every aspect of a great restaurant was achieved here, and given all of that, the price was reasonable. Â We had lunch and ordered the tasting menu with the wine pairings ($55 per person for food and $55 per person for wine). Â The amuse bouche was a pleasant surprise. Â The bread cart (and the guy who tends it) was indeed a treat (I asked for olive oil and he brought not only that but a second kind of butter to taste.) Â The sommelier was knowledgeable and interested in helping us learn about the wines she served. Â The waiters and other staff were attentive and pleasant. Â The food was wonderful.",1
4453,490,5,5/11/2013,"This place is amazing. Its expensive but you walk out feeling that you definitely got your money's worth (as opposed to some places where you wonder why you just spent all this money). First of all the restaurant is beautiful. I felt like I was transported to France. Service is top notch and everyone is very friendly. You definitely won't feel out of place. Fine china is used and the cutlery is changed with every course. Â We went for lunch and ordered the tasting menu. I definitely recommend this because from what I understand, its exactly the same as their dinner menu but for a third of the price. Â The tasting menu is officially 5 courses but you get so much other food that it is almost double that amount. To be specific, we started off with two amuse bouches - a blue cheese mousse with some type of berry sauce and something else (not really sure how to describe it but it was amazing). Â They were definitely my favorite part of the entire experience. They also gave us a white cloud mousse before our last course, compliments of the chef. Â There was definitely some molecular gastronomy going on there because the mousse literally disappears as soon as it enters your mouth. There is a designated breadmaker who walks around with the most amazing selection of bread. My husband, who is bread-obsessed felt like he was in heaven. He loved the fig bread. I got the garlic bread which was pretty good too. Â After the meal is over they bring you some petit fours and chocolate. When you leave, they give you a complimentary gift - a slice of lemon cake that you can take home with you. Now for the actual menu. Here's what we ordered. I actually liked everything we both got so I'd recommend everything listed: Big Eye Tuna - this came with an apple mousse. Delicious though a tad bit sweet. Blini of Scottish Smoked Salmon - The blini was made of apples and the salmon was just delicious. This was definitely one of my favorites Black Cod Marinated with Pistachio Miso - An explosion of flavors. Porcini Flan - Delicious and very hearty. They don't skimp on the crab here. Organic Long Island Duck - Delicious. The polenta takes the flavor of the date sauce. Loved it. Slow Braised Kobe Beef Cheeks - The beef cheeks are braised for 16 hours and they literally melt in your mouth! Chilled Rhubarb Soup - I haven't had strawberries this amazing for a while Hot Valrohna Chocolate Souffle - Delicious this but after four courses, two amuse bouches, lots of bread, and the white cloud mousse I was reaching my breaking point. Hot Caramalized Anjou Pear - Delicious also. Just had a small bite because I was stuffed. Bottom line: Go this if you want an amazing meal and old school service all for an even more amazing price. Oh I almost forgot - ladies don't forget to visit the bathroom. Its fit for a queen.",1
2410,490,5,5/10/2013,"One of my favorite tasting menus, and the alcohol pairing actually isn't exhorbitant. When you first walk in, the foyer was full of shelves lined with apples - smelled great! There's a comfy lounge for cocktails at the front. Great ambiance. The bf loved the huge pastoral murals on the walls. Personally, I like that it wasn't so dark, and the artful floral arrangements made it feel like we were in an outdoor garden. There is a guy who wheels around a bread cart, and apparently the bread is all baked in house. I liked the pistachio and the traditional sourdough. For starters, the wellfleet oysters were okay, wish we went with the mushrooms instead. The sea urchin terrine, texture-wise is mushy on top of mushy, but it all works and is delicious. The crab and porcini flan definitely outshone the langoustine, which was really small. I stuck to the miso cod and didn't have much of the farm egg due to my cheese aversion. The fish was flaky and nicely marinated, and not as sickly sweet as miso cods usually are. Meats, the lamb was presented in multiple ways, all delicious. I really liked the onion and mint purees. The duck was very tender. WOW the desserts. I hvae a huge sweet tooth and I was feeling a bit overwhelmed. Sadly, we didn't get rhubarb soup, guess they were out? The warm chocolate cake was luxuriously rich, and the pineapple souffle was super light and fluffy. But the real winner was the white chocolate cloud. This amazingly puffy creation has some give when you put a fork to it, but it instantly melts in your mouth. It is honestly a little slice of heaven.. By the time the petit fours came around, I was done. This is probably the first time ever I was unable to finish all the sweets :( Great experience. The portions are nicely sized and dishes nicely timed so that you never feel super stuffed or overwhelmed or gross. Attentive service as well. Will definitely be revisiting in the future.",1
4454,490,5,4/29/2013,"This place was AMAZING! This is my favorite place to date. Be ready to intoxicated by the fragrant smell of fresh REAL apples which decorates the wall when you first walk into the restaurant. What a clever idea to create a modern rustic ambience for patrons of the restaurant! My fiance and I came here for lunch and ordered all I listed below from the tasting menu (scroll all the way down). My fiance is not a fan of seafood but he loved everything we got with the exception of the big eye tuna where the texture was too ""FISH"" for him. So hey, if you are not a seafood fan, try the high quality fancy seafood here and you will become a fan! My personal favorites were Porcini Flan, Blini of Scottish Smoked Salmon, and the Kobe Style Beef Cheeks. We got the Chicken on recommendation as a personal favorite of our server. While it was cooked to perfection, I did not like the flavor. It tasted a little too ""green"" for me. All the desserts were to die for. Just when we thought we were done with our meal, we were brought a slew of petit fours. Chocolates, macarons, etc! Overall the food was so elegant, light, and the flavors perfect leaving you wanting for more and more! I was so sad when our last course came out! Not one dish was over sauced or over prepared. The servers were extremely attentive. After each course, our plates and silverware were immediately whisked away and we were brought our next course. We were also given fresh slices of bread baked in house, Â with sexy ingredients such as olives, figs, apricot, currants, pistachio, etc. You get to choose which and how many slices you want. Try them all if you'd like! They slice the bread in front of you :) I highly recommend taking your sweetheart here and ask for a table by the back. I loved where we sat. The decor was vintage chic with a library of vintage books. Our table had a nice vase with David Austen Garden Roses (which is one of my favorite flowers!) I just loved the romantic ambiance of this place!

4455,490,4,4/29/2013,"Everyone in the business has an off night and unfortunately, I was the one that fell short of the grandiose experience @ Bouley. Â Aside from the accommodating service, knowledgeable sommelier, and exquisite plating, the food was so-so. Â My guests and I had tastes of the below ranging from my favorite to least: ""Organic Connecticut Farm Egg"" - DEF come back here for this!!! Black Truffle, 24 Month ComtÃ© Cloud ""Japanese True Kobe Mille-feuille""- DEF come back here for this but is not served a la carte! Toasted Garlic, FrisÃ©e, Carrot, Tumeric ""Organic Long Island Duck"" - Frenchies know how to cook DUCK! Golden organic Dates, Hudson Valley Polenta, Confit of Young Clementines ""Porcini Flan"" - The textures and essence was nostalgic of a great Shark Fin soup! Dungeness Crab, Black Truffle Dashi ""Forager's Treasure of Wild Mushrooms"" - Interesting as the toro gave it structure/backbone Sweet Garlic, Grilled Toro, Black Truffle Dressing ""Fresh Malibu Sea Urchin Terrine""- VERY FRESH ""Spanish Sea Cucumber & Live Scottish Langoustine""- Washington State Prawns, Ocean Herbal Broth ""Hot Valrhona Chocolate SoufflÃ©"" - Perfectly balanced between sweet and bitter. White Coffee Cloud, Coffee Ice Cream, Chocolate Mousse ""Bergamot, Passion Fruit & Pineapple SoufflÃ©""- Very Refreshing Pistachio Melting Core, 10 Exotic Flavor Sorbet BELOW THIS POINT, the courses become less memorable. ""Chatham Day Boat Lobster"" - Perfectly cooked lobster Morels, Asparagus, Pinot Noir Sauce ""Chilled Rhubarb Soup""- Loved the gelato Organic Strawberries, Buckwheat Gelato ""Tangerine, Clementine, Mandarin Parfait w. Lychee Sorbet""- GOOD ""Organic Colorado Rack of Lamb ""En Cocotte"""" - Perfectly cooked lamb Soubise of Cipollini, Zucchini Mint PurÃ©e ""Wild King Salmon"" - Nicely cooked Tasmanian Mustard, Romanesco ""Pistachio Miso Marinated Fresh Black Cod""- Regular piece of cod! ""Cape Cod Oysters"" - Unfortunately, this was my start of my meal. Â Def not chilled. Chilled with Kiwi and Hyssop Just speaking for this night, the creativity did not translate to amazing tasting foods for me. Â I found 75% of the courses under seasoned but I'm sure they are just allowing fresh ingredients to speak for itself. Â The only revelation of the night was the wine pairing. Â I actually found a Riesling and Pinot Noir that I enjoyed or should I say loved. Â Food, in my books was only 3.5 but everything else pushed it up to 4. Â Chef Bouley is a innovative and talented chef so any rating less than 4 is unjustified. Â Will be back.....one day!",1
4456,490,4,4/24/2013,"Went for lunch and had the prix fixe. It was nothing short of absolutely astounding. The environment was very comfortable without being too stuffy. Each course was very well designed and packed several complimentary flavors. At $55 for the prix fixe, it is probably the most value I've ever gotten from a nice restaurant. Definitely recommended!",1
4457,490,5,4/21/2013,"Amazing. Â Period. Â Tasting menu and wine pairing was the schnizzle. Â I can't even list all the courses and extras, but it was impressive. Â Service was excellent; friendly and professional at the same time. Â Step up and do it!",1
4458,490,5,4/18/2013,"My first time at Bouley was with my girlfriend for Easter brunch. I definitely earned major points with her but now I am in trouble to find a better place to go ...! Incredible mushroom selection! I was still skeptical that the restaurant could be so good and come back today. Boom!!! Perfect again! The waiter and all the crew was really friendly. Japanese pie melts in your mouth without you even noticing. Incredible! Only 10 calories! They only use coconut sugar and organic products. Chef Bouley makes sure that he serves only health ingredients! Well, to make sure is good I will check the reataurant a third time bringing back my loved ones girlfriend and family!",1
4459,490,5,4/16/2013,"This restaurant completely and totally transcends any sort of earthly culinary experience. Seriously. Came for Easter Brunch, and let me tell you...brunch will never again be the same. I have never in my life been able to sit through a 6 course tasting and say I loved every bit- until now! Have had way more expensive tasting that couldn't even touch Bouley. Not to mention the interior is equally as mystical. Bouley is wonderland on earth!",1
4460,490,4,4/14/2013,"I came here for lunch before heading out to the Armory Show. Bouley is an interesting french restaurant with a French countryside feel to it. Right when you open the front door you get hit with a strong smell of ripe sweet apples in the waiting room. In this room, REAL apples are displayed along the wall from top to bottom. Bouley has possible the best value prix fixe 5 course menu for a Michelin star restaurant in NYC. The service is attentive without being overwhelming. Most of the diners were wining and dining business clients. I really enjoyed the bread cart with some very interesting ingredients. NEGATIVE 1 STAR (David Bouley PLEASE READ): I overheard a threatening conversation where the bald ""white"" waiter in the suit told one of the Hispanic back waiters ""...I'm going to fuck you up!"" Seriously is this really necessary for the bald guy to be a douche? The back waiters work very hard and the pompous bald guy in the suit walked around as if he was too important to lift a finger. Please get rid of this bald guy in the suit and get someone that is able to work at your restaurant without causing drama in front of the customers.",1

Â Very romantic, but we we felt a little uncomfortable with the couple sitting next to us who went a little too far with their affections and should have been at a hotel room instead. Â Made our dinner experience a little weird, but didn't deter from the amazing experience we had in this most exquisite restaurant. Â A must when in New York.",1
4462,490,5,4/12/2013,"We had lunch earlier today and have been here for lunch once last year as well. Â We enjoyed ourselves so much.

4463,490,5,4/7/2013,"Came here for a random nice romantic dinner From start to finish the place was beautiful with incredible service We ordered the dinner tasting menu with the wine pairings. Every dish was so tongue boggling. Each dish had such a brilliant combo of flavors. The staff was very polite and accommodating bc I can be very particular about wine and service. And Â to end the great night -The staff gave us a nice little box of French chocolates on the way out the door Def recommend this restaurant to everyone,",1
4464,490,5,4/5/2013,"This is hands down the best restaurant in Tribeca. Â The lunch special is so worth the money and a great deal! Highly recommend the porcini flan with crab and truffle. Â The chicken is so tender, it melts in your mouth. Â I heard they slow cook the chicken.",1
4465,490,5,4/3/2013,"An amazing restaurant with impeccable staff and great food! My wonderful boyfriend made reservations for us for my birthday! The place was very old world fancy and elegant. Each course was delivered with precision and grace along with explanation by our server and a change in utensils by another gentleman. Homemade fresh bread as you please with about 10 different variations to choose from. Â We were seated in a love seat chair tucked away in a little alcove which made my experience more intimate and private. We had the tasters Prix Fixe with 5 courses and it says 5 courses but it's really like 8! I don't know... all i know is that the food was fantastic! I don't even remember the name of everything, but I got the the dishes with dungeness crab, a tartare with 3 different types of fish, the kobe beef cheeks, desserts, we also were given this really good soup (maybe rhubard) and served some type of crispy cracker with truffle to pair with the soup and it was amazing! It didn't sound appetizing in description to us, but it was delicious and I would definitely get it again! I also received a creme brule for my birthday and it was so yummy! It was a great way to spend my birthday lunch before my birthday dinner with friends! We also had mini french macarons and other little cookies that I was able to have wrapped up because I was full beyond belief! I definitely recommend and I would come here again :) p.s. formal attire and jackets for men is required, but it's nice to dress up! :)",1
4466,490,3,4/1/2013,"I was in NYC recently to treat myself to some solo fine dining and, thanks to fellow Yelpers, I put Bouley on my list to visit. Â  I liked: the decor (too ostentatious for home, but great for this restaurant); the comfortable seating (I sat on a bench along a wall); the overall comfortable ambience of the place (like a renovated Provencal estate); the champagne cocktail aperitif (I have no idea what was in it other than champage, but it was delicious); the Scottish langoustine dish (so I guess I like sea cucumber); and the box of chocolates on my way out (I snacked on those for a few days). What I thought was just okay: the 12 course chef's tasting menu. Â Admittedly, I was being greedy. Â I didn't want to have to choose between, say, the sea urchin terrine and the oyster with kiwi. Â But I've done long tasting menus previously, with a wine pairing, and I've gotten to the last dish and still been excited. Â Here I was bored half way through, and I kind of wanted it to be over. Â I like an interesting CO2-infused dish, but I found it to be too much on this menu; I needed more substance to most of the dishes, and what I got was foam. What got a raised eyebrow from me: One of the waiters was overly familiar with me. Â I know that I was solo dining, and my experience has been that the waitstaff might be a little less formal with me, which I don't typically dislike. Â Here, however, one of the waiters didn't seem to understand that there is a line, and I found him to be rather leering. Â Luckily, he was not the waiter with whom I spent most of my night. So, overall, I'm glad I visited it but, in retrospect, I wouldn't have insisted on getting the chef's tasting menu.",1
4467,490,4,3/25/2013,"The lunchtime tasting menu at Bouley is one of the best values in fine dining. For $55 you receive a duo of amuse bouches, the five courses, some additional gifts from the chef, the largest bread selection I have ever seen (ten different offerings) and mignardises. The cheese cart looked beautiful but one would have to have a gargantuan appetite to have room (there is a supplement of around $24 for a cheese course). A nice perk is there is a few choices for each course (a couple incur a surcharge, but plenty are included). This is not a venue where they scale things down for lunch. The cuisine appears to be a fusion of classic and contemporary French and great care is taken with the plating and presentations. In addition to the value, the next best thing about Bouley is the architecture and decor; the upstairs (reception area and main dining room) resembles a French Chateau and the downstairs (wine cellar, bathrooms and smaller dining room) felt like being inside a castle. Boulet was renovated last year and is beautiful and grand. Lots of great aromas between the shelves filled with fresh apples in the entryway and the myriad of fresh flowers throughout the dining room; Â the wood burning fire adds to the elegance and the thick cushioned chairs are luxurious. The only oddity was the stalls in the men's room also have chairs inside them across the commode; I was very curious what that was about, but was afraid to ask. This was a hearty, rich, filling meal and I am starting to realize that on average tasting menus in New York have far bigger portions than where I reside (Chicago). As my wife and I have robust appetites this is certainly a positive but I could see some becoming overly stuffed before the end of the meal; definitely come hungry and be prepared for a leisurely lunch (we were there for just under two hours). There is also an a la carte menu, but the value lies in the tasting menu; some entrees a la carte cost nearly as much as the full tasting menu and the tasting menu has so many great options that you are not settling for an inferior menu by any means. The food overall was quite good but just not as memorable as other high end venues I have recently visited. My favorite course was the tuna sashimi with caviar in a lemon foam; great contrast of favors and textures. It looked similar to Per Se's famous Oysters and Pearls and I really enjoyed this dish. There were certainly no duds, but nothing else left me feeling wowed. Service is attentive and polished but just a tad overly formal for my taste. While our primary server was excellent; jovial, energetic and helpful in making a couple of accommodations to the menu the rest of the staff was strictly all about business. My favorite fine dining venues have a more laid back vibe that makes the meal not just about exemplary food, but an overall fun experience. I am happy to have had the opportunity to dine at Bouley and for $55 this was a steal, but the dinner menu does not appear all that different and at approximately three times the price I likely would not have felt as satisfied.",1
4468,490,4,3/24/2013,"So one of the companies who develops networking equipment had a beer tasting here. I expected to go in and sit through a sales pitch and then have a few beers and be done. Since I thoroughly enjoy good beer, I figured it would be worth the business pitch. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there wasn't a sales pitch, the food kept coming out, and the beer was endless. The beers were good (always enjoy a 3 Philosophers), and left feeling pretty good. The food was hit or miss for me, but the dessert was incredible (maybe I have a sweet tooth). The floor space was very nice, and the staff well informed and friendly.",1
4469,490,5,3/24/2013,"I came here for an anniversary date with my girlfriend and it was an AMAZING experience! From the food to the decor and service, everything was just better than I even imagined. When we arrived we walked into the front door and into a small room full of apples on the wall. The room smelled like ... well ... APPLES! It was very pungent. We were greeted and taken downstairs past the main dining room into a private room. I had requested this via OpenTable and I'm glad they answered that request because it made the dinner extremely romantic. The downstairs private room was like a warm, cozy living room beautifully decorated. We had mainly 2 men serve us and their service was absolutely some of the best I've ever encountered. Although they hovered around our table alot, I know it was so that we were as comfortable as possible and that they could attend to any of our questions. We didn't order from the prix fix menu and instead ordered from the a la carte menu. I won't comment too much on the food as you should well know it's fine dining and all you really have to know is it's going to be DEEELICIOUS! I will make a few comments about the food overall and that is (1) they served us MANY dishes (for free) on top of what we ordered! I think we counted 4-5 extra dessert dishes on top of the desserts we ordered! And to top it off, they brought out a special HAPPY ANNIVERSARY dish for us with a candle in the middle. We had spoken to one of our servers earlier and told him we were here for an anniversary and it was very thoughtful of him. (2) One of the entrees we ordered was the All-Natural Pennsylvania Chicken and the server brought out the whole chicken and did a small showing of it to us. The experience was definitely one of the most romantic I've ever had and I highly recommend it to anyone celebrating a special occasion! Although I've read that they encourage people not to take pictures of their food here, they WILL take pictures of you if you like. Also, we did take a picture of our HAPPY ANNIVERSARY dessert, but with the flash off. One last comment is the dress code for men. Every male was wearing a jacket, but not everyone was wearing a tie, which was a relief to me as I was not wearing one :)",1

The service was exceptional...we felt so welcomed and were really well attended throughout the dinner. Everyone seemed genuinely happy to be serving us. Food was phenomenal too and every course was perfection - from the bread cart (it is literally a cart), to the organic chicken entree (so tender!). We received so many complementary dishes too - a plate of hor dourves each and 2 desserts each! It was expensive sure, but there's no such thing as cheap fine dining. Decor was very quaint with beautiful curtain drapings and dome ceiling. We will definitely be back to celebrate a special occasion!",1

Right when you walk in you are welcomed by the smell of the wall of apple, the dining room was filled with what a french dining room ought to have - arts, french speaking servers, cheese and bread carts...downstairs wine cellar was cool and the private dining room makes me feel I'm far away from Manhattan....I really for a moment thought I was in Paris... The wine list I tought have some room for improvement....only 2 champagnes on the by glass selection is a little low...but it didn't bother me that much... The bread cart had like 10 different choices and the breadmaker was very kind in explaining the varieties and cutting them by order... By the time petit four came...I was already so full and had no room for any more sweets... After a 2+ hour lunch we were given a bag with a lemon cake as our gift...again impressed...I am a BIG Bouley fan..",1
4471,490,5,3/17/2013,"Amazing, do it! My hubby took me here for my birthday. Loved the beautiful French ambiance with groin vaulted ceilings and swags of silk drapery. I loved how the atmosphere was calm without people blowing in and out of the restaurant, on cell phones, etc. It's a formal place and I think that's a good thing especially for a special occasion or if you simply value your company and want to have a lovely dining experience. We enjoyed the the amuse bouche, a frothy bisque. I ordered the sea bass- so fresh! We thought the coffee was excellent, they rolled over a cart with all kinds of bread offerings that including everything from olive bread, sourdough and breads with fruit and cheese. The desserts were to die for. They brought out a birthday treat with with well wishes written in chocolate. They had me at chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream! The service was impeccable and formal. The sommelier made some great recommendations too. Â This is a great place to take a client, parents, date or anyone you would like to impress.",1
4472,490,5,3/16/2013,"Top notch dining experience on every level. Entry way is lined with a wall of fresh apples that create a wonderful aroma. We were immediately greeted by the coat check girl who took our coats and escorted us to the hostess station. We waited for only a minute in the cozy waiting area until seated. The dining room is elegant but not stuffy like some other upscale French restaurants in the city. We were treated like VIP's by the unpretentious waitstaff, who pampered us the entire night. Service is fussy here, and it got hard to hold a private conversation without being interrupted by one of the two dozen waitstaff stopping by to explain the complimentary chef's dishes, or offer more wine. They have a bread cart with easily ten different unique artisan loaves, like saffron walnut, olive rosemary, and apricot walnut, and we enjoyed conversation with the charming server. The chef offers two complimentary appetizers and three complimentary desserts. All were praise worthy. The crab flan had multidimensional flavor, and the oysters with Meyer lemon cream were to die for. I had the lobster in Italian mandarin pomegranate sauce and hubby had the medium rare sirloin with spinach and potato. The entrees were divine. For dessert, I had the lemon tart and hubby had the amaretto flan. Both came with two types of homemade ice cream. Though they were wonderful, I wouldn't have ordered them if I knew about the two complimentary desserts and the dolce platter. We were stuffed but very happy. They even gave us a small pound cake to enjoy for breakfast! We celebrated our eighth anniversary here and plan to return for more happy occasions.",1
4473,490,5,3/11/2013,"There isn't much I can say beyond what others have said, but I will reiterate that the restaurant is pretty extraordinary. You feel lavish all the way from the beginning when you walk into the apple room to the tasting menu and elegant place to the little complimentary chocolates at the end of the meal. One caveat is that if you're sitting on the lower level, you don't have the bread cart. Someone comes down to give you the different types of bread, but he only carries 3 different types, so we didn't get to try all the different flavors. Given how much I read about the bread, that was certainly disappointing. The service is phenomenal. The waiters are all very knowledgeable, courteous, and clearly willing to help throughout the entire 3 hour meal. You definitely don't feel rushed. The restaurant was also willing to exchange some drinks when we found out they were way too strong in certain tastes such as ginger or spice. The price is also very reasonable. At $55, for the essentially 8-course tasting menu, it's practically a steal...well not that quite that good, but close to it. Fantastic dining experience, since it is an experience and not just a meal, for sure.",1

4476,490,5,2/27/2013,"I've been here twice (this past summer) - once for lunch on a Saturday with a fairly big group (8 of us?) and once with my fiancÃ© for dinner. I opted for the tasting menu both times (since I loved it so much the first time). The food was great both times but the value you get during lunch is significantly better (I think we each paid $90 for lunch and had ordered 2 bottles of wine; on the other hand, the total bill for dinner was over $500!). First, the atmosphere is phenomenal. It is old school French but so beautiful (the space itself with its high ceilings is stunning). Second, the service is attentive but a tad stuck up. Third, the food is outstanding. I can't remember what everyone else ordered but I remember I started with the treasure of wild mushrooms (delicious with foam) and ended with a truffle gnocchi (doesn't appear to be on the menu anymore but it was phenomenal). The chocolate soufflÃ© is to die for!! The little dishes they keep bringing out and the selection of breads were great too. I remember a lot of these small dishes having truffle - no one complained about this of course! Bottom line: Go for Saturday lunch and opt for the tasting menu.",1

Â From the two amuses to the amazing bread cart, to the three desserts...great refinement and presentation. Â The service is only a bit on the stuffy side. Â Men are required to wear jackets, which is strange nowadays but not entirely unpleasant. Â  The lunch tasting menu was an great value.

3306,490,5,2/18/2013,"One of my favorite restaurants in NYC! (or of all time!) My fiance took me here this past Monday, President's day weekend, to celebrate our recent engagement/ 23rd month anniversary/ Valentine's day! I've been wanting to try this restaurant for months and the earliest reservation we were able to get a hold of was 2:15PM! So I studied the menu extensively, read up on all the yelp reviews, and refused to eat all morning knowing that we would stuff our face silly and would take advantage of the $55 tasting menu - btw amazing deal (they even offer this on Sat!). We arrived around 2:20 and there was a lady by the coat check (right at the entrance with the apple shelf) ready to take our coats! We walked right in and was greeted by the hostess who had our table all ready for us. Our waiter was extremely friendly and congrated us before we could even get into our seats. The interior of the restaurant was gorgeous! I couldn't help but kept turning (they seated me where I was facing the window) around to take it all in! We didn't get our menus for a good 5 mins, so I also kept turning to eye the breadcart. The waiter returned and asked us several times if we're interested in getting wine or champagne especially since we're here to celebrate such important occasion! My fiance and I are not much of a drinker so we politely refused. Before we could finish placing our order, our free amuse bouche (beet soup? + cracker with cheese + caviar) were nicely presented to us. They started us off with apple raisin bread and healthier tasting roll. I quickly stuffed my face because they were both so warm and yummy and I must clear my plate before asking for more! Our first course came and the bread gentleman rolled his cart towards us shortly afterward. The bread cart consisted of garlic, olive, black current, pistachio+hazelnut, apricot + walnut, fig etc bread. I had 1 of each except for the garlic and olive. My favs ended up being the apricot+walnut and fig. Ok enough back to our main tasting. I ordered the oysters (which wasn't extremely memorable and amazing) and my fiance ordered the tuna (they didn't have skate that day and wasn't presented Mediterranean style - the tuna ended up being placed on top of a citrusy foam) which I thought tasted amazing. I ended up dipping my pistachio bread into his leftover foam to soak up all the sauces! Our second courses took a little longer. I ordered the flan (overloaded with crab meat! - and tasted somewhat Asian-y) and my fiance ordered the black cod. Both so so so so good. His dish again had a sour/citrous-y kick to it. This time I dipped my apricot bread in his leftover sauce. Before our third course, they surprised us with a complimentary mushroom appetizer (also a choice on their tasting menu). Very light but so tasty. Again I smothered my bread with the leftover truffle oil and sauces on the plate. We left nothing behind. By this time, my fiance and I already felt somewhat full. But of course I eyed the bread gentleman to come on over and load my plate with 3 additional slices of fig bread :). Our entrees came shortly afterward. My fiance ordered the beef cheek with blue kale gnocchi and I ordered the duck. My duck was a little undercooked (a little less cooked than medium rare) but I loved it. I'm not the type that really care about how my meat is cooked. as long as it's not dry or burnt, I'm totally okay with it. The sweet sauce was just perfect. My fiance took a bite and really wished he had ordered my dish. His beef cheek was delicious (I actually finished the gnocchi for him) but definitely a heavier dish than mine. With our main entrees, each came with 2 side dishes of red wine + mushroom risotto and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes was like crack! So buttery and creamy. My fiance was Â too stuffed by then so I happily ate both his side dishes for him. (I sacrifice my figure for him a lot) Onto our sweets. I initially ordered the rhubarb soup. My fiance ordered the peach soup. After taking the initial bite, my fiance decided that his dish was way too sweet and we swapped. I have the sweetest tooth so I had no problem with his dish. So yummy! I wish the portion was bigger. I swear even though we were both so full, we just have a total different stomach for sweets. For our 5th course, I ordered the poached pear and my fiance ordered the chocolate souffles. It took a while for both to come out.. so I asked for more fig bread in the mean time (I have no self control). When they came out with our desserts, they surprised us with an additional dessert - lemon tart with passion fruit sorbet with the word congrat on top. Before the check came, they presented us with petit 4. Even tho the staff was busy preparing for dinner service by then, they came by and offered to take picture for us. The whole meal lasted about 3 hrs long. At the coat check, the hostess even gave us a wooden box of chocolate to go! Bouley has stolen my tummy and heart! 5 stars and I will beg to return!",1
1768,490,5,2/12/2013,had a wonderful time at bouley with a group of clients. loved the crisp smell of apples at the entrance and the food was delicious. really enjoyed the ambience of vaulted ceilings and candlelit dinner with fantastic service,1

4481,490,5,2/3/2013,"I am not even going to bother reviewing the food. Â Let me just say that there is a mastery here where every ingredient seem to be treated with equal care and their final result shows the genius of a perfectly executed meal. I have been visiting this very elegant restaurant for a couple of years now, have done lunch, dinners, and a lovely and memorable champagne infused brunch. Â Every time the staff is very attentive, and helpful. Â Their wine selection is spectacular, and as expected so are their prices. If you come here in jeans, you will not feel welcomed. Â This is not a place to come and be seen, nor it is a place for someone with limits in their credit card. Â They are not snobs, but are the class of old world restaurant that have high standards for food and service. Â Be forewarned, if you are not accustomed to spend a few hundred dollars per person for lunch, then you may feel intimidated by this place. Try their tasting menu, and ask their sommelier to do a pairing. Â Fabulous! Someday, I dream of sitting at the chef's table.",1
1895,490,5,2/3/2013,"Frank Bruni once asked if anyone could explain David Bouley. For all my propensity towards eerily accurate assessments of people, I could sadly do no better than he. Having just recently been to Brushstroke, M and I were excited to patronize another jewel of Mr. Bouley's empire. Not really part of the boozy brunch crowd, we opted for a weekend five course lunch. In a first for me, I decided to peruse the photos of the food on offer, and I must admit, the photographer/food stylists made each item look phenomenal. A bit lavish at times, but for the most part, the ingredients seemed to be given leeway to speak for themselves. I wondered if this approach would be extended in all facets of Bouley. Gaudy, in a quintessentially old-world French sort of way, the decor will ingratiate itself with some and incense others. Whatever rustic charms afforded to one by the bounty of apples in the foyer are quickly dissipated in the face of the gilded, well, everything, idyllic landscape paintings notwithstanding. The candelabra-esque sconces, festooned with glass orbs resembling jewels, the imposing centerpieces, and the musty bookcases engage in a fight to the death to determine what can be found most ostentatious. And yet, when taken as a whole, as your affably Alsatian waiter beams upon carving open the bread lined pot containing what will soon be your chicken, you cannot help but smile in return, and enjoy the unabashed pomp for what it is. Mr. Bouley has his tastes, as do we all; this is not a backlash against the growing trend of minimalism (his own Brushstroke is rather sparse), but rather an affirmation of an aesthetic he enjoys. What remained to be seen was if in his attention to the visual he had neglected his cooking. In a word, no. I began with a Big Eye Tuna Carpaccio, a dish described as prepared in a Mediterranean manner, and a dish that subsequently outshone its humble billing. A surprisingly delicate dill infused aioli served as a creamy foundation for the slices of kampachi, tuna, and amber jack as slivers of olive intermingled with the olive oil, providing a delightfully substantial brine for the proceedings. M's Smoked Salmon and Apple Blini were greater than the sum of their description as well. I worried that when combined with the still lingering aroma of apples from our entrance, the apple would be too much for the subtler ingredients. However, the white truffle honey managed to be just the earthy sweetness required to complement the salinity of the roe and the meatiness of the salmon. That interplay was merely a prelude to my next dish, the Forager's Treasure of Wild Mushrooms. Treasure, in this case, was no exaggeration. In lightly grilling the toro, Mr. Bouley's whimsy and ingenuity were on full display, as the textures and savory flavors of each, now verging on interchangeability, were accented beautifully by the brightness of the sprouts and the gentle acidity of the cream foam. M would contest that her Porcini Flan, a heady melange of humble dashi, rich dungeness crab, and funky black truffle was just as worthy of the ""Treasure"" moniker. It was odd then, that the two following dishes, presented so lovingly, did not contain the same depth of flavor. My Roasted Long Island Duck did indeed evoke winter, and both the accompanying polenta and huckleberry puree tasted rather good, but the herb coulis did not taste as herbaceous as it looked, and felt a bit lost in the shuffle. M's Pennsylvania Chicken 'En Cocotte', as captured succinctly by the steam escaping its hay lined pot, seemed a little deflated on arrival. The chicken, while both moist and subtly smoky, rested on a bed of underwhelmingly average blue kale. That is not to say that either entree was bad: far from it. However, each had missteps in the form of extraneous additions keeping them from the heights of our earlier plates. Dessert, on the other hand, rose back to the previous peaks. Both the rhubarb and peach soups were stunningly light, an omage to the coming spring through fruits which would only now have begun to be planted. The icebergs of buckwheat gelato and amaretto ice cream that floated among them were two means to the same goal of full-bodied intricacy. My Varlhona Chocolate Souffle was an even more impactful lesson on intricacy, as chocolate's full spectrum of sweetness, bitterness, coarseness and silkiness were on display. Â M's Caramelized Anjou Pear was as cleverly deconstructed a tart as I've come across. The exceedingly generous mignardises seemed too plentiful to believe, and I genuinely believe that had we asked for more, we'd have been given them. That said, asking for more is unlikely, given the portions of the earlier dishes. Restaurants are generally too risky a venue from a subjectivity standpoint to make sweeping proclamations, but I have no qualms in guaranteeing that Bouley will satisfy. I may not be able to explain the man, eccentric and frustrating as he can be, but his food has been beyond reproach.",1
4482,490,5,2/3/2013,The tasting menu was delicious!,1
4483,490,4,2/1/2013,"My mom ate at one of the iterations of Bouley during a trip to NYC in the 90s. So she was really enthusiastic about going again. It was our big splurgy meal night during our week in the city. I loved the interior. We were seated downstairs, and we loved it. The interior was like something out of a Merchant-Ivory film. She ordered a tasting menu with wine pairing. The service was decent. Our sommelier, at first, was very curt. She offered only vague descriptions of the wines, probably because we looked -- I dunno -- not like wine aficionados? Looks can be deceiving. I am not, but my mother is. During one of the perfunctory descriptions, my mom dropped some kind of crazy wine knowledge bomb and suddenly, the sommelier's entier demeanor changed. She was amazing! Suddenly she became engaging and charming. It was great! The food was truly amazing. I had a savory aspic terrine (I'm probably slaughtering the description) -- It was delicious. There was lamb, there were sardines and it was all perfectly cooked. Yay for fancy dining.",1
4484,490,5,1/30/2013,"This place was simply great!! My bf and I spent our 8-yr anniversary dinner here and we had a perfect night. Service was impeccable. Love love the decor! Food was amazing as well! Â  Here's what we had: Appetizer: North Carolina Pink Shrimp & Cape Cod Sea Scallops - Â fresh, tasty seafood! Porcini Flan - this was amazing!! Â  Entree: Venison - cooked to perfection! Long island duck - very tender duck! Desserts: Tree Ripened Golden Hawaiian Pineapple SoufflÃ©: very sweet but taste good! Before we left they gave us a lemon loaf for the next day. How thoughtful! Enjoyed this place! Def one of the best restaurants in NYC!",1

4487,490,5,1/16/2013,"Invited here for a business lunch, nbd :) Had the lunch tasting menu, for a very affordable $55: Carpaccio of Kampachi, Big Eye Tuna, and Striped Amber Jack Black Cod Marinated with Pistachio Miso Organic Long Island Duck Roasted Whole with Winter Spice Mix Kingston NY White Peach Soup Hot Caramelized Anjou Pear There were also a couple of amuse-bouches that I didn't quite remember the exact composition, but of course they were delicious. Be sure to try the pistachio hazelnut bread from the cart if it is available. In terms of the service, there's nothing to be said that hasn't already been said by everyone else - impeccable service, polite helpful staff, beautiful ambiance. The outside facade was just recently remodeled and looks very nice. Be sure to stop by next door on the way out for a peek into their kitchen!",1
2889,490,5,1/13/2013,"A friend and I took another friend here for his birthday. The venue is extremely well maintained and nice, from the entryway to the waiting area to the dining area itself. We were treated very well throughout the meal, although service is a tad bit on the stuffier side. We started with a bottle of wine (with which our glasses were constantly refilled by waitstaff) and ordered the wild mushroom appetizer while merely inquiring about the black truffle dashi. The appetizer came with complimentary orders of the dashi, which was very much appreciated. A server came around with at least seven different types of bread, all of which were delicious, especially the fig bread (the sweet ones were my preference), and he was very friendly and engaging while serving us. For my main course, I had the lamb, which was prepared really well and was just delicious. Various complimentary dishes came throughout the meal, all of which were delicious, although my favorite was the bulgur wheat ice cream that came before dessert. I had the pear dessert, which was quite nice, while my friends each had the Chocolate Frivolous, and they weren't kidding when they said that one would have been enough for two. It's quite an overwhelming amount of chocolate, especially when combined with the birthday lemon tart they brought and various other small sweets they brought to close out the meal. Overall, the food was outstanding and the service great. It would be a bit overwhelming to come back often, but it would definitely be worth a return visit for a special occasion.",1
4488,490,4,1/10/2013,"This review is for the $55 lunch tasting menu (plus the $55 wine pairing). Â Beautiful setting, very ornate. Â Very good food with some exceptional items. Â We loved the porcini flan, all the desserts, the salmon, and the bread (seriously amazing bread cart). Â The big negative for us was the service. Â I think they just had an off day, but for a Michelin star restaurant they were a bit of a mess. Â Nothing awful, just nothing special and a few times waiting for things or being rushed into courses while others in the restroom. Â One thing to note - if you are into wine, the pairing is great. Â Interesting stuff that we never would have ordered.",1

Excellent cheese cart. Well worth the money!",1
4489,490,1,1/4/2013,"I do not often write yelp reviews, but my experience tonight at Bouley was the most underwhelming NY dining experience in 5+ years. Â If you want good food in Tribeca, go to Marc Forgione which is not even in the same ball park as Bouley. Â Why anybody would travel to go here when there are so many fantastic options in NY (Jean Georges!?) astounds me. My husband and I decided to try Bouley for his 30th birthday. Â We expected an exceptional experience based on the Bouley reputation. Â When I made the reservations, I made it clear that we were celebrating my husband's 30th birthday (this is a milestone!). Â Upon arriving, we were escorted to the poorly decorated basement. Â This might not bother most people, but I was in decor hell. Â The sconces clash terribly with the chandeliers (think big sur style paired with new jersey housewives gaudy glam...does not work..at all). Â And don't even get me started on the cartoony vases with the easter egg colored rose bouquets. Â This was redeemed by the diptyque holiday candles burning everywhere (good choice), but I am concerned that this was a seasonal choice and will be replaced with bath and body works sparkling strawberry come spring. Â  Break Down: Cleanliness: (this would not normally be a factor because good restaurants are clean) Â There were fruit flies swarming our table. Â I am not dining outdoors in Anguilla. Â This is a New York basement in January, and therefore NOT OK. Service: Empty wine glass for 20 minutes while waiting for dinner. Â  No birthday recognition in the form of: ""Happy birthday Mr. X"", ""let me stick a candle in the dessert you ordered, Mr. X"", etc. etc. Â Especially annoying given the only other occupied table in the basement was another birthday and the birthday girl was given a complimentary dessert with a candle. Â So sad. Flavor: I ordered the highly recommended signature dish...the Chicken. Â The chicken is moist but has no flavor. Â None. Â At all. Â I could chew on a soggy sponge for the same culinary experience. Â Actually, I could chew on 500 soggy sponges for the cost of the dinner. Portion: Eat a full meal and then come here for snack time. Â  Conclusion: Jean Georges restaurants produce food that tastes really good! And they treat you well. Â And the decor is good! Go there instead. Â Or Gramercy Tavern! That's much better too! If you have a hankering for chicken, go to Marc Forgione-the chicken is WAY better.",1
4490,490,5,1/4/2013,"Divine food and service :) My best friend and I came here on a weekday and selected the five-course Lunch Tasting Menu for $55 per person and we were blown away. It is worth every penny and more. We had: Chilled Cape Cod Wellfleet Oysters with Organic Kiwi - a fantastic combination of sweetness, saltiness and tartness. Carpaccio of Kampachi, Big Eye Tuna and Striped Amber Jack - ohhh they melt in your mouth! so fresh and savory. Black Cod Marinated with Pistachio Miso - incredibly tender, but I think we should have one with the Forager's mushrooms instead. Porcini Flan with Alaska Live Dungeness Crab, Black Truffle Dashi - one of the big big highlights of the meal, they are so generous with the crab meat and ugh, oh so divine. my friend and I joked that we could die happy right there and then after finishing the flan. Organic Long Island Duck Roasted Whole Â - mmmm so darn delicious, this was another 'I can die happy now' moment :) Slow Braised Kobe Style Beef Cheeks - I'm not a fan of beef actually but my friend loved it and highly recommends it. Chilled Fall Rhubarb Soup - loved it. Kingston, NY White Peach Soup - was good but not as lovely as the rhubarb, maybe it's a preferential taste thing. Hot Valrhona Chocolate SoufflÃ© - divine once again. we were so full from all the food at this moment but goodness the chocolate and icecream? ugh so good. Hot Caramelized Anjou Pear - lovely as well. Throughout the meal, they would bring complimentary tastings of various dishes courtesy of the chef (thank you Bouley! you are too kind :)) So - a five course meal felt really more like a nine course. Oh gosh, and I nearly forgot to mention the BREAD CART! the bread (there were so many varieties) is utterly amazing and the bread man is so friendly and sliced the thinnest pieces of bread I've ever had. Again, the service is impeccable, the ambience est trÃ¨s franÃ§ais (we sat in a corner booth surrounded by books ;)) and Â I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. I am definitely coming back to try the dinner Â and bringing all my loved ones.",1

With the main dinning room still half empty when we arrived for our lunch reservation, we were escorted to the nearly empty basement with no windows. There was another table with disrupting kids that was causing some trouble for the Mom. I asked our waiter if we were able to sit in the main dinning room, he said only the basement is available. While it did not start out great, our server was attentive and the food is fine that's why the three star.",1
4492,490,5,12/26/2012,"An orgasmic dining experience! My man said it best - dining here felt like we were in France. We did the 6 course menu valued at $175. Our faves were Porcini flan and Chatham day boat lobster. The duck was so yummy with its honey glaze topping. Did I eat four desserts, even though I just ordered one?! A chocolate soufflÃ©, frozen creme brulee, pineapple souffle, and ice cream. Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you that they give you mini macaroons and cookies at the end. Â A fantastic dining experience! Sure you'll be moaning at the end due to all the delish food in your tummy and the also, when you get the check. Yes, it is super $$$ but there is no better place to splurge and expand your waistline. Until again, when I am in the mood... I hope to dine at Bouley again... I will try the pre-fix lunch as suggested by previous reviews.",1
4493,490,4,12/25/2012,"I really enjoyed my dining experience at Bouley. Bouley has an amazing prix fixe lunch. You need to make reservations well in advance to secure this delightful meal. You can choose a 5 course for $55 or 3 course for $49. My bf and I decided to choose the 3 course. We wanted to save room for an early dinner. 3 course actually was a lot of food, given all the 'extras' that came with the meal. 1st course: Forager's Treasure of Wild Mushrooms, Sweet Garlic, Special Spices Grilled Toro and a Black Truffle Dressing Porcini Flan Alaska Live Dungeness Crab, Black Truffle Dashi They were both excellent. The porcini flan was perfect given that it was like a warm soup. It was exactly what I needed for a rainy day in NYC. 2nd course: Black Cod Marinated with Pistachio Miso, Heirloom Tomatoes, Elderflower Homemade Raspberry Vinegar, Tonka Bean, Fresh Verbena Slow Braised Kobe Style Beef Cheeks, Blue Kale Gnocchi Again, both were delicious! the black cod was like butter. It just melted in your mouth. The slow braised Kobe beef cheeks were tender and very well seasoned. 3rd course: Hot Caramelized Anjou Pear, Valrhona Chocolate, Biscuit Breton, Hot Toffee Sauce Lemon Verbena and Tahitian Vanilla Ice Creams Hot Valrhona Chocolate SoufflÃ©, White Coffee Cloud, White Chocolate Ice Cream, Chocolate Mousse These desserts were good but did not blow me away. Service was outstanding. One of the most memorable things of Bouley is the women's restroom. It was very elegant and very French. The hostess could have been a bit friendlier. We asked her to take a picture for us next to their Christmas tree. She did not seem to open to it. She did help take our picture but was not a great picture. I deleted it. That was disappointing as it was the last impression we had of Bouley. However, despite that, I still had a great time.",1
4494,490,5,12/19/2012,"FANTASY BECOMES REALITY My troubles and anxieties disappear when I daydream of the fragrant fresh apples you walk by and sniff as you enter Restaurant Bouley. The intoxicating scent of the apples serves as a warning..........you are entering a restaurant like no other. This is my third Bouley (I'm not counting the early bakery days) with the level of excellence and creativity I've come to expect. The dining room is elegant and comfy. I love the fireplace with the fire blazing, or the stately library area. I always order the tasting menu. The chief uses seasonally fresh ingredients, and puts his unique spin on each dish. I could list and critique each plate, but why bother? All dishes but one were sublime. When the plates were cleared with food remained on them, we were asked if something was wrong? No one at the table cared for the ""Kobe Cheeks."" The wait staff immediately offered another dish..........We declined, as we were commenting not complaining. The waitstaff then gave us cheese plates, and all the desserts. You read that correctly, we sampled all the desserts............heaven! I left stuffed, it's been 24 hours and I still can't eat. But I can dream of my next time dining at Bouley....... Ask to sit in a corner...............",1

My standouts: The Farm Egg The Japanese Kobe Mille Feuille The Uni Terrine The wine selection - every glass was GREAT. I was so full by the time dessert came I felt I wasted the chocolate souffle. The service here is amazing and the ambience, cosy and intimate even though the table next to us was incredibly loud. It felt like we were dining in someone's living room. I'm definitely going to bring my Dad here when he comes to visit. It's up there with Daniel & Le Bernadin but with a less stuffy atmosphere. Noted that many people who were dining there were significantly older than us. The crowd was a mix of older folks and wall street diners. PS: Jacket required for men.",1
1493,490,2,12/14/2012,"To be frank, I just didn't like Bouley. There's no way to describe our waiter other than saying that he was a pretentious jerk. At a table of 10, he was rude to almost every single one of us at various points during our 4-hour, 6-course tasting menu. We chose to come here for a special occasion, but there are plenty of places in New York where we could have spent less than $3,000 and been treated with more respect. It was clear that he did not want to have anything to do to us. Upon asking questions about the menu, we were told to ""read it for [ourselves]."" Additional comments include, ""Ugh, so American,"" and, ""Have any of you ever even BEEN to Europe?"" The food was fancy, yes, and I'm sure many people do truly enjoy it, but there was nothing served that I am interested in going back to eat again. Even if someone else paid for the meal, it simply wasn't that good. I couldn't even drink my cocktail. I offered it to everyone at the table, but no one could stomach it. You would be far better off going to Del Posto, Gramercy Tavern, Dovetail, or any of the other fantastic restaurants in this city that serve food that is both upscale and delicious. The decor is over the top stuffy. I don't understand why you would use any artificial scents in a restaurant. Shouldn't the food provide the appropriate aroma? The carpets, the chairs, the place settings - everything is very old fashioned. I will say that the glassware/barware is beautiful and this has got to be the nicest bathroom in the city. The sommelier was lovely, kind and helpful, as was Robert who brings the bread cart. Sadly, that wasn't enough.",1

4501,490,5,12/4/2012,"When my parents come to visit, they want to dine at Michelin star restaurants. Upon entering, we were surrounded by floor to ceiling walls of fresh apples. The smell reminded me of a country cottage and the layout made quite an impression on me. While I liked the apple room, I was not impressed by the design of the interior of the restaurant. It looked like a castle - and not one of the charming ones either. Stuffy, with ugly paintings on the walls and an area that looks like an old library. The tasting menu is $175 (Steep! Even for NYC) and I let our server pick out my courses. I loved all of his recommendations and everybody at our table had only good things to say about their dishes. I highly recommend the Chatham Day Boat Lobster. I have never had a lobster so perfectly cooked. I loved that Bouley has a wide array of knowledgeable servers and each round of courses was presented by someone different. In fact, I don't think we had a main server, they worked as a fluid team. I dislike robotic, military-like precision some restaurants have when serving food. (I don't enjoy it as much and find it to be unsettling.) There was a good pace between courses and the friendly man who pushed around the expansive bread cart was always nearby. The bread cart is amazing! There must have been 9 different loaves we could choose from. My favorites were apricot, garlic and olive. I have been fortunate to dine at many upscale restaurants in NYC, but Bouley is one of my favorites. Although I don't care for the decor, what is important is the quality of the meal. Bouley balanced many complex flavors in every one of their dishes and the service was exceptional. 5 stars!",1

4503,490,5,11/18/2012,"Bring a suit is what I was told a few days before I arrived in NYC to meet my girlfriend. It was a birthday dinner for me, and while she wouldn't tell me where we were going, I was told it would require a suit and I'd enjoy it. She was, as much as it pains me to admit such things, completely right about both. I am, as many people who may be on Yelp or even reading about this restaurant may be, a bit of a foodie. I've had the chance to eat at some truly amazing restaurants in my limited time, be it Michelin 3-stars, or needing Michelin off-roads to get to (see what I did there). Bouley is, in my opinion, one of the very best. From the foyer lined with apples, to the cart and waitstaff dedicated exclusively to artisan made breads, the service, food, and atmosphere were all exceptional. Everything was cooked to perfection, and in typical French cuisine fashion. There was never an empty plate in front of us, be it a main course or complimentary Â amuse bouche from the chef. Atmosphere is definitely dressy, jacket required, and reservations are a must. It isn't a bargin basement meal, but without a doubt worth it for a special night or occasion.",1
4504,490,3,11/17/2012,"There are literally no two words that describe Bouley better than ""Cold pastoral!"" I'm kidding, just wanted to Keats drop. Bouley, Bouley, Bouley... Maybe it is my fault. Maybe my expectations were too high. My friend told me Bouley, EMP, and JG were his favorite restaurants, period. Having gone to the other two, I had to try Bouley. Maybe it is my fault. Where is Tribeca? How do you spell Tribeca? Why did we take the subway in the opposite direction and end up in Long Island? Maybe it is my fault. I don't wear suits for fun. I don't bring suits on vacation. I hauled a goddamn suit from Houston because jackets were required. I get a call the day before our reservation reminding me jackets are required. JACKETS WEREN'T REQUIRED (for that day only). So I'm looking like a dick because I have on walnut shoes, have no walnut belt, and went belt-less and jacket-less. Walk into Bouley and you go into a room with about 500,000 apples. It is amazing. Everything about the ambiance of Bouley is amazing. You literally step out of NYC, one of the hardest cities ever to feel calm, into a Poussin painting. Service is amazing. Is it? It might even be too amazing. I hated that EVERY UTENSIL: fork, other fork, spoon, other spoon, knife-- were removed and replaced with fresh ones after each of the five courses. DEFINITELY MY PROBLEM. I couldn't stand it. Food. Here we go. Three stars, for sure, son. Started off with a strawberry/cherry tomato that was the best appetizer/salad I've had in my life. I can probably think of five things that really made me think, ""Wow, I have never tasted anything like this in my life"" and this was one of them. Down hill from there. Some mushroom dish called Forager's something something something. A TON OF FOAM. A ton of mushrooms. Fatty tuna. Didn't care for it. Braised kobe beef cheeks was the worst choice. Too tender, mushy. Too rich. Tasted like something any college kid could cook in one of those slow cook machines. Desserts: underwhelming. So you get two gelato scoops on your dessert... and then two gelato scoops before that as your palate cleanser? C'mon, man! C'mon, Bouley! Ambiance: 5 stars Service: 5 stars Savory Food: 4 stars Dessert: 2 stars ASIAN COUPLE WITH THE SLR CAMERA AND TWO FOOT LENSE NEXT TO US: -3 stars",1
4505,490,1,11/15/2012,"We had a universally dismal dining experience here. A 20-minute wait to be seated without the least bit of explanation. Shuttled without apology to a basement room. Uncaring yet haughty service from a random parade of service people, non of whom (with the exception of a pleasant woman who offered us bread) Â expressed the least concern for us. In between courses of one forgettable dish after another, we were treated to an argument between two of the service people and no less than three requests to receive the bottle of wine we'd ordered. Â To cap it off, I'm still waiting nearly a year for a response to emails I sent to both the manager and Mr. Bouley expressing our disappointment. I'll say one thing for them: they're consistent.",1
4506,490,5,11/1/2012,"I LOVE this restaurant. Â In a summer filled with extravagant and over the top dining, Bouley was my clear favorite. Bouley's ambiance reminds you of a French Chateau - some might think it's cheesy, but I love it!",1
4507,490,5,10/28/2012,"Crazy good value!!! Best fancy restaurant in NYC for sure. Great decor, excellent, well- timed service and most importantly amazing tasting food. My favourite dishes here are the crab and porcini flan and the duck breast. Dont bother with the others, just go to Bouley!",1
4508,490,2,10/20/2012,"It just seems abusive to take advantage of a person with a stated vision problem to serve the most expensive wines (by the glass) on the list. Two glasses, at lunch, for $29 and $26. More fitting of a tourist trap than a fine restaurant.",1
4509,490,5,10/19/2012,"I went to Bouley this week for our Anniversary dinner. I have to say its the best dining experience I've ever had. I'm Â not just talking about the quality of food, but over all the service was great. We had three different people attending to us and yet it didn't seem crowded nor were they rushing us. We got there at 815 and left at 1115. We ordered 2 entrees and 2 appetizers. Since my husband told them its out anniversary we must've gotten at least 5 dishes complements of the chef! We thought that was really sweet. I really enjoyed the bread cart, the guy gave us bread give aways as well cos we enjoyed it so much. Overall, the ambience, quality of food and service is superb and if you want to celebrate a nice evening with your loved one this is the place to go.",1
4510,490,4,10/14/2012,Classiest food fight i've ever been to. They present you with surprise dishes. I had no idea what was going on but I left extremely satisfied. Food-nado. (tornado),1
4511,490,5,10/13/2012,"This is a top ten dining experience for me. Â  Everything was off the charts, the food, the ambiance, the service, the pace of the meal, the whole dinner was transcendent.

4512,490,5,10/7/2012,"My girlfriend and I went to Bouley for a Friday night dinner during her trip out and wow, it did not disappoint. We really had no idea what to expect going in besides the rave reviews from yelpers and the infamous 4 1/2 stars that it received. The second we stepped in the door, though, we knew that it was going to be a great night. We walked in, checked in for our reservations, and were seated right away. Just walking in to the main dining room was a sight to see: amazing art hung up on the walls, seating that wasn't crammed and uncomfortable (my girlfriend and I come from LA so this was extremely important to us), and, of course, the plethora of people dressed in business attire (prior to the reservations, the receptionist calls to ""remind"" you that it is business casual attire. I had never had this happen before but it definitely helps set the classy mood for the night). For starters, the chef welcomed us with a tomato puree with goat cheese and caviar. I was never a fan of tomatoes but mixed with the cheese and caviar, it tasted wonderful. The next welcome dish was a Japanese bread with the same cheese and caviar and that dish was absolutely phenomenal. It was a great start (it was also free, might I add). Now for stuff that we ordered. As an appetizer, we ordered a single plate of oysters. When the maitre d' came out with the dishes (yes, he brought out two orders), he explained that it was best enjoyed with a single plate per person and the second plate was on him (what?!). The lemon steamed oysters were alright, the lemon was a bit overbearing, but the chilled oyster that comes with it was amazing. For our entrees, my girlfriend ordered the day-boat lobster, which she enjoyed extremely, and I ordered the Penn Chicken with ravioli and mushrooms. The chef's decision to mix these three was pure awesomeness. I have never had a piece of chicken so tender and memorable (in a good way, I promise). Also, during our entree, a waiter came across with a cart of bread that Bouley makes themselves. There were about 10 flavors, but my girlfriend and I both decided to go with the French Garlic, and it was amazing. The garlic wasn't overbearing, but just right for an enjoyable side. Speaking of sides, the meal comes with two sides from the chef, mashed potatoes (soft, fluffy, diced green onions: all you can ask for in mashed potatoes), and a red cherry salad (this usually comes with nuts but because of my allergies, mine were without and it was still great). And now for dessert...the chef presented us with another two gifted dishes, a sorbet of lavender and chocolate, and a creme brulee in a peach puree. The sorbet Â was great, especially the mixture of the two, and the creme brulee was fantastic, though I think it could've done without the puree (whatever, it's free!). We ordered the chocolate souffle that came with a white coffee sorbet, the souffle itself, and a chocolate sorbet. The sorbets were great but the chocolate souffle itself was amazing. Crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. After, the chef presented us with yet another dessert, a trio of macaroons, chocolate wafers, and vanilla and chocolate cookies (when we asked to doggy bag them, we had already finished the macaroons, but the maitre d' was nice enough to give us another fresh batch to take home). As we left, the hostess gave us a bag of lemon cake to take home with us. Overall, yes Bouely is pricey, but the amount of food they give out of generosity tops the ending price by 10 fold (alright, that might've been an exaggeration). The food was fantastic, service was amazing (I forgot to mention, very exquisite introductions by the waiter for each dish), and the wine, which I also forgot to mention, was great. We are definitely coming back to Bouley again, and we won't be shocked at the business casual attire reminder next time we go!",1
4513,490,5,10/6/2012,"I have been going to Bouley several times a year for the past few years. Â I spent a year abroad in France many moons ago and this is the most authentic 5 star French Restaurant in the states that I have found to date . The portions are tiny and full of flavor. Â I like to say it's like a ""festival of flavors in your mouth!"" Â The lobster is to die for, literally like nothing you will ever have in your life. Even the strangest foods are absolutely delightful here.. Not to mention the absolutely impeccable decor. The stone on the floors was actually imported from Europe, that's how important detail is to the owner. Â . If you want to have a very special dining experience this is the place for you. Worth every penny.",1
4514,490,4,10/5/2012,"We had a good night. Four instead of five stars because we found the staff overattentive (an understandable risk in places like these where the waiting staff outnumbers the number of tables).

4515,490,5,10/2/2012,"Came here for lunch over the summer, but am just getting around to writing a review now. Â This is one of the best meals I have ever had, and at $55/person for five courses (plus several additional smaller courses not listed on the menu), it was actually a good deal price-wise. Â I had the organic LI duck, black cod, and Anjou pear tart, plus a chilled peach soup, an amazing cheese twist with dipping sauce, and a few other extra courses. Â Everything was fantastic. Â They take their time serving the meal, and their presentation is elaborate, so be prepared for a 3+ hour meal. Â I would definitely go here again.",1
4516,490,5,10/1/2012,"One of the best restaurant experiences I've been in. Â Amazing service and the food is just out of this world. Â I did the five course lunch and I left thinking about how it was such an amazing deal. Â I've made up my mind that every time I come to NYC, I'm going to eat at Bouley. Â The atmosphere is beautiful, relaxing, and completely impeccable. Â So was the service. Â I cannot describe how much I enjoyed the food. Â I recommend this place to anyone who loves amazingly made food. Â Just solid and heavenly.",1
4517,490,5,9/25/2012,I cannot say enough about this restaurant. The staff was so friendly and helpful. We both got the tasting menu with the wine pairings. Everything was exquisite and delicious. We felt like we were eating in a friend's cozy home. The whole meal was just a culinary experience from the moment we sat down. This is definitely one of the best restaurants in New York and a very special place.,1

4519,490,4,9/25/2012,A unique dining experience. Really enjoyed most of the dishes and all the seafood was especially good. The service is great and they go out of their way to make sure you are comfortable and full. We got 2-3 free dishes throughout the night.,1

4521,490,5,9/17/2012,"I have been living in New York for over 2 years and don't understand why I have only been to Bouley one time! Â My boyfriend and I love great food and wine, but after having a wonderful meal here, we were left wondering what took us so long to eat here. Â The food was outstanding, the service was great, and the decor took me to France. Â I usually only talk about food in my reviews because I don't think decor should affect my Yelp star ratings, but this restaurant was gorgeous. Â Anyway, the great thing about the 5 course taster is that you can pick whatever you want and when you have 4 people in your group, you can taste everything! Â We even swapped out a few courses out with other dishes on the menu for an additional price and had the chance to taste almost 3/4 of the entire menu. Â I would have to say my favorite dish was the Organic Long Island Duck Roasted With White Truffle Honey. It was cooked to perfection and had so much flavor!",1
4522,490,1,9/15/2012,"This is the worst dining experience that we have had in a while. When you go to a place priced like Bouley, you expect the best. This is clearly not what we got, not even close. The service was very poor and the maitre d was very simply rude and arrogant. We had a horrible table that was in the way of all waiters. Food was ok bt nothing spectacular really. Don't go there.",1
4523,490,5,9/15/2012,Use to work here! Â One of the best restaurants around. David Bouley is the man that can and will make it happen. Super expensive but well worth the money. Chef de Cuisine Brian Bistrong is at the helm now.,1
4524,490,5,9/14/2012,"Time to update this four year old review. Bouley is still our #1 restaurant, in New York and maybe in the world. Â We always have great meals. Â Our recent visit, to celebrate our anniversary, was absolutely perfect. In addition to the three courses we ordered we were provided 4-5 additional dishes and several sides with our entres. Â Little thrills like chanterelle mushrooms in an apricot and lavender sauce. Â Plus a couple extra desserts. Â For our actual meal we shared a perfect foie gras, then I had the best roast duck I've ever had. Â A generous serving, it was moist, tender, and so flavorful. Â For dessert we each went with the chocolate souffle. Â  For drinks, we started with Kir Royales, then a bottle of a nice white Bordeaux, and finally a heavy 1985 Toro Albala Don Px dessert wine to go with the chocolate dessert. Service was beyond impeccable. Â The setting is so beautiful, so romantic, so peaceful. Â It is formal, but it's also comfortable, with some great art works on the wall and fresh flowers on the tables.",1
4525,490,2,9/14/2012,"The service was pretty good overall, however the head waiter spoke to my husband about what I would be eating right in front of me and when I spoke up he ignored me and continued to say "" go ahead and pick what your wife would like since she can't do it herself."" He also seemed upset when only my husband ordered the wine tasting. A new waitress was working as well and he wasn't very nice to her throughout our dinner. She actually ended up being the most attentive and polite of the servers! Â  We ordered the chefs tasting and I was not too thrilled with the plate presentations I feel as though a lot more could have been done to make them look better. Don't let some of these pictures fool you they don't all look that nice! 3 out of the 4 of my pre dessert plates had black truffles as the main ingredient. I like black truffles, but when I order the tasting menu I would like to taste more than one ingredient! They could be a bit more creative! Â The wines were pretty well paired overall and the dessert was pretty good! For the amount of money we paid it was a let down :(",1
4526,490,5,9/9/2012,"I never really understood the big fuss people made over black truffles. Heck, I barely even liked mushrooms. That was before we dined at Bouley. My husband and I chose this romantic location to celebrate our 5th year wedding anniversary. We couldn't have been happier with our choice. In fact, we agreed that it was the best dining experience we've ever had - anywhere. We arrived right on time and were greeted and promptly seated. Not only is the restaurant graciously appointed, but the smell was divine. We were seated at a small table, but it didn't feel small. Also, because they placed vases of flowers between each table, we didn't feel like we were there with another party. We ordered cocktails and asked the sommelier to choose a white wine for us. He did a wonderful job capturing the taste we wanted with the discombobulated descriptions we gave him. Unfortunately, our wine came before our cocktails, but that was OK with us. (Incidentally, The La Pomme Â was wonderful.) The chef sent two complimentary starters - a chilled tomato culee with ricotta and black truffle oil. Yum. The second item was a cracker with a similar cheese and black truffle oil atop. Really yum. We opted for the chef's tasting menu and were not disappointed. Every course was as good or better that the previous. Some standouts: the mushroom plate, the salmon and the Kobe beef cheeks. The fig bread was a knockout. We could have eaten the whole bread cart. Hubby loved the garlic bread. We ordered the souffle for dessert. Â In addition, the house sent over a pear dessert with a hand written Happy Anniversary note. It was a very nice touch. They also sent over a tiered tray of petite fours. Another super nice touch. The sommelier happily wrote the name of the wine we ordered so we could choose it again. In total, the meal lasted about three hours and cost nearly seven hundred dollars, including tip, wine, cocktails, coffee. When we left, we were stuffed! They hostess handed us a nice parting gift - a lemon pound cake that made a nice breakfast the next day! Other than getting our wine before cocktails and waiting a bit too long to order, and having to ask to get the wine refilled once, the service was fantastic. I would definitely go here again. There did not appear to be any parking or outdoor seating. Due to construction scaffolding, we walked by the place twice before realizing where it was!",1
4527,490,4,9/9/2012,"Went with my husband for the 5-course lunch deal. Â It was a great bargain at $55 per person. Â It is also way more than 5 courses: amuse bouche, course 1, course 2, course 3, course 4, palette cleanser, course 5 (dessert), and a 3-tier tray of tiny petit fours. Â AND DID I MENTION THE BREAD CART. Â This lovely man comes round with at least 6 different kinds of freshly baked bread and helps your pair each one with your course. Â He'll bring you as much as you can eat. The food was impeccable. Â As a testament to its quality, I saw Anita Lo also eating lunch there. Â The service was delightful and the wine was excellent. Â I will absolutely be returning soon!",1
4528,490,2,9/9/2012,"Food tasted great but gave me poisoning. Thanks! They totally disregarded the one food allergy and the no-lactose request. Forgetful, scattered, disorganized, sometimes dismissive service. Â  I've never been to a place of this level that looked overstaffed and felt understaffed. Some dishes explained, others practically thrown on our table. The petit fours tray was literally dropped onto our table from a height! and the person who did so didn't even break stride, just dropped it without looking at us as he sped past. Â Ridiculous",1
4529,490,5,9/8/2012,Bouley is truly a paradise of great food and wine! Â The attention to detail on every dish is unfaltering and the service is just what you'd expect at an upscale restaurant.

4530,490,5,9/4/2012,"I literally just came back from a family dinner at Bouley- and even though I'm in a serious food coma, I feel a need to share my experience NOW. Â My mother had been talking about Bouley for a while now. Â She said she went a few times 15 years ago and all she could remember were the carts of fresh bread loaves and excellent food. Â With my father's birthday and parent's anniversary two days apart, we decided tonight was the night for a family dinner at NYC's finest- Bouley restaurant! Â  We knew we were getting ourselves into a classy affair- so we all dressed up in dresses, heels, and jackets for my father and brother. Â Might I say- we looked pretty damn good! Â The location shocked us all- it was located in a not so very pleasant part of Tribeca. Â For one of the most gorgeous restaurants I've ever seen- the location did not do it justice. Â We were first mesmerized by the foyer, where shelves and shelves of golden red apples laid. Â The dining room was absolutely stunning- it was elegant yet cozy. Â I felt as if I were apart New York's elite society. Â May I add that even the bathrooms were breathtaking. Â A smile immediately broke out on my face the second I entered this restaurant. My mother and I decided to order a drink (which was really a mistake). Â This is the kind of restaurant where you want to have a deep, rich glass of red wine- not a NY cocktail. Â Don't get me wrong, the cocktails were yummy. Â We were given two small loves of bread and smooth, creamy butter. Â The bread was amazing- but I could see the impatience in my mother's eyes- she was waiting for her beloved cart of bread loaves. Â Alas, the cart came our way. Â My oh my, how many breads to choose from! Â The Bread Master (LOLZ) was very knowledgable of his breads- there was the apricot walnut, the pistachio hazelnut, the country garlic, and oh so much more! Â Being a hazelnut and pistachio whore, I opted for a nice thick slice of that. Â Slathered with butter, I couldn't be more happy. The chef had sent out complimentary appetizers- a cold gazpacho-esque soup with a creamy glob of ricotta in the center, along with a flaky cracker topped with a creamy brie and caviar. Â Both were unbelievable! Â I decided to order the Porcini Flan (Alaska Live Dungeness Crab, Black Truffle Dashi) and the Organic Long Island Duck (Roasted Whole with Sisteron Lavender/Hudson Valley Organic Hand Milled Polenta, Local Currants). Â  The Porcini Flan was delicious with its chunks of fresh crab meat in a Truffle broth. Â The intensity of flavors was outstanding. Â My parents ordered a cheese platter with toasted breads. Â The Cheese Master (he is totally not called a Cheese Master) brought out a cart of HUGE CHEESES. Â I literally had been eyeing the cart throughout the entire dinner. Â Oh how I love cheese! Â We were all picking out the rich and creamy cheeses that we chose while literally moaning with pleasure. Â At this point, I was already full... we all were. Â  The waiters then brought us out our entrees (OR SO WE THOUGHT) and when we saw them our first thoughts were- YAY SMALL PORTIONS! Â I'M SO FULL! Â But no.... Bouley is so nice (too nice)- they gave us a complimentary tasting of a delicious piece of fish mixed with tangy heirloom tomatos. Â It was outstanding- but OMG we were FULL! Â  My brother had ordered the chicken- and before bringing out the entree, our waiter (who was the nicest, best waiter ever) had brought out the entire chicken in its pot to explain how the chicken is cooked. Â The presentation was lovely and he had even opened the top of the clear pot for us to whiff the amazing aromas of the chicken! My duck was EXCELLENT. Â I am always nervous to order duck- I feel like it's something that I enjoy, yet I haven't really enjoyed it anywhere. Â I ENJOYED THIS DUCK! Â All the flavors combined tasted like Thanksgiving. Â The currants were such a joyful little addition- ugh, heaven. Â As sides, they gave us a delicious side salad that was actually orgasmic and I even wish I could have it every day of my life PLUS the most amazing whipped mashed potatos on earth. Â At this point, my mother, father, brother and I were all leaning to the side and rubbing our stomachs- sighing and laughing. Â No one else in the restaurnt was acting the way we were. Â How was this possible? Â Were we doing something wrong? Â How could people not feel as stuffed as we felt? Â  Initially, we asked the hostess to bring a small birthday dessert out for my father- but we were hoping they would forget. Â If one more forkful of food entered our mouths- we'd have to be rushed to the emergency room. OBVIOUSLY, they brought out complimentary ice cream and a cookie platter. Â LIKE WHAT !? Â My father's birthday dessert was AMAZING- the flan was so tasty but here's the best part- MARZIPAN FLAVORED ICE CREAM. Â Do I even need to explain the EPICNESS of that? On our way out, my mother and I received goody bags of freshly baked loaves of cake- no words can describe their generosity. BOULEY IS PWNAGE ELITE.",1
4531,490,5,9/4/2012,"This was my favorite meal of my trip to NYC, and it might have spoiled me for all restaurants to come. Bouley offers a 5 course lunch for 55 dollars; and with all complements of the chef it really is more like 7 courses. The experience was like eating inside a beautiful tea cup, and I've never felt so elegant. Therefore, I have zero photos to show for it--but take my word it was the best. Beginning with an entire cart of fresh baked bread and ending with a 3 tiered desert tray--you will love it all! If you have to have a last meal on earth--have it here. @eatdrinkla",1
4532,490,4,8/31/2012,"Bouley is incredibly beautiful, but a little bit pretentious. It is every bit french: the sommelier, the host, the decor, the food. I found that the amuse bouches (tomato gazpacho, potato-cheese puree+black truffle on top of cracker), first round of breads (raisin roll and flax baguette), and the appetizers (porcini flan and seared toro+mushrooms) were absolutely delicious and fresh. I nitpick now relative to my experience living in Francophone countries - The kitchen lost my interest once we got to the main courses. We were given a black cod dish as a gift, which was perfectly cooked and also very nice of the chef, but the fish was underseasoned. Also, the food overall - including the main course breads and the sauces for all courses - was a touch too sweet. The main course bread crust is also very lacking. Things picked up again when we got to dessert. All in all, I think the restaurant is incredible. It would be a very small step to take it to perfection. Definitely recommended; the setting, food, and the service will blow anybody's mind.",1

3083,490,5,8/17/2012,"Bouley is one of the most beautiful restaurants in Manhattan. As told by our waiter, the interior decorations were all imported from France and took three years to complete. Their hard work was not in vain, once you step foot in Bouley's dining room you feel as if you've been transported to Europe. We had excellent service throughout the meal and after we told our waiter that we were there for an anniversary lunch, he whisked us up to the kitchen for a quick tour. While touring we met the man in the flesh, David Bouley, mulling over a tasting menu for his private dining room. The Chef was kind enough to greet us and conveyed some kind remarks regarding our special occasion. One thing I noticed about the kitchen was it's cleanliness and order. There was a calm, buzzing energy on the line which was focused, but not chaotic. Overall the food, service and atmosphere was an experience to remember. If you're into french fine dining, then Bouley should be on the top of your list of places to try.",1
4534,490,5,8/11/2012,"Bouley now ranks No.1 in my NYC restaurants list, very good food and service. I couldn't stop wondering during meal that why Bouley was only a one star restaurant. I would give Bouley an extra star if I were a Michelin inspector. Too bad I am not :D",1
4535,490,5,8/11/2012,"Visited Bouley twice in the past 2 weeks. Overall I think the food, service and atmosphere is certainly comparable to, if not better than, most of the many top tier restaurants I've been to in NY and around the world. Some of my absolute favs at Bouley is the pre-dessert white peach soup with icecream (I don't think they have this anymore), the porcini flan with crab, and the duck. The bread service is also extremely good. I've also had some of the more creative (El Bulli inspired) off menu items such as the white chocolate ""cloud"". On top of the food, the service was superb (I had Carlos on both visits) and the atmosphere is lovely. Most restaurants fail to impress the second time due to the loss of the surprise factor, but Bouley was superb on both visits. Will definitely go back again next time when I'm back in NY.",1
4536,490,5,8/8/2012,"A Sensual Feast in the Most Beautiful Restaurant in NYC! From the moment you enter Bouley, surrounded by the scent and site of apples and the beauty of the velvet walls, you know you are about to experience a special and memorable culinary experience. Last Friday, my friends and I were mesmerized by Chef Bouley's culinary magic. Â We chose the ultimate experience...David Bouley's Chef's choice tasting menu. Â The time flew by as we tasted at least 10 courses (I am embarrassed to admit, I lost count!) created by Chef Bouley for us. Â  SInce two of my guests were first timers at Bouley and two of us were regulars, David prepared signature tastings for his new guests and offered new creations for the rest of us. Â My new guests were discriminating colleagues from Finland and Rome. Â They had never experienced anything quite like Bouley. Â For them, David's signature Flan with Dungeness Crab and Black truffle dashi was a favorite. Â For me, I am still dreaming of the delicate duck he prepared in a bed of lavender from his Connecticut garden. My guests enjoyed duck with fresh cherries. Â We began our experience with a beautiful martini glass embracing chilled salmon bits with tomato and elderflower gelee. This course was followed by single slices of fresh strawberries and tomatoes from the chef's garden each one seasoned with different herbs and oil. Of course there is the famous bread cart. Next we had sliced fingerling potatoes pared with caviar. Â There were many more courses, including foie gras, scallops, lobster and more. I only wish I could do the descriptions justice. Â David is a master at marrying ingredients and flavors that sing in harmony. Â Each course was light, fresh and absolutely delicious. I wish I knew how to add photos! Â Each was accompanied by a wine paring suggested by Adrien, Bouley's award winning sommelier. Our service was perfect. Â The staff catered to our every wish. Â We felt like very treasured family and friends. It was a perfect evening that we will remember forever! Thank you Chef David Bouley!",1
4537,490,5,8/2/2012,"Truly amazing place, one of a kind! Â  Quick heads up, 5 course tasting lunch menu is an amazing deal for $55. Â However, only if you have 3-4 hours in the middle of your day can you truly enjoy the meal. Â By the 2nd hour, I was getting nervous about getting back to the office, I truly had no idea! Â  The service is really spot on. Â Each person is warm, friendly and willing to answer questions, let it be the gentleman running the bread cart to the waitress about the entrees or drink menu. Â In additional to the 5 course, we had extra appetizers and desserts, so it ended up a 10 course meal. Â  Each dish had its own unique taste and texture. Â I'm a simple person when it comes to food and typically quantity has a quality of its own. Â However, this is one of the few times where quality trumps quantity. Â  Started with the Carpaccio Of Kampachi, thinly sliced tuna, great! Porcini Flan, a dungeness crab and what I loved about it, it didn't just taste like crab, there was plenty of crab in the dish itself. Â The truffle flavoring was amazing! Organic Long Island Duck Roasted was my entree, moist and flavorful with the truffles, apparently I really like truffles! Closing statements: The artisan bread cart had a really nice assortment. Â Anything with walnuts and olives, nice! First thought was fancy French restaurant, probably need to pick up a hot dog on the way in... the dishes kept on coming and everything was well made and delicious. Â You really get your money's worth. Went there for a friend's special occasion. Â Definitely have to take the wife there. Â  I hear the lady's room is nice enough to take photos. Â Will let her explore!",1
4538,490,5,7/26/2012,"Went here and fell in love with food all over again :) We were two people and both had the tasting menu with wine pairings so I saw and tasted at least 12 different dishes (6 each plus amuse and an extra desert.) The amuse alone was amazing, a duo of tomato coulis with a soft cheese and raspberry vinegar - so incredibly fresh - alongside a yuzu flatbread with some kind of amazing soft cheese and truffle on it - amazing. The tasting menu was delicious as well, standouts were the uni terrine (unbelievably fresh and salty in flavor), the mushrooms with grilled toro and the fresh farm egg with comte but the list could easily include every single dish. When our deserts came out, they brought us both a small banana brulee and a pear tarte with a lemon meringue filling on top of the deserts that came with our menu which was a really nice touch despite the fact I could barely eat anymore :) The service was near perfect, the servers are attentive but not intrusive and clearly knowledgeable about the food. The sommelier was fantastic and the wine pairings were incredibly interesting (especially the most amazing pinot noir I got with my duck and cherry dish.) Yes its expensive but its a treat and one well worth it!",1
4539,490,5,7/23/2012,"Lunch for work. I had the tasting menu, excellent, excellent, excellent. Nearly everything was amazing. Service was top notch. Seafood done perfectly with rich and savory sauces.",1
4540,490,4,7/22/2012,Absolutely delicious ! Loved every bite I had. We were a bit nervous at first because we had heard mixed reviews. But when we sat down we were extremely excited. The staff was very helpful in explaining the dishes. The owner even came over and spoke to us. Â I loved every single bite I took. I would highly recommend this place. My boyfriend and I are here on vacation and next time we come back we will be coming here !,1
4541,490,5,7/20/2012,"Sometimes when you go for Michelin's lunch, it is not uncommon to say ""meh, that was a different thing from what I had in dinner"". But here, you are guaranteed to receive the best, no matter if you pay 50 for lunch or 200 for dinner. I really enjoyed the Sunday lunches. One more note. They have great tea to end with the dessert.",1
4542,490,3,7/19/2012,"I was here with a party of 10 we were split to 2 tables for lunch. Service is very proper, Â atmosphere is classy and upscale as one would expect. Unfortunately the food wasn't up to par. Â we ordered off the pre-fix menu, overall the food was bland and not exciting. The wine was amazing.",1
4543,490,5,7/8/2012,"This restaurant is special. I had a party of four and we were seated at a spacious round table. The wait staff is superb - friendly and professional. I can't say enough about how the staff enhanced the experience. They were wonderful. I was running late due to traffic, so I called to ask the staff to take care of my guests until I arrived. They seated my guests and took impeccable care of them until I arrived. They get 5 stars for being so nice. The food is great, the decor is fabulous. This restaurant is definitely on the list for a return visit.",1
4544,490,4,7/3/2012,"I have been to the old location a number of times, but this was my first visit to Bouley since it moved to Duane St. Â It is exactly what you would expect, and I think the NY Times review of the new location was spot on, with the exception of the criticism of the people answering the phone, who were perfectly lovely every time I called. The decor is opulent and over the top, but you kind of expect that at Bouley, and they make it work (well, maybe not the giant faux impressionist paintings). The service/hospitality was impeccable! The food was wonderful, but didn't wow for the most part. The value was excellent! Â We ordered 3 courses a la carte and still ended up with an 8-course dinner, with 2 amouse bouche, an additional free course sent out by the chef between appetizers and entrees, pre-dessert dessert, and post-dessert petit fours. Â There was the famous bread cart. Â And of course my husband got a complementary dessert for his birthday. Not sure what they serve for the $175 tasting menu (the old Bouley tasting was more in the neighborhood of $90), but personally don't think it's necessary or justifiable. The crowd is sophisticated and really fun to watch. Â Of course, we had the rough luck of being seated next to the one table of real housewives of some outer borough celebrating some anniversary in all their drunken glory, but that's just how it goes sometimes. Â The waitstaff miraculously managed to keep them contained for the most part, so even that didn't ruin our evening.",1
4545,490,5,6/30/2012,"It does not get any better than Bouley. The lunch, price fixed is the way to go. For a fraction of the dinner costs you can experience the the best NY has to offer. A 5 coarse extravaganza. Superb service tops it all off.",1
4546,490,5,6/24/2012,This is a pretty terrific place to spend an evening. And that apple-lined entry -- I think I could live in that room.,1
4547,490,4,6/21/2012,"The food is good, but the service is what makes this place great. Â Every step of the service is impeccable, all the way down to the mini lemon loaf cakes we were given to take home, and the cab that was hailed for us as we left. Â The food is perfectly lovely (the duck I had was tasty), but we visited other places where the food was more memorable. Â If I could give 3.75 stars, I would",1
4548,490,4,6/17/2012,"Beautiful restaurant with apples all over the waiting area. Very dreamy, even down to the basement. Food, however, fail to leave a significant enough memory for me to go back again -- maybe just happen not to be my favorite dishes.",1
4549,490,5,6/14/2012,"The most perfect dining experience I have ever had. From the food to the service to the atmosphere it was just beautiful. I took my boyfriend here for his graduation and they did everything to make it special. We naturally chose the tasting menu, accompanied by some delicious rose wine. They started us off with their bread selection which offer some of the most interesting types of breads. Pistachio being one of them which was wonderful. Every course (plus little extra surprise dishes) made my taste buds orgasm. I have never tasted food so amazing in my life. By the time dessert rolled around I was so full but kept pushing through like an Olympic champ because it would be blasphemy to leave anything on your plate there. As we were eating our chocolate souffles they brought us an extra dessert with ""congratulations"" written on the top of the plate in chocolate. SO NICE. I go downstairs to the bathroom, some gentleman, I suppose a manager of some sort asks me how my dining experience was and to send a congratulations to my boyfriend. This is a little embarrassing but I'll put it in anyway to just show how diligent their service is. The knifes were a very cool shape but a little confusing as to which way you cut. One of the courses (my mouth-watering duck to be precise) I was cutting the duck with the wrong side of the knife haha clearly having some trouble cutting and a waiter actually came over and very politely corrected me. They REALLY pay attention to you. Even though the restaurant was pretty full we felt as if we were the only ones there because that's how you're treated.",1
4550,490,4,6/14/2012,"Did the tasting menu: everything was immaculate and delicious. Â The bread selection, of which they continually offered additional slices, was fantastic. Â Also, they brought at least 4 additional courses free of charge. Â The service was great. Â Only thing that was less than perfect was the atmosphere--though the building is beautiful it has a slightly artificial feel to it (maybe because it was lunch rather than dinner). Â Price was also great: we received far more than the $55/person (before tax and tip) that we paid.",1
4551,490,5,6/13/2012,"An almost-perfect dining experience. The interiors are absolutely gorgeous, from the quirky waiting area with the wall of apples, to the warm and charming main dining area that, though small and intimate, utilized the space well to keep the area feeling open and not claustrophobic. The food is of course all around excellent, and I wouldn't do the menu justice by recommending anything in particular. Give the tasting menu a try though and you can't go wrong. It's of course a little bit pricer, but for the quality of the food and amazing, super-attentive service, you can't really complain. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the TriBeCa area.",1
4552,490,5,6/13/2012,"OMG! This place is AMAZING! I seriously had a foodgasm. Bouley was everything you could ever want from a restaurant. The place was beautiful, they had gorgeous decor and fresh flowers everywhere, the service was five stars. The food was the best food I ever had and they were so good at accommodating every single request (2 vegetarians in the group) I never had so much food in my life. I wish I can describe every single dish, but everything was in French, so who knows what I ate, I just know I could eat it everyday. Another thing, they have a guy with a bread cart that comes to your table and brings like 8 types of bread for you to choose from, that bread was so freaking delicious! I want his job! I want to be the magical bread lady that brings happiness to those arond me! Important tip: Go during lunch!!!! and have their 5 course sampler for $55. Dinner time is EXPENSIVE! I know that $55 is not what you would normaly spend on lunch, but believe me, it's a DEAL! Eventhough the meal was supposed to be 5 courses, they kept bringing food! I think they were in reality like 9 courses LOL.",1
4553,490,5,6/9/2012,"Our party of 6 arrived at Bouley for a late dinner - starting at 9PM. Â To be sure, we were all hungry by then, so it was good that service was relatively fast, unlike many of Bouley's counterparts. Â Our table took on the 6-course tasting challenge, of course! Since the menu is not available online, and I was quite tired by then, I'll use this review to give a general gist of what's to come if you go there since I can't remember the names of everything I got. I walked into Bouley thinking that I would not be impressed as I'm not typically a fan of French dinner food, but was I wrong. Â From the appetizer to the dessert, everything came out fresh, hot, and tasty. Â As with most French food, it was rich - but since portion sizes are not controlled by McDonald's - everything came out in just the right amounts. One item that I do remember was the valrhona chocolate souffle - every bite was as bittersweet and rich as the last - and it was by far one of my favorite desserts I've had in a while. Â  To complement the dishes, Bouley also has a great selection of artisan breads - from apricots, walnuts, pistachios, to plain old sourdough. Â I'd recommend the apricots and pistachios - two of my faves. We would have tried the cheese selection had it not been 1AM by the time we finished with dessert!",1
4554,490,5,6/6/2012,This is officially my favorite restaurant so far. Service was great and everything I tasted was bursting with divine favors ! It is a MUST TRY for foodies!!!!,1
4555,490,1,6/4/2012,"I just called to try to make reservations for a celebratory lunch for me, my new groom and our friends and family after our wedding that will be taking place at city hall and since we're expecting 11 people plus 2 toddlers and a baby, which is over their 8 person maximum for a regular table, I was told that we would need to reserve a private room for a $2,000 minimum. Â So instead of them serving 11 people the $55 tasing menu plus what I'm sure would be plenty of champagne and other alchohol which would have totaled around $1,000 they've completely lost my business. Â Is this because I mentioned there would be children there and they are prejudiced against kids or is it because they have so much business that they can turn away a $1,000 party on a weekday afternoon? Â I guess I'll never find out since I'll never go there.",1
4556,490,3,5/16/2012,"I am disappointed to have had a mediocre experience at Bouley on Mothers Day. First of all, make sure to request a room on the main floor. If you are seated in the basement, the service will suffer. Guaranteed. Furthermore, the atmosphere is much darker, danker, and mustier. And the chandeliers are embarrassing. The food itself was good, but I have enjoyed much better flavors here. My table was split on the tomato soup amuse bouche. My biggest disappointment was the duck, which I remember being absolutely sublime, but this time, smaller and simpler. The biggest problem I had was the service here. It was confused, with a waiter telling me outright ""this peach soup is a special that is not on the menu"" and I had to tell him it actually was on the menu. Plates were left on the table. Our wait between tastes was upwards of 25 minutes. Food was dropped on our plates with no description or explanation. It was not a Michelin experience. I would only return if I was guaranteed a seat on the main floor.",1
4557,490,4,5/14/2012,"I took my parents here for Mothers Day and was floored by how incredibly gorgeous the restaurant is. It was kinda girly with a lot of reds / pinks / flowers (are the flowers always there? must have been $300 of bouquets around the restaurant) but so so gorgeous with beautiful decor and furniture. I go to restaurants for the food, not the decor, and I normally couldn't care less if I was sitting on the dirt in a cave, but this place was spectacular. Perfect for mothers day or a romantic date. The food was great. I had the tuna appetizer which was the the smoothest tuna sashimi I have ever had. It literally melted in my mouth. Then I had the mushrooms ($15 supplement) with the toro. The combination was a little strange, but the mushrooms with truffle sauce were AMAZING. One of the best dishes I have ever had. I'm still drooling. Then I had the egg with cheese, with was overly cheesy. Was okay. The steak was okay (didn't compare to 11 madison), but I tried the duck which was awesome. The duck comes out pretty rare for those that don't like bright red meat. The apple/pear soup with ice cream didn't seem appetizing on the menu, but was delicious and refreshing and surprisingly really great. The chocolate souffle was really really really dark chocolately. And of course the amuse, the bread, the dessert gifts, and the service were great. A really great experience. I would love to come back, especially for the lunch prix fixe which is a steal. Saw another review about bad service - we had perfect service while there.",1
4558,490,5,5/8/2012,"Attn men: Jacket required and ladies: pick out the fancy dresses that are conservative yet sexy ;) I was nothing but impressed with the exceptional service that my friend and I received at Bouley. Â It was a very intimate setting with a phenominal wait staff who tended to all of our needs literally before we could even ask for anything. As far as the menu goes, the food that I ordered tasted wonderful. My only little gripe would be that everything that was offered on the menu is a typical dish that you would find at another high end French cuisine but, nonetheless, I was pleased with what I did have. Another thing I'd have to mention is that the entrance with the apples along with wall is a great touch to restaurant.",1
4559,490,4,5/5/2012,"We had the tasting menu lunch on May 5th. Â Lovely restaurant, excellent service, and the food was good. Minor complaints: Â  1. dining room was chilly. Â  2. 3 servings of ice cream were served in a row -- a lychee sherbet, a small serving of wheat flavored ice cream, then ice cream served with the ""main"" desert course of either chocolate or pear cake. Â I like ice cream but.... 3. weak ""coffee shop"" served -- undrinkable. Â Maybe the expresso is better.",1
4560,490,2,5/4/2012,"Really? Â Really?!? Â How do you blow someones engagement? I want to give a fair and honest review, so first, The Good: Â The food at Bouley is absolutely brilliant. Â If there was a font for the way British people say ""Brilliant!"" to make it sound more elegant I would use it, but alas, I'm working with Arial. Â What I'm saying is, the food really is outstanding: Â We had the a mushroom appetizer and the first bite i took may have been the best morsel of food I've ever had. Â Also, the beef cheek gnocchi was unreal. Â I've been fortunate enough to have a few work events at Per Se, Daniel, and Jean George and i think Bouley is number 2 in NYC strictly from a food standpoint (behind Per Se). Â Really Top Top Notch. Â So if you are a foodie and don't care too much about service, decor, etc, this is easily the best meal you will have for you dollar anywhere and you can stop reading the review here. Â Also, the female sommelier here was terrific. Â She was educated enough to take my vague preferences and make some terrific suggestions (while simultaneously giving me a lesson in wine regions) but humble enough to do so without making us feel like uneducated buffoons. Â First time thats ever happened in NYC. The Bad: Â I'm being a little nitpicky here, but for a top Michelin rated restaurant some people would expect a few improvements. Â The service was ok. Â  Nothing stood out and there were a few times we had to wait for wine to be poured or look around to get a server's attention. Â Not a huge deal for me, but some people expect an army of attendants for a $200 a head meal, so i figured i'd mention it. Â Also, the menus were old and had food stains on them - which was noteworthy since this is such a top notch place. Â Again, I don't care about that, but some ppl reading the review might. The Ugly: Â When I made my reservation they asked ""Is this a special occasion?"" Â I reflexively answered ""Um...well yes actually...I'll be proposing, but not in the restaurant"" Â I wasn't planning on saying anything, but i was asked, and hey, if it gets us a nicer table or some special treatment all the better. Â  Well, I couldn't notice any special treatment during the meal...until desert. Â The waitress brought us out a creme brulee with the word ""Congratulations!"" written on the top...which would have been nice...except for the fact that I HADN'T PROPOSED YET!!!. Â Really?!? Â I mean, isn't that one of those things you make absolutely sure of before doing?!?! Â Act like you've been there before, all the waitress had to do was look on my girlfriend's finger to see there was no ring there yet!!! Â UNBELIEVABLE. Â Totally amateur hour, and very disappointing for such a high end place. Â I don't know whose fault it was (the person who took down my reservation, the maitre d' that night, the waitress) - but any one of them could have used some basic hospitality 101 skills to recognize the delicacy of the situation and the importance of getting it correct. Â I told the maitre d' what happened and he said the pastry chef had a note that this was an engagement dinner. Â WHAT?!?! Who cares!?!? Â I obviously didn't pass him a note. Â I'm just telling you that someone screwed up MASSIVELY. Â You telling me the specifics of how you dropped the ball doesn't help my now completely ruined once-in-a-lifetime night. Â I'm not looking for a free meal guy (the bill was not reduced at all BTW), just a sincere apology and possibly someone else to share the look of complete shock and embarrassment I just had at the table. Â Grade: F. BOTTOM LINE: Â If you want one of the tastiest meals in your life, come to Bouley. Â If you are looking for a first class dining ""experience"" (service, ambiance, etc), you may want to look elsewhere. Â And if you are planning on having a surprise party for your wife there, expect to be greeted at the door with ""Welcome to Bouley, all your guests are hiding in the back waiting to jump out and surprise you when you walk into the dining room...right this way please""",1
4561,490,3,4/29/2012,"Place is nicely decorated which is perfect for a special occasion. Service was ok, it wasn't outstanding considering the price. Ordered the a la carte menu and I had the crab appetizer & oysters which were outstanding. For the main course I ordered the Long Island duck and my husband had the lamb. Duck was good and it was a nicely sized portion. On the other hand the lamb that my husband received was not good at all. In the beginning the waiter brought it out prior to putting it in the oven to show how it would be cooked,thus we had high expectations.When the meal came out it was very undercooked, and once we notified the assistant waiter, he attempted to reassure us that its supposed to be like that. We got the head waiter and Â sent the plate back and got cod instead. Waiter came back and confirmed that it was ""severely"" undercooked, yet did not offer to comp anything. It took 10 mins to prepare the fish dish and my husband ended up eating it by himself, since I was done with my duck, not wanting for it to get cold. Â Bread cart was great, wine list was good, and deserts were ok. Â I still prefer, restaurant Daniel, which is similar in food and price, but has much better service.",1
4562,490,5,4/28/2012,"Hands down, the BEST dining experience I have had since moving to Manhattan. I came here with two female friends for my grande 23rd birthday, and I could not have asked for anything better! I should have known it was a recipe for perfection the moment we walked through the door & there were rows of crisp apples adorning the entryway walls. Our reservations were for 9:30pm on a Friday; we arrived shortly afterward & were seated in the waiting area, where we had our first exposure to the plush interior that is Bouley. I ordered a lychee prosecco martini while waiting & was convinced that I could die happy in that very moment. Our table was ready around 10:15pm or so (you really lose track of time when you're so cozy) & we were escorted through the main dining room, to the downstairs seating area. Being the youngest diners there by a solid 3 decades, we initially thought they were just trying to hide us in a basement corner (there were only 2 other tables filled downstairs). Regardless, we sat down on the scarlet velvet loveseat & I was back in heaven. We started off with a complementary tomato (?)-based soup that put anything from Campbell's to shame, as well as two rosemary artisan rolls (100% worth giving a shout out to). The three of us then decided to share the Porcini Flan, given all of its rave reviews, and this is where the most wonderful dining experience in the world truly began. As the other tables downstairs left, it was the three of us ladies with about 5 of our own personal wait staff. Instead of 1 Porcini Flan, they gave us three perfectly-sized portions so that each of us could mindlessly indulge. Oh, did I indulge. For my main course, I opted for a glass of Pouilly-Fume & the Chatham codfish with shiitake mushrooms, toasted fava beans & ginger aromatic sauce. Perhaps the most delicate and flavorful cod that has ever graced my lips. As a complementary side, the wait staff brought the three of us a plate of creamy mashed fingerling potatoes topped with chives. At this point, we were questioning whether we were just getting some supreme service, or if this was the norm. We proceeded on to the refresher course, a lychee sorbet, and decided to split the Hot Valrhona Chocolate Souffle for dessert. Here's the part where I decided to quickly use the ladies' room (also very plush inside)...and returned back to five desserts. Yes, five. I'm pretty sure we were the most entertaining diners there, plus the only ones in the basement, so I just pictured all of the wait staff in the corner saying, ""let's bring them out 5 desserts and see what they do"" and giggling together. So yes, the Hot Caramelized Anjou Pear, the Creme Brulee, the Hot Valrhona Chocolate Souffle, the complementary birthday dessert with an incredible rose sorbet, and the three tiers of petit fours were all delightful. David Bouley had successfully impregnated me with a food baby. It's as if he had just seduced the three of us on our respective scarlet plush loveseats for three hours (we left at 1:15am). I was convinced I now resembled the Michelin man. I was never leaving that loveseat. Unfortunately, the time finally came & we headed back through the apple-scented entryway. But wait...don't forget your complementary tea cakes, ladies! Bouley, if you are reading this, I am single. Call me.",1

Â They were like crack, I had to stop myself from stuffing myself. Each course was impeccably prepared and delicious! Â The porcini flan with crab and truffle was pure heaven.

Happy, light hearted wait staff, knowledgeable, courteous, very gracious and not stuffy in the slightest. We had the tasting menu which was incredibly well priced for what it was -and coupled that with the wines to match. The sommelier came around each time a new wine was served, with a new interesting story of the wine region and makers. It really added an extra element to the meal. The food was fine fine fine! I won't go in to everything b/c I'll be here forever but just know that if you have a really special occasion to celebrate or just want to splurge, go to Bouley. Their dinner menu might be slightly different so check it out. We were there for four hours and didn't want to leave. The best dining experience I've ever had -we even got a little tour of the kitchen after our meal.

Â My eight year old expressed it as ""Surprise"" each time. Â They really enjoyed the different assortment of breads and especially the chocolate soufflÃ©. Â We were able to get the Chef to sign the menu as a keepsake of our experience. Â ""WoW!""",1
4568,490,5,4/13/2012,"First off, I have been to many restaurants in Manhattan, but not have yet to ""WOW"" me enough make an account to write a yelp review. Bouley is the first one to actually make me want to write a review. Overall hands down the best meal I've had dining out. Usually whenever I go out for lunches or dinners, I like maybe one dish and partial components on a few dishes. I usually leave each restaurant a little disappointed. I realized by being in the food industry myself, my expectations for the dining experience have risen exponentially. Bouley currently is the only one yet that has met and exceeded my expectation. Today I went for lunch with two friends. I suggested we go to Bouley, since I remember have a pleasant experience two years ago. When you first enter the restaurant, Â the crisp aroma of fresh McIntosh apples greet Â you. The decor was wonderful as I remember, comfortable yet elegant, with a hint of warmth. The waiter and Â maitre'd Â were very pleasant, funny and attentive without being evasive. My favorite part of architecture would definitely be the basement where the wine cellar and restrooms are, the long stretched hallway , was like being in a castle. it is a very classic old world feel to it. So since there was three of us, we decided to do the lunch tasting menu, we had a lot to eat, I couldn't remember everything, but I will list my personal favorites and dishes I thought were interesting. -Kuzu Cracker (amuse-bouche, I use Kuzu all the time as a thickener, but using it in to a cracker was very interesting, I forgot what the spread on it was but it was really yummy) -Carpaccio of Kamachi, Tuna (Ridiculously fresh) Wild Mushroom (Stole a bite off my friend, rich and earthy, for those who like mushrooms you'll love it) -Asparagus with two types of cheeses (also stolen bite, was very delicious) -Porcini Flan, Alaska Live Dungeness Crab and Black Truffle (absolutely divine) -Organic Long Island Duck Roasted (love duck, it was cooked perfectly, skin nicely crispy and sauce was perfect) -Pennsylvania Chicken( stolen bite again, was silky and juice, very well prepared, and cooked to perfection) Uni with Apple Foam and Salmon Roe (amuse-bouche, worked very well together) -Matcha ""Air"" (complimentary, was very interesting and refreshing) -Prune Amaretto(?) Ice Cream (from Chocolate plate, i thought it was hydrated cherries, wonderful surprise) -Mini Hazelnut Dacquoise (from Chocolate plate, very well balanced, delectable) -Meyer Lemon Tart (was very refreshing) The desserts were nice but not memorable. We also had petit fours and a lemon tea pound cake as a take home, which was a nice touch. We definitely left happy. Â The price may seem pricey when you first look at it, but well worth it. I would highly recommend lunch tasting menu, it was very well thought out and each dish was well balanced. Â Hats off to you and your staff, Chef Bouley.",1
4569,490,4,4/12/2012,"Bouley caught me off guard. Â There is an indulgent quality to the setting - which is more formal than I was expecting (clearly deserving of event dining). Â I was simply there for the foie gras - and to enjoy food with my wife. Â We were started with a tomato dish with a dab of ricotta and truffle oil. Â The extensive wine list led me to a Prager Gruner Veltliner. Â In the process of ordering the foie gras, I asked about a sauternes. Â The sommelier recommended a Mosel to save my palate. Â Brilliant - with a sweet front, soft back. Â The foie gras was brilliant and the portion was beyond decadent. Â The Gruner paired nicely with a simple duck preparation and whipped fingerling potatoes. Â The lemon tart dessert was good but not memorable. Â The coffee choices were too extensive. Â I want the best coffee a restaurant has to offer - not a selection. Â The specialty Intelligentsia only kept me awake that night.",1
4570,490,5,4/11/2012,"Awesome food, awesome service! Â just Â a wonderful elegant place to enjoy a fine dining experience. Â What more can be said? Â Deserves all the accolades and rave reviews it receives. Â Everything is great, a ""Can't Miss"".",1
4571,490,2,4/9/2012,"2.5 Stars. I truly do not get it and I must disagree with the overwhelming 5 star reviews on here. Came to Bouley for lunch with a few freinds some time ago, and I must say, although the service and atmosphere were solid, the food was just not impressive. In fact, I was so underwhelmed, I hardly remember much of what I had. Such a shame.",1
4572,490,5,4/7/2012,"Go for lunch, and have your wallet sigh with relief at the price of the tasting menu. Eat 5 courses, have a few more courses courtesy of Bouley, smile, leave a generous tip, and have a lemon pound cake gifted to you for tea. (That is, if you can fit in any more food.) Order a bottle of wine, or a glass for the sober, if you feel that you have a threshold beyond which you should not be ripping off the restaurant.",1
4573,490,5,4/3/2012,"This place is, hands-down, 5 Stars, because this is the best food I've eaten in NY and the price is a steal. Considering the quality and taste of the food, and the quantity given for the tasting menu, the ambiance of the entire restaurant, and the service received, it is definitely worth every penny. I came here on a weekday for lunch with my husband. Â We came pretty early, around 11 AM and the restaurant had just opened so not too many customers yet, but by the time we were finished with our meal it was pretty crowded. We both ordered from the luncheon tasting menu, which was a 4 course meal with a palette cleanser in the middle. Each dish came beautifully presented and the items delicately arranged on the plate with the unique sauces. Â When I bite into the food, the flavors literally exploded on my taste buds that left me thinking ""Wow, how can any food taste this good?! Why hadn't I came here sooner??!!"" Â There were so many different layers of flavor in each bite, yet they all complimented the others and one could taste the freshness of the ingredients. Â  My favorites are: Carpaccio of Kamachi, young Blue Fin Tina and Striped Amber Jack Porcini Flan, Alaska Live Dungeness Crab and Black Truffle Dashi Wild Alaskan Salmon Warm Smoked to Order with Bergamot Lemon Honey Tangerine Soup, Sansho Pepper, Lychee Sorbet with Crystallized Honey They give you an free course in the beginning, and free cookie tray at the end. They even give you a free pound cake when you leave! Â There are definitely enough food to get full on, unlike some French restaurants that give you so little amount of food that you'll have to go somewhere else to eat afterwards. Â Everyone, from the Hostess to the Waiters, to the Matre'D are incredibly courteous. Â The service reflects the type of high class restaurant that it is (They will pull your chair out and push it in for you to sit, fold your napkins when you leave for the restroom,...etc.) Â And don't forget to check out the restroom! It is downstairs through a long corridor that resembles walking inside a castle. Â The ladies room has different colored rooms as stalls, and the chairs are lined with velvet (check out the pictures I've uploaded). We left feeling amazed at the wonderful meal that we've just had. I can't wait for another chance to go back there again!",1
4574,490,5,3/31/2012,"This is one of my favorite restaurants IN THE WORLD. I first came when the restaurant was located a few blocks from their current location (and when they used to have the Bouley Bakery across the street), but I like their new location just as much (I think I like the down stair area the most). I always have a suburb meal and great time. The service is excellent and the decor just perfect - so inviting and so elegant. Update- made a reservation to go again and found out that for lunch the down stair area is only open during the weekend.",1
4575,490,5,3/26/2012,"Ok this review is late because the first draft was x-rated, so here's a second try. I've been dining at Bouley for about 8 yrs and it's always been in my top 5 until last Thursday night's dinner. The amuse bouche of ""Cold Tomato and Cherry sorbet soup"" was like Spring flowing over my tongue, nice way to start the meal, followed be ""The Connecticut Farm Egg"", can you say delish w/hints of garlic in the light foam which the egg floated in was like looking at a sunrise above the clouds and melted in my mouth like morning dew. Now you may need to lay down for the next dish ""Porcini Flan w/Dungeness crab"" (can you say party in your mouth) the way all of the flavors melded together light yet rich & heavy at the same time, then the surprise dish of the evening ""Baby Scallops, poached Langoustines in a Foie Gras sauce"" well all I can say is tingle in my pants, each scallop burst in my mouth with a sweetness like never before and the sauce was so fine that I used the bread I had to clean the plate (sorry Emily Post, I was ashamed). Now it's time for the main course ""The Duck"" oohhhh the duck, my heart is racing just thinking about it, cooked to perfection the crisp skin the moist, juicy, tender, succulent, tasty flesh (hold on I need a moment) (ok I'm done now) and then dessert, I kept it simple and laid down the law and only had the tangerine soup but my friend had the chocolate soufflÃ© which filled the air with the smell of perfection. I'm not a smoker but my friend who I was with and I now know what it feels like to need a cigarette, because as soon as we got outside he sure did and lit right up and leaned against the side of the building, and took a moment. Now when asked about where to eat in NYC I'll say Bouley and then there's the other 5. I look forward to my next visit. As for the service, I've was a restaurant manager for 27 years and would have killed for this staff...PERFECTION is all I can say.",1
4576,490,5,3/22/2012,"5 stars on the food + 5 stars on the service. I have no qualms about that. My man and I were there for lunch and our server Syed deserves the award for server of the year at Bouley. He was extremely attentive, friendly, and yet professional. We chatted and when he found out we were from Chicago, he must have told the kitchen about it because lo and behold, we received 3 complimentary courses in addition to our 5-course tasting menu for lunch. Man, were we stuffed but the food was excellently executed and delicate that we were extremely grateful for Bouley's generosity. Sometimes when going for a multiple course meal, not every dish might be executed as well as the others but it wasn't the case during our experience at Bouley. Syed also saw that we had our camera with us and suggested that he help us take a picture, once before lunch and once again after lunch. For the shot before lunch, he was trying to help us get the perfect shot from the perfect angle. When the kitchen staff arrived at the table with our amuse bouche, Syed told the kitchen staff ""Hold on, I'm trying to take a picture"", and to which the kitchen staff just stood there while holding our plates and waiting for Syed to perfect his photographic shot of my husband and I. It was quite hilarious especially when the kitchen staff joked about Syed, ""He thinks he's a good photographer but he's not"". We ordered wine and the French sommelier (yes, with an authentic French accent) was extremely helpful in articulating the wine recommendations based on our preference for the types of wines. I was deciding between the French Chardonnay and German Riesling and finally decided on the Chardonnay but the sommelier still very kindly let me taste the Riesling when he brought out my Chardonnay. Come April 2012, it will mark Syed's 10-year employment at Bouley. I think this is a reflection of Bouley as a very well-run place since in the service industry, it is very common to have a high turn over rate of staff. As we got up from our table, Syed even walked us out to the entrance and told us about the ancient ceiling and door fixtures used at Bouley. The very old wooden door leading to the dining room was brought in from Paris, we were told. Bouley is deserving of it's 1 Michelin Star that's for sure. Their 5-course lunch menu for $55 (weekdays + weekends) is a very good deal that no one should miss!",1
4577,490,5,3/22/2012,"too stuffy. service has slipped in comfort, risen in pretension. prices at an all time high. i liked the old ""red room"" decor better when it was across the street.

4581,490,5,3/9/2012,"One of the most romantic places in NYC. Â The apple filled entrance sets the tone as soon as you walk in. Â The space was elegant, but still cozy and intimate. The bread basket has a whole new meaning here. Â It's actually a cart of more than eight varieties of baked goodness. Â Blackberry rye, olive foccacia, French miche were just a few of the flavors. The actual dinner was delish. Â The foraged mushrooms were expensive, but worth it. The earthy flavors of the wild fungi were just sexy, especially with truffle foam and toro tuna slices. The rack of lamb was cooked in a big pot sealed with bread. Â It just gave off sorts of sensual aromas when the server brought it out to show me. Â  Looking for a deal closer? Â The chocolate frivolous dessert is a cocoa lovers orgy. Â Chocolate creme brulee, Several ice creams, hazelnut dacquoise and mini molten chocolate cake... Â Yes yes yes!",1

Great place for a special occasion, or if simply want to be reminded of what excellent food and fantastic service are like. I highly recommend this place and can't wait until my next meal at Bouley!",1

We waited ages for the food and the couple next to us waited even longer. Â In the middle of the meal we were told that our waiter had been fired! Â I felt like they didn't take us seriously because we were a young couple, but they need to realize that our money is just as good as everybody elses! Â The food was pretty good, but the experience was terrible.",1
4585,490,3,2/21/2012,"BOULEY ????? A very well done, small old world style, Nouvelle French restaurant with incredible service; including a Merci or Madame/Monsieur from the courteous staff. A very intimate atmosphere; perfect for a romantic dinner. Â Groups seem to be a little out of place here. Â The ambiance is calm, peaceful and without noise from other patrons to drown out your own equally quiet conversation. Dinner is approximately $200 per person including tax and tip. Food selection is roughly 70% seafood including, lobster, scallops, shrimp, and sea bass. Additional items on the menu were Colorado lamb chops and Long Island duck. A wonderful carefully selected ""by the glass"" wine selection as well as full bottles. Unfortunately, this entire wonderful ambiance seemed to take some what of a back seat from the menu and execution of dishes. Â The menu seemed ambiguous and somewhat deceptive from what actually came out of the kitchen. Examples of what was on the menu are the Sea Bass with ""a lot of vegetables"", as the waiter said, were actually a small minute amount of cooked vegetables that were hardly noticeable under a large piece of the rich tasting fish. Â The Long Island roast duck was actually a large portion of sliced duck breast but prepared well. Â No mention of ""breast"" only was ever mentioned. Fingerling potatoes were actually mashed potatoes. Â No mention was ever made that the potatoes came mashed. Â The classic chocolate soufflÃ©, which usually comes in some sort of ramekin, came on a flat plate that looked like a curved dog turd. Speaking of desserts, we had several different items from the menu including a couple of ""give away's"". Â We found all the desserts to be overly sweet. An additional disappointment was that the ""pour"" on the wine, was not consistent from glass to glass. Â It was a notable difference. Â And, at about $28 per glass, I would have expected it to be ""spot on"". With so many unexpected differences, I left feeling that I would probably not return evens though the portions were abundant and the food ""good"" but NOT ""outstanding"".",1
4586,490,5,2/20/2012,"I came here for a private wine dinner, so did not order from the menu...but, wow, the food was incredible! Beautifully presented, delicious, fresh, unique. There was a lobster starter with lobster rom a variety of places served with a light cream sauce that had a hint of vanilla in it. Wow. That was the starter and everything that came after was just as amazing. Wild mushrooms with steak tartare...the best I have ever had...Squab, delightful, tender, sweet served with pine tree needles, cherries and chestnuts...rack of lamb with a zucchini mint puree and a whipped potato with some kind of creamy cheese that was so perfect...followed by a cheese course and topped off with a pineapple souffle with a molten pistachio core. Wow. One of the best meals I have had. David came out to speak and was warm and modest. The service was exemplary. Â This place is very special.",1
1884,490,5,2/17/2012,"JACKET REQUIRED. This place is NOT cheap! Bill for two people came out to be near $300. BUT, I still give it 5 stars, not cuz I'm bougie like all my friends proclaim, but because they really hook you up. I made reservations (you should DEF make reservations). We went on a Thursday night and the place was packed. Â  We started with a complimentary pumpkin soup. It was so good... I ordered the Organic Colorado Rack of Lamb soubise of cippolini, zucchini mini puree black truffle sauce. Portions might be small for a guy, but it was more than enough for me. My friend got the Organic Long Island Duck Roasted with white truffle honey puree of organic dates and white turnip and the Organic Connect Cut Farm Egg organic date puree, red onion confit, pinot noir. He enjoyed both :) We ordered a peach dessert and a chocolate souffle (I wish they had a menu online so I can write the proper names :/). OMG. And the free stuff just kept rolling in: - red wine ice cream, - complimentary something creme brulee - complimentary 3-tiers of cookies. I wish they told us of all the free food they were going to stuff us with. But then again, we probably wouldn't have gotten anything if we didn't order dessert. After our fatty meals, a man gave me a goodie bag. Inside was a complimentary loaf of bread (it was sweet and light). It was definitely romantic, prim and proper, and abundant. I'd love to come here again :)",1
4587,490,5,2/17/2012,"Came for the $55 luncheon. It was fantastic! Every single dish was perfectly prepared. Get the Porcini flan with crab, truffle, and dashi.

4588,490,5,2/12/2012,"Bouley was *fantastic.* The service was incredible. The food was superb. There were many, many culinary options, including monthly specials and evening specials, beyond the packed ""normal"" menu. I had pappardelle pasta with veal for my appetizer. The serving size was generous for an appetizer. Before it arrived, the servers brought us portobello ravioli, which was delectable. The food arrival was perfectly timed -- not too fast, not too slow. For my entree, I had a seafood medley type of dish, which included lobster tail, shrimp and scallops. Everything was seasoned to perfection and tenderly cooked. Finally, for dessert, I ordered a hazelnut, pistachio, carmel panino, which was incredible. I was extremely full prior to dessert, but couldn't resist the perfect preparation. My only complaint -- if I had to give a downside to this restaurant -- would be the homogenous patrons. Everyone in the restaurant was very, very similar, and some of the conversations overheard around me were comical the way they were stereotypical, including discussions of ""daddy's yacht club,"" ""the country club,"" and disgust over the improper use of a butte knife ""goodness gracious, can you believe she did that?!"" But, besides a few people portraying an over-the-top stereotype, the restaurant was absolutely amazing from beginning to end.",1
4589,490,5,2/8/2012,"As I first step foot through the doors, unsure of what to expect, the scent of apples and wood heightened my excitement for what was to come through the next set of doors. I'm from the oc/la and came to visit ny for my anniversary. I really wanted to go to Chief's Table in brooklyn, but from all the raving reviews and the limited 18-seats, we were unable to get a reservation. Anyway, the food was delightful. Lunch ends at 3 but they still sat us down being we were late. My bf and I decided on the tasting menu, both with some variety of foods. Collectively, nothing screamed out at me, but the asparagus and cheese and the kobe braised beef were notable. I'm not sure if they gave everyone a pre-appetizer and extra desserts, but I loved it! Creme brulee on the house? my favourite. Also the coffee was fantastic, really compliments the entree and prepares you for dessert, plus i've never seen raw sugar cubes. By the end of our meal, we were so stuffed that we couldn't put a dent in all the sweets; cookies, creme brulee, chocolate souffle, peach thing, chocolate treats, and more! I almost forgot to mention the service, impeccable, very gentle if i could describe it. Our lunch was very intimate and romantic, (even though we were trying to take pictures while they weren't looking, total tourist/instagr.am junkies). I highly recommend this place for reasons being lunch is only $55 (thats a steal!!), it is so intimate, and perfect for a girls get together, business meeting, or even an anniversary. p.s. jackets are required, my bf didn't have a jacket, so they let him borrow one. :D",1
4590,490,5,2/7/2012,"Of all the top restaurants we visited in NYC I was most at home at Bouley. From their perfectly decorated and situated dining room, to the formal yet friendly and informative service everything went perfect while we were there. Â On top of that their 5 course lunch was only around $50. Their menu changes often so again I won't go into all the dishes but none of them were disappointments or even average. With that said I have to mention the Black Truffle Dashi. Â The flavors of ocean, truffle, and cream made for a perfect dish on a cool afternoon. Ending the meal you get a tower of different petifores which pushed me over the fullness meter especially for lunch. On the way out we received a full lemon loaf which was also great. I did end up wearing a jacket even for lunch, but I don't think everyone in the restaurant did. If back in NYC again this will again be my first stop for another memorable meal from beginning to end.",1
2753,490,5,2/6/2012,"It has been a while, but I'm glad to be back. Â  The warm scent of apples welcoming you as you step in to the warm room, the ornate waiting room decorated with orchids, and ah... the food. Having been here and had a wonderful experience last time, I decided to try some new items and let the chef pick my tasting dishes this time. Â That made for an exceptionally fun experience where each dish was a surprise, from the asparagus and cheese dish (I didn't know you can make asparagus taste so delightful), the crab and porcilini mushroom soup (hands down all time favorite), the beef cheeks (tender, flavorful, but not too heavy), and even though not a real course, the lychee sorbet was heavenly, and so was the wine sorbet. Â The desserts themselves I was less impressed by - I didn't feel that the flavor of apple and chocolate blended as well as it could have, and the souffle didn't have the moist texture I love without being held in a cup. Â But had they stopped after the sorbets, I would've thought it was a complete and wonderful meal as is, so I decided the actual desserts were just ""icing on the cake"". So I have to mention the bread, and the very nice gentleman serving them. Â They have several types of bread offered besides the initial mini-baguette and apple bread (apricot, walnut saffron, garlic, raisin and something, black olive, sour dough, fig...) adorable displayed in what I call a ""bread cage"" and served - we decided to try one of each and split each piece so we don't completely fill up on bread - and will highly recommend the apricot, saffron, garlic and fig. Service was superb, and made the experience even better. (superb = fantastic, attentive service without being stuffy, and with the added bonus of some sense of humor and a genuine smile) Look forward to my next experience here, and thank you for yet another amazing meal.",1
3126,490,5,2/4/2012,"How is it possible that a meal can make one feel so complete, satisfied and happy? Â What magic does an orchestra of the chefs and the wait staff serve you on Bouley's fine, ivy china? How can a meal be so exhilarating and yet so calming? Â As all these existential-level questions are burgeoning in my mind, I am finding myself at a loss for words... Bouley was something special and I can't put my finger on it, I just want to have it all again... Bouley is not food, it is not about eating, it is about having an experience - of being comforted and taken care of, of tasting the exquisite and drinking the sublime. The place: I was enamored with the fragrance of the apple filled lobby, the coveted cheese chariot, the ambiance of the cozy, old-fashioned dinning room that makes you feel like you are having a dinner in a manor on the estate that has been in your family for generations... if you ever were lucky enough to be born into such a family. The service: The service was fantastic: I loved the incredibly professional, yet utterly human and friendly wait team, the approachable and polite sommelier and the delightful Mr. Le Pain, who offered the most interesting cassis bread to complement our foie gras. Â Oh god, I sound like such an elitist! Moving on... The food: We went a la carte, 'cause the first two of the five tasting menu items would kill my dear husband (being shellfish and all; my husband was taking care of the bill, so an untimely death was really out of the question; (Je t'aime et merci beaucoup, Mon Cheri!) and, in my personal opinion, subs are never quite as mind blowing) so a la carte it was... The Blue Fin Tuna - perfect presentation: the tiny flowers, the fava beans, the sprouts, all arranged in an elegant wreath around the slices of the blue fin sashimi. Â Study this masterpiece before consuming, burn it into your retinas, it is a modern day Vermeer (sans the yellow) and it deserves to be remembered. The Foie Gras - well, they kinda beat Antibes' fois gras, which to this day has been my paradigm of all things foie gras (yes, I am THAT poor, my best foie gras costs $12). ""So, foie gras?"" - you say, judgmentally raising your eyebrow. Unethical? Absolutely! Delicious? I am sorry, was that rhetorical? Â  Personal note on the appetizers: Â Mnsr. Bouley, please add a bit more variety to the appetizer menu for those poor souls who can't do shellfish! Then, there were the entrÃ©es: Â the lobster, my tasty, perfect lobster and the delicious cod: Â both subtly flavorful and impeccably prepared. Â I think this was the point at which I resigned myself to the fact that I just capitally cheated on Jean Georges, and... I was ok with that. Â Yes, even Daniel was fine, but utterly perfunctory, like bad sex with a guy you don't really care about that much anyway (never happened btw)... but this - this was meant to be - Bouley and I were meant to be, I love you, David (in a metaphorical and 100% platonic foodie way). Â  I'll give everyone a moment, to compose themselves after that emotional scene... Ok, I've been raving (moping?) about my dinner and I can see your attention drifting, so I am gong to keep this real short. Basically, amuse bouche was cute, desserts were awesome, wine was excellent, service, yet again, superb. Â I love this place! Â It made me so happy, I literally slept like a baby through the night, I don't think a restaurant has ever made me feel this way before. I expected it to be overpriced, underwhelming, stuffy... but it really wasn't any of those things. In the way of epilogue I'll say: a $500 a la carte dinner for two with wine by the glass will not seem like the most rational way to go, if like me, you belong to the 99%. Â But the only other place I've tried food like this was in a little-known provincial town called Paris. And you know what? - a trip to Bouley is cheaper than a trip to France! So just go!",1
4591,490,4,2/1/2012,"Strange how the entrance floor dining area was so different from the basement dining area. Â Was this a hate crime since I was seated in the basement with other asians? Â (I keeed). Food prep, service and taste were impressive. Â Quiet and private where the overall experience was great however; the atmosphere was a little strange..(still can't get over it.. lol) Nevertheless, I recommend this place I'm a fan!",1
4592,490,4,1/28/2012,"Came here for lunch. Â Very good classical french cooking - heavy food, generally. Â Great service, very attentive and helpful. Â Good decor and ambiance. Â We were all quite full afterwards.",1
4593,490,1,1/17/2012,"I don't even know where to start with this place. I had a horrible experience here. I should have paid attention to all the warning signs: no real website, no readily available menu, or maybe the four $$$$ signs on Yelp. In retrospect, everything was telling me to stay away. Unfortunately, I wasn't using the brain I was given and immediately booked a table for two at Bouley for me and my girlfriend's anniversary. I thought this would be the finest dining experience we had ever...experienced.. And a memorable one at that. Well, I was right, it was certainly memorable, but for all the wrong reasons. Our reservation was at 8 PM on a Wednesday. As we enter, we immediately notice that there is nobody under 50 in this restaurant (Another warning sign). It is incredibly quiet. The awkwardness immediately sets in. My muscles tense up. My hearing suddenly becomes more acute. My stomach starts to knot. This is definitely not the place I want to be taking my date. I thought it was going to be romantic and intimate. Not stuffy with a strong scent of arrogance. We are seated. We are greeted first by perhaps another waiter. He places in front of us the wine list. Wait, wine book. We peruse the book for a minute or two, decide on the Tattinger Rose, and close the book. It had to be at least another five minutes before that man came back with menus...and left us again. For your info, our table wasn't very big. The wine list however, was. So I had no real place to put it at the moment, and just kinda let it teeter on the edge of our table as we proceeded to glance over our menus. Another five minutes later, our waiter for the night, a very tall and slender man from Bangladesh, glides over to our table. He introduces himself, welcomes us to Bouley, and then glides away. We resume our menu studies. We were pretty certain we wanted to try the tasting menu, and went through picking out our individual dishes. During our browsing, another waiter came over with two plates in his hands. I forget what it was, but I think it was some sort of butternut squash soup. ""Just to taste."" It was delicious, but I had a hard time juggling the menu, the wine book, and my spoon as I tried to feed myself. Â  At what must have been 8:30, we are finally greeted by the sommelier. We review our choice with him, and he swings off with our wine book...and we wait some more. Our real waiter comes back, and finally, we get to order. Do note that the first course of the tasting menu is all raw seafood, save the mushrooms. You choose between oysters or sea urchin, neither of which appeal to me. We were both going to go with the mushrooms, but our waiter strongly suggested that I try the oysters--and I strongly replied that I cannot stomach raw oysters. He's not having it however, and I wind up getting the oysters in an effort to actually start our friggin meal. Our first course arrives, and I nervously pick up my spoon, telling myself that it is ok to try new things. Things that I've already tried. Things that I've hated. I down one oyster and immediately regret it. I try my girlfriend's mushrooms which are ok. I feared for the rest of our meal. Next I think was the porcini flan with dungeness crab. It was superb. It made me relax a little bit. It gave me hope. My girlfriend had the lobster which was also great. Now, I completely understand that when you are having a tasting menu that you shouldn't want and wouldn't want to be rushed through your meal. However, we were waiting for an unusually long amount of time between plates. It also didn't help that they brought us almost every other plate on the menu that we did not order... ""Just to taste."" At what must have been 10 or 10:15, we got what were, thank god, our last savory courses. I had the lamb, and she had the kobe beef cheeks. They were fantastic. At one point we ran out of water, and I had to say something to get some more. Appalling. Two more extra courses later and we are finally on dessert. We are always won over by chocolate, and Bouley's souffles were no exception. While the food was ""???"" permeated by moments of spiritual enlightenment, the service was horrendous for a restaurant of such a high caliber. We were literally the last to leave Bouley at 11:00 that night, and we exited with haste so I couldn't think twice about the $500 in cash that I just tucked into a little rosewood box. Wait what? How much? Oh yeah, FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. Thanks for the heads up, Yelpers. And to top it all off, as if this whole ""experience"" wasn't bad enough, we spent the later half of our night running to the bathroom because we had managed to have just the right amount of luck to get FOOD POISONING. She was throwing up, and I was about to crap my brains out. You haven't lived until you know what $500 looks like at the bottom of your toilet. What they should have drizzled in chocolate on our plates was ""Happy Anniversary, SUCKERS."" Never coming back here again.",1
4594,490,5,1/5/2012,"What a way to kick off our first meal in NYC! Dropped off in the hotel's 7-series BMW town car, walked in to a lovely lounge, and then ushered into a stunningly ornate dining room to begin our lunch. Â  The dining room is lushly appointed and done so tastefully that the lavishness is appropriate and sets the scene for the amazing food that was soon to follow. Â The service matched the room: attentive, informative, friendly, and charming. From the head server, to the 'bread bringer,' to the sommelier, everyone was great! Jim G. and I went with the Luncheon Tasting Menu; sit down for a second to read this: all this amazing food, in this dining room, governed by the Michelin Star so rightfully earned by the chef, was only $55!!! In Manhattan, a 5 course (not counting amuses and petit fours) Michelin star meal was only $55. Â Honestly, Bouley has to be one of the best values (that doesn't feel like a value) in the city! Even after being so full, you'll be sent home with a wonderful lemon loaf cake! Spoiled me from beginning to end =) The menu changes, so there's no point in highlighting every dish we had, but there are two I must point out, in case they're on a menu when you go (then you must order them): -Porcini Flan with Alaska Live Dungeness Crab and Black Truffle Dashi: To die for. Wonderful combination and depth of flavors: earthy, creamy, oceanesque. Â  -Slow Braised Kobe Style Beef Cheeks: Tender, succulent, rich. Yum! Honestly, everything we ate was wonderful. Â Even with limited meals in NYC, I will return here when we go back. I must qualify that, while in NYC, Jim G. and I ate at 3 restaurants that had 3 Michelin stars as well as Bouley with its 1 star; Bouley was my 2nd favorite meal overall (nothing can top Eleven Madison Park for me). Do yourself a favor and go!",1
4595,490,2,12/31/2011,"It's been almost two years since I've been here, but I came across the place while tolling around yelp looking for something new to try. Given the really high marks this place gets, I feel the need to put my two cents in to say that I honestly have no recollection of the food. My only memories are of how stiff the wait staff were, how difficult it was to get information out of the sommelier, and a general sense that we could always ""feel"" the staff around us. I've been to my share of Michelin-starred places, so don't think it's that. Certainly no one was rude (far from it), but this restaurant can only relate to one type of diner.",1
4596,490,3,12/29/2011,"Typically for birthdays, my family will go to one of the top rated restaurants in the city. For my dad's birthday last month, we went to Bouley. Overall, we were all very dissapointed in the restaurant. For the price you pay, this restaurant is VERY overrated. There are some obvious bright spots such as the dÃ©cor. It is a pretty amazing setting for a restaurant and almost feels like you are somewhere in France. The service was ok- not even comparable to some of the top restaurants in the city. And the food was just ok. Nothing stood out, and my main dish of duck...I've had better duck at 1/2 the price. For the high ratings and the price you pay, my family and I expected a lot more.",1
4597,490,5,12/13/2011,"Amazing food and service. I loved sitting downstairs in the pink room, it seemed much more relaxed than upstairs. Â The food was fantastic and our waiter was very attentive. Â Loved it here.",1
4598,490,5,11/27/2011,"My wife and I both had the lunch tasting menu. Â A quick comment on those who are wondering what to order. Â I had the asparagus, porcini flan, long island duck, and carmelized anjou pear. Â My wife had the carpaccio, black cod, kobe style beef cheeks and chocolate souffle. We agreed that based on what we had, the best combination would have been the carpaccio, black cod, long island duck, and souffle. The 5 stars I've given tells the entire story. Â Bouley is amazing. Â My wife called it the best meal she's ever had. Â The decor was welcoming. Â It wasn't overly stuffy. Â The food was fantastic. Â And the service was absolutely unbelievable. Â  It is true and true one of the best dining experiences that I've had and one which I highly recommend to others; particularly for lunch where the price is simply a steal.",1
4599,490,5,11/24/2011,"Decor: ornate, tasteful, warm and regal. Â Our waiter said it took 2.5 years to build because the furniture was shipped from France. Â Of all the places in NYC, this is the most beautifully decorated restaurant. Â The modern, sleek, contemporary look is usually my style, but Bouley does it so tastefully without being excessive that it makes it my favorite restaurant in the decor category. The other categories fair very well also. Service: attentive, helpful but not intrusive. Â The staff is so friendly. Â Several people happily taking pictures for us inside and outside the restaurant, striking up random conversations. Â We had several servers for our table, so nothing to complain about service. Â They were warm and personable, joking around with us a little. Â We asked one server about the restaurant's different dining rooms and we ended up getting a tour of the restaurant, kitchen(!!) and got to see Chef Bouley working (!!!!). Food: AMAZING. We did the tasting menu and were so full. Â But still managed to almost finish the extra dessert on the house because we were celebrating our anniversary. Â  It was a wonderful anniversary lunch.",1
4600,490,5,11/13/2011,"I really don't think my review can do this restaurant justice, but it would be a shame not to write about Bouley after the amazing anniversary dinner we had here. Greeted by the scent of fresh apples and a French-accented hostess, we had to wait almost half an hour to get seated, but the dinner more than made up for it. When our names were finally called, we were seated side by side on a regal-looking sofa overlooking the entire extravagantly decorated space with its candle-lit gold-vaulted ceilings, flower arrangements, and giant paintings of the French country side. It was definitely one of the most romantic and impressive dining experiences I haved had, perhaps only rivaled by the Modern. I loved how two servers put down plate after plate of masterpieces on our table at the exact same time, one from the left and one from the right. We had the tasting menu, which still provided some choices, so we picked different dishes and got a nice sampling of almost everything on the menu. The drinks we tried (La Fleur and L'Ananas) did not quite measure up to the food, which was just stunning. Our favorites were the farm egg (!), the porcini flan, the scallops, the oysters, and the duck (basically, almost everything), all of which both looked and tasted like perfection. The short ribs and the sea bass paled a bit in comparison to the other dishes, although I'm sure they would have tasted great any other day. By the time dessert came around, we were so full already, but the chocolate souffle and caramelized pear were too tantalizing, and we ended up almost finishing everything. Was it expensive? Yes. But was it worth it? Definitely. We left thoroughly satisfied and with a ""goodie bag"" consiting of loaves of walnut bread and corn bread as well as an assortment of macarons and chocolates, which we munched on the next day while reminiscing about our meal. A+ Â  Â  Â  P.S. Keep in mind that the restaurant upholds a strict dress code. While we waited, a guy was initially turned down because he wasn't wearing a jacket, although the hostess disappeared behind a curtain and came back with one for him to borrow (apparently it was too tight, though, so his party left).",1
4601,490,5,10/30/2011,"I LOVED everything about it. From the food to the ambiance to the people, this place is now one of my favorite restaurants in the US. After eating at per-se and the French Laundry, the food at Bouley is at par or superior to either. Add the pleasant ambiance, reasonable price and friendly staff, and this is THE restaurant to which I would go back from the three. We had the tasting menu that offers quite a bit of selection. Our server picked up quickly on each of our individual tastes from our questions and his recommendations were spot on. Starting with a wide selection of breads, each tastier than the next, we were in for a treat. Bouley has a knowledgeable sommelier that keeps the wine list superb and interesting. When the staff realized our group is comprised of ""foodies"", they added several off the menu courses for us. One of which, the venison with gnocchi, was simply phenomenal. We are all looking for another excuse to going back there again",1
4602,490,5,10/24/2011,"A completely decadent lunch at a very reasonable price. Staff are attentive but not intrusive. Â The interior was ornately French. Â It was regal, but not unapproachable, the bookshelves created a warm, almost homey atmosphere. Â Be sure to check out the wine room below. Â The bathrooms are so incredibly seductive. Â  Seating: Try to get a booth seat, somehow we were seated towards the stairway leading to the bathrooms, which provided us the most privacy from the other diners, loved. Â  The food is well executed and presented. Â My favorites were the delicately seasoned bibb salad, the black cod was completely earthy with the buckwheat & ginger, the beans from Chef Bouley's garden so tender and the mini gnocchi with expertly braised beef cheeks. Â  Delicious meal and really well rounded experience. Â  $55pp tasting menu + $55pp wine pairing.",1
4603,490,5,10/23/2011,"I went to visit my friend in NYC and she and her husband took me to this spot. Â  She had mentioned it was the best prix fixe lunch... and yes, it really was. Â It's not really in a bustling part of town... and you can barely tell by the outside. Â But when you walk in... there are tons of apples which give this awesome smell. Â The waiting area is gorgeous.. but even more impressive is the dining room. Â Really nice... I love all the furniture and the decor. Â Now.. if you are picky, and prefer having cell phone reception, you can request for the dining room upstairs. Â We were shown to the dining room downstairs.. which is equally as nice. Â Red walls, lovely decor, quieter... Â This would be a fantastic place to take a date... but maybe for something special. Â It's not cheap.. but well worth it for $55 for a 5 course meal. Â You can of course order a la carte but it's not as worthwhile I think. Â It's an experience.. so you have to plan to be there for a few hours. Food was wonderful. Â Truth.. there are some things that are better than others of course.. the guide for all this is below. Amuse bouche Â was sorbet with various fruits on top of a cherry reduction. Â It was complimentary. Â It was good.. not mind blowingly awesome.. but good. Carpaccio of Kampachi, Young Big Eye Tuna and Striped Amber Jack Prepared in a Mediterranean Manner - This was an awesome dish! Â If you like raw fish.. you will love the fattyness of the fish, the sauces, and the vegetables on the plate that compliment the fish. Porcini Flan, Alaska Live Dungeness Crab Black Truffle Dash - This was truly amazing dish. Â The flan was delicious.. there was a lot of crab meat. Â Soooo good. Â I would highly recommend this. Â  Black Cod Marinated with Pistachio Miso, Organic Buckwheat, Ginger Aromatic Sauce and Skate - These are the other two alternatives you could have ordered. Â The skate was probably my least favorite. Â THe black cod was good but not as good as the flan with crab. Slow Braised Kobe Style Beef Cheeks with Ricotta Gnocchi, Blue Kale - A pretty good dish as well.. tender and delicious. Â I wasn't so impressed with the gnocchi. Â But the meat was good. Organic Long Island Duck Roasted with White Truffle Honey PurÃ©e of Organic Dates and White Turnip - This is an alternative to the kobe style beef cheeks. Â I didn't think it would be that good but it was pretty tender and awesome. Â Highly recommend it. Black sea bass with tomatoes - This is another alternative to the kobe style beef cheeks and duck.. not that great. Â It was okay.. I would recommend skipping. California Organic Orange Flesh Melon Soup Fresh Ricotta Sorbet - The melon soup was good but the ricotta sorbet was a little too rich for me. Dessert - We ordered all three of them. Â The cheese is not that good.. we had only ordered pasteurized cheeses because my friend can't eat them right now. Â There was only one cheese that was good. Â The chocolate molten cake was good.. the pear was just okay. Â It also comes with a bunch of complimentary desserts. Â None that impressed me that much except the tiny macaroons.",1
4604,490,5,10/22/2011,Bouley did not dissapoint! Very warm atmosphere. We did the tasting menu and were blown away by the dishes. Definitely try the porcine flan with truffles (my favorite). Got too full at the end to appreciate the dessert. Would definitely come back again.,1
4605,490,5,10/12/2011,"Bouley was an overall excellent experience. Booking the table was easy, and we were given 2 calls to remind us of the reservation. Decor was classic with some modern flare. The inside was impeccably clean. The wait staff was completely professional making you feel comfortable while also whisking away plates and placing settings at the exact right times without interrupting the flow of the table conversation. The star of the night was the food. We started with bluefin tuna sashimi as well as the foie gras. I will caveat that we are both lactose intolerant therefore some of the preparations were different from what is typically on the menu. The foie gras was lightly seared and paired with a semi-sweet fruit puree which when combined with the saltiness of the foie gras worked perfectly. However my happiness reached record levels when I was brought my entree, the duck. Duck is hard to do right...ive had a lot of bad duck in my life. Most places tend to cover gaminess by preparing duck breast scallopini style with a heavy sauce. This was hands down the best duck ive ever had. It didn't even need any of the truffle honey it came with, or the asparagus. The truffle honey was interesting and was sweet without being overly so, it went very well with the duck. The food was paired very well with a wine that the sommelier recommended. It's not cheap, but with food and service of this level, it's money well spent.",1
4606,490,1,10/3/2011,"Tsk, Tsk, Tsk, I went to Bouley last Saturday night with great expectations of having a wonderful dining experience in one of Manhattan's most fashionable well respected French restaurants, only to leave there irate and frustrated. I am a highly successful sales director for a very prestigious jewelry salon on Madison Avenue and frequently entertain high net worth individuals and Fortune 500 captains of industry from all over the globe. I usually take them to the my favorite haunts La Grenouille and Le Cirque, however I thought I would like to venture to other parts of town to offer my clients a different dining experience. I decided to dine at Â Bouley with some girlfriends before I brought one of my clients. I made a reservation three weeks in advance, and was very much looking forward to enjoying a fine meal in a beautiful environment in the company of good friends. We arrived at the designated time of our reservation to be greeted quite professionally by the front of the house staff, and were told our table would be ready shortly. They asked if we might wish to order cocktails while we waited, and I said we were happy to order a cocktail and I impressed upon them we were also happy to wait to be seated at a good table. Â A few Â moments after passing along this remark to the Maitre'd(?) three glasses of Champagne were delivered to us courtesy of the house. At this point I thought what precipitated the sudden but lovely Champagne offerings? A moment later my suspicions were confirmed when the waitstaff told us our table was ready and to follow them. We were waltzed through the glorious main dining room, all the way to the back of the restaurant, whereupon we took a slight right turn and were promptly ushered down the staircase into the bowels of Bouleys basement to a dark heavy room draped in cut red velvet! At this point, being a seasoned business woman who has experienced this type of discrimination before I kindly took my seat and decided that I would not request another table as it was already too late for Bouley to make amends, and I would write a letter to both the general manager of Bouley and copy Mr. Bouley himself. I will not continue to express my continued disgruntlement of the evening, but do want to make it aware to any BUSINESSWOMAN that might consider Bouley as a viable place to entertain important clients, BEWARE! DO NOT GO TO BOULEY!! Apparently the management at Bouley are completely out of touch with the fact that women in this day and age are equally as successful, influential and powerful as our male counterparts and sometimes even more so as we are the most important decision makers when it comes to where and how we spend our $$$$. So Bouley was a big fat BUST and failed miserably in the equal rights department. I cannot believe that a restaurant of this caliber continues to engage in this type of social profiling against single women patrons who are not in the company of a male companion. Shame on you Bouley, and BTW, your downstairs ""Red Room"" is decorated in Bordello!!",1
4607,490,5,9/29/2011,"What can I say, Bouley was amazing! Took my wife here for the first time for her birthday and had a wonderful experience. Not sure they do this all the time, but while dining we were given a free amuse bouche and then a free extra desert, and as we left a free apricot pound cake in a gift bag. The host and hostess couldn't have been nicer or the service any better. We arrived on a beautiful block in Tribeca, with limos parked outside and everything very pristine especially for NY. Upon entering the restaurant the foyer was completely covered with apples on shelves. I found this incredibly strange, but charming, rustic and different which I like. The host greeted us warmly but professionally and brought us through the main dining room, past a lot of old people, then down a windy stone staircase to a kind of fancy Louis the XIV dungeon room where there were a lot of young people. I guess Bouley wants the young people neither seen nor heard, which I found hilarious. But the room was very nice and we were seated on a red velvet couch type chair for two infront of a decorative fireplace. Very romantic and had the lay of the land so to speak. It was as if we were the king and queen of Bouley for relatively young persons surveying our royal court. Two spoiled little brats hidden from the main dining room's view. HA! Fabulous. The head waiter was a very unassuming man, very humble and kind, who knew everything about the restaurant and was a pleasant conversationalist. He immediately put us at ease and answered any questions we had about the food or surroundings. I felt like we were being taken care of by a sweet uncle or an out of work Lawyer! Everything was coordinated. When a plate was taken from my side it was taken from my wife's side at the same time. Synchronized waiting! It was amazing and very well choreographed. The food was excellent and like I said they brought over so much free desert I felt like I was going to burst. On top of what we ordered for desert they brought a 4 layered tray with all sorts of wonderful cookies, cakes and assorted goodies that were absolutely delicious. It was wonderful. When we left we were warmly sent off with a gift bag of apricot pound cake that was even better than the deserts we had been served. I would not hesitate to go back to this special restaurant!",1
4608,490,5,9/23/2011,"Went here last year on Christmas Eve Eve (December 23rd) for a special dinner with some friends. What can I say. I was very impressed. From the warm greeting in the well-appointed lobby to the delicious complimentary pastries for dessert, everything was perfect. We were seated in the sublevel of the restaurant which proved to be a great retreat, away from the busier (and loud) upstairs dining room. The sublevel dining room reminded me of a 16th century French monastery. It was beautiful. The wait staff was knowledgeable and very friendly. The food was incredible. I had the duck that evening (which is my go to menu item at French restaurants) and it was cooked perfectly and very flavorful. It was a year ago, so I am forgetting some of the other things we ordered but I remember leaving without a single complaint.",1
3328,490,5,9/20/2011,"Yes. Expensive -- nay, very expensive -- but yes. I did the tasting menu (on someone else's dime, ha), and oh man, so glad I did. Two reasons: a) everything was amazing and b) if I had stuck with ordering just an entree, I would have left Bouley very, very, very hungry. But remember point a): Everything was amazing. I honestly cannot remember everything I had, but you know what? I don't want to ruin it for you. Pick whatever you want from the tasting menu, and you will not be disappointed. I do remember two things, though: foam and scallop. There was almond-flavored foam on my plate at one point, and it was odd but yummy. And the one scallop I had was the best scallop I have ever eaten in my life. The next day, when people asked me about my dinner at Bouley, I raved about the scallop. Raved like a madwoman. The service struck me as a little strange, but probably only because I am not used to being waited on like a VIP. Everyone's plates are set down on the table at the exact same time (I found this amusing)! I am not classy enough for this place. It's an experience.",1
4609,490,4,9/16/2011,"Bouley is a top notch experience from start to finish. When you walk through the foyer, welcomed by the aroma of hundreds of fresh apples, and take your first look at the gorgeous dining room you know that you are in for a treat! Food - At this point I've had almost every item on the menu (I've only been here for lunch though so the dinner menu may have things I've missed) and have yet to find anything I didn't enjoy. Â Regardless of whether it sounds good or not get the porcini flan with crab - you won't regret it!

4611,490,5,9/2/2011,"Being a virgin yelper, I needed to find the perfect ""one"" to write my first review on - thank you Bouley. The entire experience was impeccable. I went here with my husband for our anniversary, which was mentioned on the phone at the time of the reservation. Walking in, we were graciously greeted by a woman with a French accent and the scene quickly changed from the streets of Manhattan to a romantic restaurant in Paris. We were seated on a beautiful couch, and were given a Bouley postcard with a Happy Anniversary wish on it. Since it was a special night, we decided to treat ourselves to the Tasting Menu. At $175 pp it was undoubtedly expensive, but well worth it. Plus, you are given quite a few options, which many other tasting menus do not. The food was amazing and the service was outstanding. I would highly recommend the Organic Connecticut Farm Egg, which I believe is also available as an a la carte appetizer. It sounds like such a simple thing, an egg, but it is orgasmic. Each course was delicious; appealing to the taste buds as well as the eyes. For dessert, we were given the chocolate souffle with a Happy Anniversary message written on the plate in chocolate. The decor is beautiful and the food is great. Definitely a must do for a special occasion. I couldn't leave this restaurant without taking a peek at the bathroom, which was decked out in red velvet and cushioned seats. Bouley, it was a wonderful night in Paris. Thank you for the escape and for being my #1.",1
4612,490,5,8/26/2011,"Possibly the best meal I've experienced in NYC, and one of the bext anywhere for that matter. Every course was superlative. I went here with 2 other people and we shared each dish that came out with one another. Nothing was bad. We stuck with the specials that evening as they sounded amazing (an Octopus apetizer, Â seared foie gras, lamb chops) What your ordering sounds like typical French fare, but it's quite exotic to the taste. A definite don't miss is dessert- stunning and delicious. As a former pastry chef this is what I am typically most critical of, I had zero criticisms. The presentation from the plating to the decor to the service is impecable. The prices are extravagant, but absolutely worth every cent. A very special place, if I can ever gather the fund I'm definitely going back.",1
4613,490,5,8/20/2011,"I very highly recommend it for the lunch tasting menu. If you go for dinner it will be significantly more expensive (as some review testify...). For $55 you have a 5-course menu, with 4 options for each course. I had Roasted green asparagus in a comte cloud Miso cod in a ginger broth with organic buckwheat Steamed seabass Ricotta sorbet in a fresh melon soup Hot Valhrona souffle for dessert. They also present you amazing amuse bouche to start and petits fours to end. The petits fours feel like another full dessert because there are so many of them. The service was fantastic. Most of the staff is French. It was my boyfriend's birthday and they made him a cake (free). You really feel like you are experiencing a very luxurious moment. Very very enjoyable!",1
4614,490,4,8/16/2011,"Bouley is one of my favorite restaurants. The interior designing of the place is cozy and intimate. It's really good for a date and it's nice for small get together. The servers are really nice and their accents just make you love the place even more. Your water cup is never really left unattended, they have the best service I've ever experienced. Every time I've gone, I've ordered something different. Their spinach salad with bacon crumbles is great - my favorite. Also, any dish that has fish in it is always delicious - the contrasts between their choice in fish and sauces are always satisfying. As far as soups go, their French Onion is a must and I've also tried their Watercress soup, it's pureed watercress. I would recommend trying any of their specials announced at the beginning of the meal - you'll never regret it. For dessert, their Creme Brulee is to die for - especially with a coffee :) It is pricey, but for a french restaurant, it's worth it - quality and all. You pay for a meal you'll never experience anywhere else in New York.",1
4615,490,4,8/14/2011,"Small restaurant upstairs. Go early or make reservations, otherwise you're out of luck. I had the duck special, I want to say it was great but I was leaving feeling nauseated. I still give this place a 4 based on what my fiance and friend had, burger and chicken were both fantastic. Overall, great ambiance, interesting place to be a part of.",1
4616,490,5,8/10/2011,"This is a stunning culinary experience. At $55, the lunch prix fixe is not only probably the best deal in town, but I think almost patently unfair to the restaurant considering what they offer. My guess is that they need to draw either folks from Midtown or Wall Street - neither an easy place to travel from in the middle of the day. Needless to say, the food is stupendous. One criticism I will offer is regarding the service. When I dine out, the best service is service that which is completely natural, and that if there are any errors or problems with the food, they are taken care of in such a way that I, the diner, am completely unaware. Here that was not the case. There were a number of servers who were working with a clear leader (not sure if he was a waiter or another front of the house employee, but clearly the boss) who seemed to be evaluating and criticizing everything the other servers were doing, in our presence. It led to a couple of awkward moments: first, at one point, the boss saw that a dessert plate had touched another dessert prior to being served and it may have had a drop of chocolate on the bottom of the plate. The boss gave an intense glare at the servers and quickly all the plates were taken away, and the offending dessert plate was quickly replaced. The second was that after my host paid the bill, one of the servers placed the credit card receipt (in a wooden chest) in front of me. Again, not a big deal at all, but the boss point out loudly to the server that he had given the receipt to the wrong person. The server moved it, but it was extremely obvious to all of us at the table how angry the boss was at the server for his mistake. With the tension in the air, my friends and I not-entirely-joked that the guy was taken away to be fired (or worse) by the boss. Look, you have insanely high expectations, and I appreciate that. Just don't make it so obvious to us how hard you're trying. The room downstairs is absolutely gorgeous, and a phenomenal place to dine in its own right - not just an alternative to the main dining room.",1
4617,490,5,8/9/2011,"Pretty amazing overall. Fantastic ambiance, nearly flawless service, and a bewildering array of flavors. The entry room has shelves lined with apples, filling the space with a sweet, welcoming aroma. The main dining room is absolutely beautiful, with vaulted ceilings and French country decor. We had the lunch tasters menu. Each course was beautifully plated and delivered by a small army of waiters who explained each dish in an enthusiastic, Â friendly way. The food was really excellent. Remarkable, un- expected combinations of flavors and textures, creatively combined to please the palate. The cheese foam under the asparagus was a first for me, as well as the ricotta sorbet accompanied by cold melon soup. Fascinating, like it or not. The only mild criticisms I can offer are that - the fish Carpaccio was a whirlwind of sauces and flavors, competing with the delectable raw fish. - the duck was a bit rare in spite of asking for it med well, and, while delicious, was not that interesting. - the army of waiters did not re- fold my napkin when I used the restroom, as they did for my dining companions. LOL. One of the highlights for me was the crab with truffle sauce. Fantastic flavors, generous portion. I did find one small chunk of shell, however. This dining experience was a near- perfect, rare treat for any foodie.",1
4618,490,2,8/8/2011,"Returning to Bouley for the tasting menu with the family, the entire thing tasted like baby food, although the other members of the group liked it better. Service was also slow. A real disappointment from their previous superb experience.",1
4619,490,3,8/5/2011,"I reserved for my wife's birthday with fond memories of the original Bouley. This was my first visit to the revived version. We were expecting one of the finer dining experiences in NY and unfortunately it falls short. The room is lovely. Fresh cut flowers and other touches make for a lovely decor. The attention to detail is everywhere. That said, the service seems a bit inexperienced and not up to the standard of NY's finest. Overall, dinner was a disappointment. Right from the amuse-boche - the theme and our issue with many of the dishes Â was set - many of them just have too much going on to the point of detracting from the overall taste. Â Case in point - the amuse-bouche itself - beets, avocado, green apple sorbet - nice idea - doesn't work. Â For the starters, the porcini flan with truffles and crab is a perfect example of the same problem. Â The crab is completely overwhelmed by the other ingredients. Â The lobster was well-prepared, perhaps a tad overdone and chewy, but Â the cream, peas and mushroom sauce again almost obscures the taste of lobster. Â The lamb was served with four different sauces, each distinct, none complementary to each other and one that tasted like cheap bbq sauce. Â Our advice to Mr. Bouely - decide what your want each dish to be and stick with it - the plate potpourri experience doesn't work. Â  My wife and I both had the tasting menu with wine pairings and the pairings were excellent, even if the pours were a bit skimpy. The ingredients are high quality, but many of the dishes lack a clear identity - too many flavors, often that don't work well together. For this money go to Daniel - no comparison.",1
4620,490,5,8/4/2011,"Excellent experience. Lovely decor and flowers, multiple people taking very good care of us without being intrusive. Porcini flan w truffles and prosciutto farm egg as appetizers Rack of lamb and seabass as main dishes Yes, the watermelon ricotta is amazing as well. Pretty much a perfect dining experience.",1
4621,490,4,8/3/2011,"So I made reservations a bit late... a few days before and they said the only ones available were at 530p or 1030p. I chose 530p. So we get there at 530p and there was only 1 other table. We finished dinner around 730p and the place was only about 50% full. Im not sure if its an NYC thing regarding their reservation system, but I thought it was a bit odd. Anyways, on to the more important matter. The amuse bouche was delightful (although since its been almost 2 months since i ate there I forgot what it was... but it doesnt matter since the amuse bouche changes daily anyways). For appetizers, we ordered: -Porcini flan (Alaska Live Dungeness Crab, Black Truffle Dashi) - it reminded me of the Vietnamese Crab and asparagus soup, but more tastier. However, I wasnt too happy to find a piece of the crabs exoskeleton or cuticle or whatever you call it. -New York State Foie Gras (Roasted with Clementine, Tangerine, Mandarine Orange, Aged Balsamic and Celeriac PurÃ©e) - tasty, however, my husband found a vein inside it. -Salad of Boston Bibb, Red Watercress, Mache, Silk Blue Kale Fresh Hawaiian Hearts of Palm, Juilenne of Royal Trumpet Mushrooms) - surprisingly good for a salad, but worth $25? Probably not. For entrees, we had: -Chatham Day Boat Lobster, Brown and White Honshimeji Mushrooms, Passion Fruit and Mango -Organic Colorado Rack of Lamb, Soubise of Cippolini, Zucchini Mint PureÃ©, Black Truffle Sauce -Organic Long Island Duck Roasted with White Truffle Honey, Vermont Chanterelles, Pencil Asparagus, Porcini Puree I cant complain about any of the entrees. They were all fabulous! If I had to pick one, I would definitely order the duck. After dinner, they brought us a palette cleanser which consisted of melon soup and ricotta sorbet, I believe. I usually am not a fan of ricotta, but it was very delish. We didnt order any dessert, but they brought us a tray of pastries anyways which consisted of butter cookies, macaroons.... Um, not good. The service was nice and we had several people wait on us. I love having French servers at a French restaurant... they just make it that much more authentic. The food did take a little bit in between, especially after we finished our entrees. We kind of just sat there until they approached us about desserts. As we left, the hostess handed us ladies a loaf of bread as a parting gift. I never had a restaurant give me a parting gift before. I imagine they had leftover bread and needed to get rid of it. It tasted like lemon pound cake. My friend said it was rather stale. I didnt eat it til the next day, so I cant really judge whether it was fresh of not. All in all, I would definitely come back to Bouley.... after trying the other French restaurants in Manhattan first, though. First French restaurant in NYC, so I cant really be a judge comparing Bouley to the other restaurants.",1
4622,490,4,7/27/2011,"I don't know if it's a good thing or bad (leaning towards the latter), the most memorable part of my dining experience at this Michelin-starred restaurant wasn't the food but rather the decor. Â From the wall of apples (whoa) to the furnishings, it reminded me of a granny's house: Warm and fuzzy yet old fashioned. Â You'd almost expect the furniture's to be covered with plastic. Â But aside from that , the culinary experience was, without a doubt, very pleasant and reasonably priced (relatively when compared to other Michelin restaurants). Â I highly recommend the Long Island duck as it was juicy, tender, and just bursting with flavor. Â In addition, the petit fours (a desert tray that reminded me of tea at the Ritz in London) and the gift bags were fun treats.",1
4623,490,5,7/24/2011,"We ate here during the summer heat wave and, thanks to the wonders of ConEd, the airconditioner wasn't working. Â At most restaurants, this would have been a fiasco, and we would have turned around and walked out the door, but at Bouley the staff were accommodating and adaptive. First, they brought out a cool amuse bouche and ice water to cool us down while we decided. I had the shrimp and scallops to start, followed by the lobster and my father had the bluefin tuna followed by the black sea bass. Everything was perfectly done, but the tuna and the lobster stood out as superb. I'd also note that they included a pair of chilled soups (melon with ricotta and strawberry with another cheese that I forget) on the house to clear our palates and keep us cool. Moreover, they brought out iced tea and coffee with dessert to cool us down. Dessert was equally great; amaretto flan and the chocolate souffle. Between the two, I'd take the souffle, but the maple ice cream served with the amaretto flan was outstanding; intense, creamy, and well-balanced. Again, the food was incredible, but what impressed me most was the way in which they dealt with air conditioning in the restaurant. What could have been a distaster turned into one of the better meals I've had.",1
4624,490,4,7/21/2011,"My experience with Bouley was a bit of a shit show, but some stories are best told in detail, so here goes. We decided to take the subway down, but being summer and the MTA all the trains stopped way above what we needed, so we walked about 10 blocks. Â We'd been out and about all day and didn't have time to change so once can only imagine the impression three, young, sweaty, disheveled Indian girls made. Â Regardless the maitre'd was very polite and masked any doubts she had about our suitability as patrons. Â  We had a vegetarian in our midst, so we decided to go a la carte. Â I asked for a recommendation for a good California chardonnay--as happens so often in the city he kept trying to push an old world burgundy on me. The meal was good overall, the meat was well seasoned and moist but I remember the vegetables being a bit mealy and overly buttered. Â It was a good meal, but not the best I've had. Â The most telling fact is I remember very little of the specifics of any of the dishes. Â  Desert was much better, though my sister did get a bit into her cups with the port. Â She spent the rest of the night drinking at Ward 3 and vomiting up her $150/plate dinner. The price point was high, but I expect that's partly why people come here. Â I do have the say the decorations were a tad odd, and instead of coming across as rustic French felt like Miss Havisham's apple cellar.",1
4625,490,1,7/20/2011,"I went to Bouley on Valentine's day. Â Ok, probably my first mistake, but an $800 dinner, is an $800 dinner, and I expected to have at least, a very good night. Â When we got there, they took us through the main dining room, down the stairs to the basement dining room. I was disappointed and upset, especially after having been shown the elegance of the main dining room, and on any other night I would have complained or walked out, but it was Valentine's day, and I thought I would try to be positive. But, throughout the entire meal, I couldn't help but feel like a second-class citizen. Â  To say that the two dining rooms are even remotely part of the same restaurant is absurd. Â The basement room should be a separate business entirely, as it shares none of the luxurious charm of the main dining room on the ground floor. Â Not only was the air on full blast throughout our entire meal (our candle had to be replaced twice because the wind blew hard enough to burn up all the wax; keep in mind this was february), but each time I asked a waiter if he or she could turn down the air, my request was ignored. Â We had to ask for the replacement candle as it went unnoticed by the staff once it became extinguished after only 20 minutes. We were seated so close to the door and we could actually smell the bathroom, although it was disguised heavily with an overpowering air freshener smell. Â At several points during our meal, we could see and hear the staff arguing with each other. Â Whatever frustrations they were dealing with, were uncomfortably close to our table; hardly the spirit of Valentine's Day. Â  I was not impressed with the food either. Â Everything was either dry and overcooked, or just plain tired. I realize that Valentine's Day is an opportunity for a restaurant to inflate their prices in order to create the atmosphere that their customers desire. Â I am not at all surprised by the prix fixe and I would expect that from almost every restaurant short of a Burger King on a day like February 14th. I most certainly expect it from a distinguished restaurant such as Bouley. Â What I didn't expect, however; was that the inflated price would feel like highway robbery. Â I knew it would be expensive, but I believed it would be worth every penny. We left feeling like we had been tied up and robbed. Â  Of course, we tried to compensate for the mediocrity of our experience with two glasses of Tattinger RosÃ© at the price of $26 per glass, as well as a good bottle of La Croix Beaucaillou at the price of $150 (one of the cheapest), and I do feel like those things were worth our money. Â  My complaints are not about the money, but rather, our experience in relation to the money spent. Â Bouley is simply cutting corners and cheating their customers out of what should be a sublime experience.",1
4626,490,5,7/3/2011,Favorite!,1
4627,490,5,7/1/2011,This certainly rivals some of the best restaurants in San Francisco. Â I'd put it in the likes of Gary Danko - which is hands down the best meal I've ever had. Â We got the the 10 course tasting menu and every dish was to die for. Â A must try for every New Yorker or tourist who is willing to shell out $200 a meal!,1
4628,490,5,6/28/2011,"Possibly one of the richest taste experiences of my lifetime. I found the food to be a perfect blend of traditional French style cuisine with a dash of unique flavor combinations. I came for a prix fixe lunch with a girlfriend who adores this restaurant, and I can now see why. We enjoyed the Bouley experience for a more affordable price from their dinner menu. Amuse Bouche: A delicate pumpkin or squash puree with a slightly sweet wafer served alongside. Course 1: Carpaccio of Kampachi, young big eye tuna, striped amber jack. When I ate this dish, I was left with the impression that each little garnish and sauce on this dish had a disctinct purpose. Course 2: Porcini flan with Alaskan live dungeness crab, black truffle dashi. HEAVEN. I nearly died from the heavenly scent of truffle wafting in the air when I opened my little copper serving dish. Inside was a buttery flan with delicate chunks of crab on top, all swimming in a truffle scented broth. Course 3: Organic Long Island duck glazed with hibiscus, with saffron and walnut risotto. The duck was as tender as slow-cooked pork and paired perfectly with the rich risotto. Palette Cleanser: Ricotta ice cream in honeydew. Refreshing! Dessert: Hot caramelized anjou pear, Valrhona chocolate, biscuit breton, hot toffee sauce, lemon verbena and tahitian vanilla ice cream. Perfect ending for a sublime meal. This is definitely a restaurant I will make reservations for every time I'm in NY.",1
4629,490,4,6/16/2011,"identity crisis: 1 star michelin that thinks it's a 3 star...i love bouley's signature intoxicating scent of apples as you walk through the entrance. the only memorable item was the foie gras with apples.. and even then, foie is so boring and trite nowadays. everything else was very good, but a passing thought. my lunch date had excused himself to the restroom, and the servers brought his plate to the table before he returned... that is a big NO NO in fine dining. they should have waited until he returned. we spent +$300 on lunch and wine for two. food and service did not live up to my expectations, nor the price. only a 1-michelin star restaurant, but they charge as if they are a 3-star michelin.",1

3088,490,5,6/4/2011,Absolutely amazing and satisfying. Â I went here yesterday for lunch with a colleague of mine. Â You walk into the dining room and it is another world. Â Time flows slowly and leisurely. Â The glass of Bordeaux blanc recommended by the staff set the wonderful tone. Â The bread was perfect. Â I had Porcini Flan to start with. Â The crab was so tender and the dashi broth went perfectly with the crab. Â I could not have enough of it. Â For entree I had the duck. Â It was the most tender and soft duck I ever had. Â The source was refined and I loved the hint of yuzu flavor. Â After the entree was complimentary ricotta cheese sorbet in melon juice. Â The combination of the cold and mild ricotta cheese and the room temperature melon juice was absolutely heavenly. Â Everything about the meal was simply perfect.,1

4633,490,5,5/26/2011,"Bouley is whimsical, fun and absolutely delicious! I went here for my sister's birthday. We were seated in the basement dining room. Although we were not in the main dining room, I actually enjoyed the basement a lot. It was smaller and more intimate. The night was started with amuse bouche. I believe it was pumpkin soup with a scoop of cheese and candied nut? Whatever it is, it was a very promising start for our evening. We started dinner with 2 appetizers. I had the porcini flan with crab and dashi. It's was really good. The flavor combination is wonderful, the texture is silky and smooth. My sister had the North Carolina Pink Shrimp And Cape Cod Sea Scallops sweet maine princess crab, point judith calamari, ocean herbal broth. I prefer my dish, I think the porcini flan just blew us off. And then we shared the foie gras. I can't differentiate roasted or pan fried foei gras. Foie gras is foei gras. they are always delicious. For the main course, I had the duck. I can certainly say that it was the best duck i've ever had. The meat was incredibly juicy. It was rather sweet in the bottom (from the honey truffle), but the beets neutralized the sweetness. It was really good. My sister had the black seabass. My sister enjoyed it very much. But she did agree that the duck was tastier. Before the dessert. They gave us 2 amuse bouche. The first one was a soup with a ricotta ice cream. I'm not a big fan of this one. Second one was 3 tiers of mini desserts. The desserts are a bit disappointing. The chocolate souffle is not really a souffle. It was really dense. My sister's dessert was also just ok. I would definitely go back to Bouley. Soon. Maybe after they change the menu. But maybe i should get the duck again.",1
4634,490,5,5/24/2011,"We went to this restaurant last year for my birthday. Â The meal was quite tasty but a few (minor) drawbacks left me wanting a bit more, but only slightly. Â Granted, we did arrive a bit on the early side and the the restaurant started out relatively empty. Â The wait staff was huddling in the corner enjoying their break before the mad rush arrived. Â Once guests began arriving this was quickly alleviated and I felt lest awkward having so many people watching as we ordered. The highlights: Our main waiter did his utmost to make sure we were satisfied in between training a new waiter. Â I ordered an appetizer (Fois Gras, my absolute favorite) and a main dish, I unfortunately can't recall what so long after going, along with dessert; my husband ordered the tasting menu. Â I was happy with what I received, but the head waiter did not want me to feel left out and requested that the chef make special small plates so we could enjoy the meal alongside one another. Â It is touches like these that only great restaurants do.",1
4635,490,5,5/14/2011,"LOVE this place. A great special occasion spot, though I must say the prices are not so high that it need be special occasion only. The food and service are first rate, and the ambiance is romantic and ""quietly"" lively. Â  Â One of those menus where it is difficult to make a choice, I wanted pretty much everything on the menu. The venison and duck are both excellent choices. Good wine list as well. Highly recommend and cannot wait to go back!",1

The ambiance is romantic, but devoid of any pretentiousness that sadly commonplace in many upscale NYC dining establishment. The service was refreshingly impeccable and warm. The food was romantically impressive. The porcini flan was definitely the highlight of the trio of appetizer we ordered. My brother simply adored the foie gras. The duck main course was faultless. The chocolate souffle was an indulgent finale to our meal. The complimentary desserts of apple tart was elegantly delicious. The only less satisfying part of our meal was the ricotta gelato with melon soup. Somehow, the dish lacked the symphony and delicate balance of the other dishes. Definitely a memorable food porn evening.",1
4637,490,5,5/11/2011,"This is the perfect restaurant for a special occasion or for when you want to impress someone. I took my mother to Mother's Day lunch here, and everything was perfect and lovely. They had a special Mother's day tasting menu. The flavors were all very unique and unlike anything else we're used to eating. My mom's favorite was the farmhouse egg in the cheese foam. My favorite was the John Dory wrapped in ramps. The only weird dish was the ricotta gelato in the cantaloupe ""soup."" That one did not taste good, and it was not acidic or sweet enough, I think. I appreciated the different artisanal breads that they offered as well. The restaurant ambiance is gorgeous and somewhat feminine, with lots of fresh flowers and beautiful furnishings. The service was extremely attentive and professional, and we were very impressed. Overall it was a lovely dining experience.

4639,490,5,5/9/2011,"Just had another fantastic Mother's Day celebration at Bouley. We dined downstairs in the newly refurbished Red Room--it's gorgeous! Service, as always, was perfect. George has taken great care of us for more than 12 years. We always request to dine with George. We requested a late lunch reservation (2:45), and finished lunch at 5:30. Our table was ready for us when we arrived. Chef Bouley has made many revisions to the menu, but has kept many of my favorites. We started the celebration with a gift from Chef Bouley: the exquisite sea urchin terrine for my sister and me, and a lovely oyster preparation for our mom. For our first course, we all selected the Organic Connecticut Farm Egg with Comte Foam, Steamed Polenta and Artichoke. This dish is a dream especially since I'm not a fan of either polenta or artichoke. When I mixed the soft cooked egg with all of its components, it becomes one of my most favorite dishes anywhere.. Mom and I ordered the Chatham Day Boat Lobster Grilled over Japanese Charcoal, Fresh Tahiitain Vanilla and Passion Fruit Dressing. The portion of lobster was huge (the size of main course dishes at many other fine restaurants). The aroma of vanilla hits first, and the dish is lovely. The lobster was perfectly cooked. My sister chose the Wild Alaskan Salmon glazed with Hibiscus, Hen of the Woods Mushrooms, Hass Avocado, Golden Apple, Horseradish and Salmon Trout Roe--she loved it. Our next course was a supplement to the menu--seared foie gras with a citrus sauce. We each received the largest pieces of the most perfectly prepared foie. Needless to say, this could have been our main course. Our proper main course was a long-time favorite: Long Island Duck Roasted with White Truffle Honey, Hudson Valley Rhubarb, Royal Trumpet Mushrooms, Spring Turnip and Date Puree. Bouley's duck is our favorite duck preparation, and we try to never miss it. Â Side dish of the famous and delicious pommes puree. Our first dessert was new for us: Melon soup with Ricotta Sorbet--perfect and refreshing. Our second dessert was also new for us: Meyer Lemon Tart, Ten Exotic Fruits and Amaretto Ice Cream. Â This dessert was perfect for us: light, refreshing and delicious! I had heard George mention to another table that the Hot Valrona Chocolate Souffle was recently revised, and I mentioned that I'd have to try it on my next visit. Well, George always making sure that we're happy, brought us one to share with the Meyer Lemon Tart. The Chocolate souffle was wonderful and now has a delightful white coffee cloud that makes the dish. It is accompanied by chocolate sorbet. My mom was so happy, and we promised her that we'll return to Bouley very soon!",1
4640,490,4,5/8/2011,"I took my mom here, along with my sister and fiancee, the day before Mother's Day for lunch....which at $55 for 5 courses is still a steal even though it was $45 up til recently and $36 before that...I think Bouley is trying to outpace those skyrocketing gas prices. Anyways...the portions aren't going to be big..so if you are a pro wrestler or a linebacker on steroids...this probably isn't the place for you. I was pleasantly satiated by meal's end though, so no complaints. The food was very good...the one mind-blowing course that sticks out is the porcini flan with crab and black truffle...WOW...I imagine this must be a signature dish that invokes rioting if there is any mention of it being removed from the menu. The bottle of Chardonney we had was good, not $88 good..oh yeah, those wine prices are pretty bad folks. Service was efficient but not personable.",1

Â  I suppose you could call it food coma, in a sense, without having to eat much but eat well. Â The service was attentive without being cloying. Â  Highly recommended.

4643,490,3,5/7/2011,"I dined May 4th for dinner. We had the Chef's tasting menu with wine pairing, which is $320+ per person with tax and tip. I do not believe this restaurant deserves a place amongst the top dining establishments. Bouley rarely changes the menu, regardless of season or freshness of product. Our amuse bouche was a tasty pumpkin and chestnut puree, a Fall dish, served in May, for example. So if your like theater rather than true gastronic talent, you may be pleased. But if you appreciate simple, fresh ingredients served without the reliance on truffle oils and emulsions designed to impress, you will be disappointed. In their desire to create consistency in their menu, they have created the McDonalds formula for fine dining. The $90 wine pairing simply pairs some wines that are offered by the glass in smaller portions. Â A bottle of Kosta Browne Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir that I purchase from the winery for $60 is on the wine list for $320, to give you an idea of wine markups. I will say it's a beatiful restaurant, servers are well trained, until it gets busy, dishes are attractively plated and presented. The flavors and combinations will be appealing to many people. But if you are a good cook, and have the ability to pull back the curtain, you will see, like the Wizard of Oz, that this is a business run to make money, not run for the passion of providing excellence in food. If you have a lot of money to spend on dinner, there are so many other good choices. And many other experiences can be savored for far less money.",1
4644,490,5,5/4/2011,"We had lunch at Bouley after a good friend got married down at City Hall. It was a brilliant lunch. We did the five course fixed-price lunch and every course was perfect. I started with the kampachi (perfect) and then had a smoked salmon course (perfect). Two of my dining companions this amazing Alaskian king-crab leg dish for this course. King crab legs and truffle oil among other things. I was able to steal a bite and it was spectacular. I think we had a small trout dish in between that delicious (oh, and there was a great small cup of pumpkin soup to start) and then I had a great duck breast dish that was also... perfect. Everything they brought out was delicious. Although, note that there is a chocolate dessert they do (forget the name) that is huge; the four of us could have easily shared it. I'd avoid that unless you are a glutton. Bottom line: If you have the time for a long lunch, their $45 for a five(+) course lunch may be one of the best deals in the city.",1
1081,490,5,4/28/2011,"The cuisine at Bouley is an interesting cross between old-school french cuisine with rich creamy sauces / purees and modern techniques of making different foams and clouds. Â Dinner was wonderful and the wine pairings were very nice: 1. Â Starting with a roasted chestnut soup amuse, topped with a ricotta cheese ""cloud"". 2. Â Uni terrine with ossetra caviar 3. Â Chattham oyster with a lemon cloud 4. Â Porcini flan with dungeness crab and black truffles (wow!) 5. Â Chatham Lobster with mushrooms and fresh fruit 6. Â Farm egg with artichoke polenta and comte foam 7. Â Scallops tandoori 8. Â Boneless rack of lamb with zucchini-mint, onion, olive, and potato purees. Â Easily one of the best lamb dishes I've ever had in my life, and I'd go so far as to say even better than the French Laundry. 9. Â Duck breast with almond foam and truffle honey 10. Â Chilled coconut soup with pineapple sorbet 11. Chocolate souffle, chocolate ice cream, white chocolate foam (double wow!) We came late (drinks at Weather up next door first) and service was still very good. Â Restaurant wasn't full so there wasn't a lot of waiting in between courses, which personally I find to be nice on a weeknight. Bouley is in that middle ground, a solid 1-Michelin star but still trying to figure out how to get over the hump to 2 stars. Â I think if they continue to innovate and refine their style to be more modern and less old-school they can get there in the next few years. Â I look forward to seeing what they do next year.",1
4645,490,5,4/25/2011,"Upon arriving, you see that the restaurant will be a charming experience from the beautiful wood door entrance that leads into a foyer/cellar of apples with an overpowering apple aroma (I don't know if this aptly explains the experience, but if you go you will understand - very unique!) The restaurant is exceptional. The service upon arrival is tremendous. The staff is very gracious and welcoming, moving at a relaxed and comfortable pace, which is a little different from the traditional hustled pace that I felt at other NYC restaurants. The food was absolutely magnificent and delicious. Overall, a wonderful experience. I can see why Bouley has multiple Michelin stars! Â If you want the very best and want a charming experience, this is it.",1
4646,490,2,4/19/2011,"Pretentious, they feel like they are in France and the food is fine, but it took hours between each plate. After asking for the second plate you want to go out and pay the check of the bad timing of the service. You just want to leave the plate. Boring, old fashion new yorkers, that means really old. Very conservative. the lobster i ate was good. Overated. Not so expensive. I was so anxious to leave that i didn't ask for a dessert, and they brung three different types of desert. Hilarious. Â  The apple lobby is beautiful and smells incredible, the restaurant is like a villa. I will never recommend it and will never go back.",1
4647,490,5,4/17/2011,"I shall not pretend to be some sort of posturing epicure and tendentiously assert a verbose (and ultimately nugatory) account of my gastronomic enlightenment here. Instead, my simple encomium states that here, I experienced one of my most enjoyable meals in New York to date. Everything from the apple orchard antechamber, to the unquestionably delectable courses, to the delightful serving staff, to the impressive French parlor decor, to the exquisite wines and champagne, to the gratuit lemon cakes the ladies were presented with upon departure... was nothing short of perfectly magnificent. Davied Bouley has truly discovered how to reveal the sybarite in us all.",1
4648,490,4,4/14/2011,"Spent the night with clients at Bouley with high expectations Â of exceptional food. The restaurant is lovely; service attentive; excellent, reasonable wine list and noise level sufficiently low to allow for actual conversation. We where all, however, disappointed Â with the food. Although the ingredients where very high quality, the recipes were so complicated that they overwhelmed the taste buds. Great appetizers but the entrees and desserts fell far short for such a prestigous Â establishment. A sophisticated group of New Yorker's Â left feeling underwhelmed by an overwhelming menu. Since there are so many wonderful reviews, I can only hope that this was an anomaly but regardless, none of us will return.",1
4649,490,4,4/14/2011,"love this place! been here twice for lunch (at $45 for tasting menu its a steal!). love the space it reminds me of somewhere in provence. food is good too. had the kampachi first, reminiscent of le bernadins first course. next was the porcini flan - this is a winner! like a savoury creme brulee version of agedashi tofu..mmm.. for main ive tried long island duck, the venison, and the chicken. the latter 2 were unremarkable but the duck was great. then for dessert we had the chocolate platter and the anjou pear. there was way too much on the chocolate plate, a bit overdone. anjou pear was nice. service is a bit flaky though. didnt ask to take our coats, didnt get our name/reservation when we entered, had a dirty napkin, forgot to charge us for a wine (not that i complained!)",1
4650,490,4,4/11/2011,"Went here over the weekend for a special occasion and was extremely pleased. Â As others have stated, the fresh apple aroma that greets you when you open the door completely envelops you; you can't help but to relax and smile. Â Ordered the tasting menu with champagne and was very pleased with service throughout dinner; the food however was a bit hit and miss for me. Amuse bouche--a small taste of pumpkin and chestnut. Â Tasty, however was a little too heavy for an amuse. 1st Course, Sea urchin terrine with russian golden oscetra caviar--sounded better on paper than executed. Â I love terrines, however it just does not work well with something as un-meaty as sea urchin. Â The urchin roe was very creamy but not sweet at all. Â In the end, the aspic was just too overwhelming. 2nd Course, Chatham day boat lobster, honshimeji mushrooms, passion fruit & mango, lychee, Â hyssop--nice fresh flavors, lobster was a little chewy to cut. Â My date ordered the porcini flan with dungeness crab and black truffle, which was amazing. Â The flavors harmonized very well and had lots of crab meat. 3rd Course, Fresh hamachi, variety of squashes, ginger aromatic--the hamachi is cooked (I was expecting sashimi style, but in retrospect, the adornments suggest a cooked dish) and was very nicely executed. Â Flavors were clean and simple. Â My date got the scallops, tandoori, and cauliflower puree, which was very very good. Â The scallop was cooked perfectly and the dish very flavorful. Â  Complimentary course, monkfish and I forget the sauce--by this point we were getting very full which was a shame considering service graciously presented us a complimentary dish since it was a special occasion. Â The fish was cooked nicely, but the dish was pretty mundane. 4th Course, venison, black truffle gnocchi, blue kale, brussel sprout leaves, pruneaux d'agen--very tasty dish; venison was nicely cooked and not game-y at all. Â The truffle gnocchi was delicious. Â My date ordered the rack of lamb with three accompanying sauces. Â Be prepared for a large serving of meat...neither of us expected two sizeable hunks of lamb at this point into a tasting menu. Â Lamb was gamier than I was used to, but I like that. Â  5th Course, chilled strawberry soup, organic yogurt sorbet--I repressed the majority of this dish experience since I had a TON of yogurt/dairy with a combination of indian food the day before (bad mixture). 6th Course, ""snowball"" with lychee, ice cream (forgot the flavor)--the snowball is essentially a frozen meringue in the shape of a ball with lychee filling inside. Â It was fine; not mind-blowing. Â My date had the souffle paired with chocolate sorbet. Â Her complaint was that she wished the ice cream was vanilla instead to provide the flavor contrast against the chocolate souffle. Â Service also provide the anjou pear chocolate tart with three ice creams as a complimentary dish. Â I enjoyed it. Apperitif, mini macarons, assorted cookies--TFDE (Too full; didn't eat) If that wasn't enough, they gave us a complimentary lemon pound cake loaf to take home. Â  TLDR: Don't eat the day before you come here.",1
4651,490,3,4/10/2011,The most underwhelming meal in my memory from this caliber restaurant. Everything was just ok. Food was tasty but not inspired. If you want to shell out this kind of money save it for Gramercy tavern or Jean gorges,1
4652,490,4,4/8/2011,I love their crab soup!! It's the best I've ever had!! Â I would definitely eat here again if I happen to be in New York.,1
4653,490,5,4/4/2011,This is a great restaurant for a special occasion. The room with the vaulted ceilings is beautiful. The food is delicious and the service is great. Absolutely love!!,1
4654,490,5,4/2/2011,"I'm in heaven just thinking about my meal here. It was for Valentines day, and we did a chef's tasting with wine pairing. The entrance was filled with around a thousand granny smith apples, and the scent was so nice just walking in. Service was great, wine pairing was very memorable and the food was really good. Porcini flan with dungeness crab, in black truffle dashi- yes, it was good as it sounds. Also had the foie gras, lobster and ended with duck. Yum, but I don't exactly remember the names of all the dishes. Â  The only thing I remember not enjoying as much as the rest of the meal was the dessert. Besides that it was a perfect night.",1
4655,490,5,4/1/2011,"I'd rate 97% 'Woohoo' indeed!! Absolutely the best lunch and best value for a meal I've ever had! Killer, almost flawless 5-course tasting meal for a steal of $45. Wonderfully prepared fish dishes with straightforward flavors that blew me away, even without pairings. Very good pairing with a Dover Sole dish. Excellent, heavenly sauces. Flavors here are refreshingly subtle, clean, and did a wonderful job of showcasing Spring flavors (we visited late March, 2011). Beautiful, immaculate presentation. Consistent, clean, subtle, & refreshing Spring theme. Every dish I had here was top-notch, but my favorite was their Dover Sole paired with a white Bordeaux. Least favorite dish was their pumpkin soup starter and petite fours, a relatively minor issue perhaps. Currently ties with 'Le Bernardin' (Manhattan, NY) as my favorite restaurant! Wonderfully attentive service, without any snobbery. Beautiful, intimate, and comfortable dining environment. ***Detailed Review*** We both started off with their pumpkin soup. Â This wasn't a bad dish at all. Â Definitely pleasant, and subtle. Â  Nothing impressive in terms of flavor, texture, or originality, that I could appreciate at least. For our first course, I opted for their ""Carpaccio of Kampachi, Young Big Eye Tuna, and Striped Amber Jack, prepared in a Mediterranean manner"" Â That is the wording from their menu. Â Basically three slices of excellent Sashimi with a spring dressing and some greens. Â The flavors here are more French than Japanese. Â I had trouble figuring out the flavors used, save for a light vinaigrette (could be completely off) light dressing that complemented the fish well, Â Temperate was lightly chilled. Â Very good dish, and I damn myself for not going with a pairing. Â I felt this would have been a preferable way to start our lunch. My GF opted for the ""Boston Bibb, Red Watercress, Fresh Hawaiian Hearts of Palm, Julienne of Royal Trumpet Mushrooms"". Â Veggies are wonderfully fresh here, and the effect is again a very clean tasting dish, whereas all the ingredients complement each other in harmony. Â Flavors, texture, presentation, it has it all. Â As much as I enjoyed my wonderful Sashimi, I felt this was the slightly stronger dish. Â It's pretty much the perfect salad. Â  For our second offering, I chose their ""Black Cod Marinated with Pistachio Miso, Organic Buckwheat, Ginger Aromatic Sauce"". Â Description in the menu is slightly vague, and I don't think it explains all that is going on, for better or worse. Â Perfectly moist fish, again with very light flavors. Â Wonderful subtle play in texture with the buckwheat. Â Again, this is a pretty light dish. Â There's a good deal of complexity going on in the flavors, but it all works so seamlessly that it could be taken for granted. Â This is black cod perfected in my humble opinion. My GF went with their ""Organic Scottish Salmon, Lightly Cured, Indian Red River Grapefruit, Clemantine & Blood Orange, Parsnip Puree, fresh Almond Broth"". Â Fish cooked to a nice medium rare, although I would have personally preferred a more rare preparation. Â The fruit work well in unison for Â the fish. Â  The flavors here are comparably more robust than our others, and carried the theme of a wonderful spring tasting menu. Â Very accessible and effective dish! Â My GF felt this was the best dish of our lunch tasting. Third course we opted for their ""Dover Sole Roasted with Flat Leaf Spinach, Passion Fruit and Blood Orange Dressing"" Â I requested the sommalier for a pairing, and he offered a bold white Bordeaux. Â Best dish of the day. Â The fish came with roasted spicy tomato flakes and some roasted nuts that I couldn't recognize. Â Along with the greens, this was sublime in flavor and texture. Â Probably was the most complex and experimental dish as well. The white Bordeaux brought out the flavors even more. Â I was almost in tears, it was so beautiful. Â Perfection, My GF went with the ""All-Natural Pennsylvania Chicken Squash Ravioli, Vermont Chanterelles, Carrot & Persimmon Dressing"". Â Chicken breast was used here. Â This was one of their most straightforward and hearty dishes. Â It comes with a light cream persimmon sauce. Â Chicken breast is pleasantly moist and buttery. Â Chanterelles add a welcome touch. Â Along with their excellent potato puree, it worked great! Â Flavors are pretty robust, but there isn't too much complexity here. Â Nice classical cooking. As far as desserts, their Coconut soup, which resembled a coconut yogurt over granita worked superb. Â Maybe a tad heavy, but a great palate cleanser. Â If portions were a little smaller, I felt it would be more effective. ""Hot Caramelized Anjou Pear, Valrhona Chocolate, Biscuit Breton, Hot Toffee Sauce, Rosemary & Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream"" Â was heavenly. Â Again, the flavors and textures complemented each other wonderfully. Â It deserves a pairing. Not a huge fan of the ""Chocolate Frivolous"", but the ice cream was once again a delight! Very very impressive!",1
4656,490,4,3/31/2011,"Everything was spectacular. Went there for the lunch tasting menu (can't be beat - $48 for a 5 course tasting) The porcini mushroom flan was outstanding with generous amounts of crab meat. Everything else was amazing, but definitely the flan was the one that stood out. And the desserts just kept coming after the savory courses (a bit too much sweets - 2 desserts plus 2 sorbets plus a tray of macaroons and chocolates).",1
4657,490,5,3/31/2011,We had countless meals on our trip and this was easily the standout. Â The flavors envelope you into a euphoric coma. Â  Come for their lunch tasting menu... you belly and wallet will thank you!,1
4658,490,5,3/30/2011,"5 stars are for the sheer value for money for their Saturday lunch menu (now $45). A high quality place, professional service and excellent food. Â  I wouldn't say it's the best french food I've had (that was in France) but very good especially for the price. Currently my favorite NYC lunch place. Â I'll return.",1
4659,490,3,3/30/2011,"So, let me start out by saying that the food was really excellent. Creative, but not too edgy/weird, perfectly sized portions, really well executed. So why the 3 star review? I went there this past week end with hubby for my b-day and there was a NY notable having a big party and all service went to him. Additionally, there was a Spanish couple next to us which received the bulk of the rest of the attention that the staff could spare. We ended up waiting over an hour for dessert, which we ended up skipping, and I was disappointed that I didn't get a little bag of mignardise to take home (which I prefer over dessert). The good: - Excellent food - Beautiful restaurant - Good value The bad: - Service can be spotty Still, I prefer Bouley over Le Bernadin and Daniel based on the food alone. The lunch deal is a STEAL at only $45, and I would absolutely, without a doubt, return for that, but would be hesitant to return for dinner. I'd be too worried that I wouldn't get the attention I expect for an establishment of this caliber.",1
4660,490,4,3/21/2011,"The service here is absolutely top notch. It was the first time I had ever noticed how spectacular service can make you love a place. The waiters were attentive, conversational but not too chatty, and very classy. Food was great as well. Had the cod and it was delicious. The wine selection was great as well. I'd recommend it for an important business dinner or for a romantic meal with someone love.",1
4661,490,5,3/17/2011,"The best lunch I've ever had - longwinded review in the blog, high points below: Carpaccio of Kampachi, Young Big Eye Tuna, and Striped Amber Jack 'prepared in a Mediterranean manner.' Â A substantial portion of high quality ceviche-style fish paired with unseasonably bold tomatoes and an array of microgreens with a mild dusting of salt and black pepper the course was dazzling both visually and texturally - an appropriately delicate way to begin the meal. Sea Urchin Terrine with Golden Osetra Caviar and Vodka CrÃ¨me Fraiche would prove to be quite present indeed. Â Served as two fresh tongues of uni - one raw and the other encased in a gelatin block tasting like the essence of the sea the dish was anchored in a bitter yet tangy cream amplified by small dots of briny caviar and basil oil. Â While admittedly homogenous in texture, the flavor of the dish was anything but - at times sweet and at others savory it was just a beautifully executed composition. Sauteed John Dory with sweet peas, celery root puree, and black Truffle Sauce. Â Featuring my favorite fish there was little chance for this dish to fail, though I must note it was not as impressive as the uni. Â Flaky and sweet the St Pierre itself was quite tasty - clearly sautÃ©ed in butter and all the better for it. Â Where the dish missed for me, however, was actually the black truffle sauce which although good was so potent with the nose of truffle that it overwhelmed the delicate fish and celery root. Porcini Flan, Alaska Live Dungeness Crab, Black Truffle Dashi. Â Served in a small dish and uncovered tableside with a bit of steam and plenty of earthy aromatics greeting the nose the first thing to note about the dish is that it tastes much better than it looks. Â Clearly Asian in influence the heady dashi dotted with large chunks of crab is lovely - it makes the dish despite getting second billing in the title. Â Digging deeper, to the bottom, the creamy custard greets the palate with earthy tones - a sort of balance to the savoriness above - and when mixed thoroughly the amalgam simply ""works."" Organic Connecticut Farm Egg, Serrano Ham, Steamed Polenta, Artichoke, Sunchoke, Coconut Garlic Broth dish was an obvious choice and perhaps my favorite course of the meal. Â With the cured ham actually served in four strips cupping the egg the breakfasty aspect of the dish was spot on and melded nicely with the substantially buttery polenta. Â Adding nuance, crispy artichoke and shaved parmesan plus one of the most unique ""broths"" I've ever experienced - on one hand milky and sweet but on the other potent with garlic. Scrambled Connecticut Farm Egg, Black truffle, Mascarpone, and Comte was not nearly as complicated as its predecessor, but was every bit as good. Â With the egg itself whipped with black truffles and mascarpone to form an aromatic cloud of flavor, the dish was topped tableside with grated 24 month aged compte - a decidedly luxurious touch. Organic Long Island Duck Roasted with White Truffle Honey, Vermont Chanterelles, Pencil Asparagus, Porcini Puree and a side of buttered pommes puree. Â Beginning with the mashed potatoes - they aren't Robuchon - a tad more texture - but they aren't too far off. Â Moving on to the duck - rosy on the inside and bronzed on the exterior the flavor was quite excellent - sweet and supple, but unfortunately not fatty or crispy enough on the exterior to rival the fowl at Eleven Madison Park or Corton. Â Certainly a competent dish and again impressive in portion I'll note the accompanying vegetables and fungi were quite nicely prepared - tender and flavorful, nicely paired with the earthy mushroom sauce and sweet foam. To this moment I cannot imagine why I was treated so well at Bouley - no special requests were made, I was dressed no better than anyone else in the restaurant, and aside from my e-mail inquiring whether photos were allowed and if Chef Bouley would be cooking on Saturday my reservation was no different than any other. Â A substantial bargain for amuse/five courses/mignardises my meal turned out to be so much more - not only was it amuses and mignardises plus nine course and a delectable gift to take home for myself and my friends, it was also an experience I will always remember and to this date the best lunch of my life - a meal so good that I'm tempted to go back on my upcoming March visit to the Big Apple with my only reluctance being that it seems impossible Bouley could repeat such magic.",1
4662,490,5,3/17/2011,"THIS IS TRUE LOVE!! Â  1. The Food~ EXCELLENT 2. Service Â  ~ EXCELLENT 3. Ambiance~ EXCELLENT I loved walking through the door and smelling the fresh apples that lined the entire wall of the vestibule you walk through. Â The hostess was very kind and had impeccable manners. Â We were seated in the small back room, which was very intimate and cozy. Â The service was always on par and never in your face, like a beautiful wallpaper that accentuates a room and not makes the room. Â What made the room was the FOOD of course. Â EXCELLENT!",1
4663,490,5,3/15/2011,"I feel like there's not much to add to these reviews, except that you should make a reservation for lunch now. Lunch is ridiculous; I have no idea why they charge so little for it. It was so much food...all delicious and nicely prepared with high quality ingredients. There were many choices, so everyone was happy; I want to go back and try the dishes I didn't get a chance to try. I had the chocolate dessert which was more like 10 different types of desserts on one plate (and this was after the pre-dessert coconut soup dish). The drink I had was delicious, and I can't say enough good things about the service. One person in our party was an hour late, and they knew I only had an hour and half (which turned into half an hour), so they did an amazing job accommodating these constraints. I can't wait to go back and have time to enjoy each dish!",1
4664,490,5,3/11/2011,"Pricey but amazing venue and the food hands down was one of my best experiences in NYC. They have exceptional service and great attention to detail. I guess this is what you would expect from an establishment of this caliber however many do not deliver, Bouley does.",1
4665,490,5,3/1/2011,"The boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner. It was difficult to find at night because the street it's on splits off unevenly. Â Inside, the restaurant was cavernous and romantically lit. Â The crowd seemed kinda haughty, as expected of a fine dining establishment as this. Â Lots of suits and quite a lot of old couples. Â The old couples were cute. Once settled, We had the tasting menu and it was fantastic. Â All the courses were delicious. Â My favorite was the lobster. Â While picking our courses, I was conflicted over 2 desserts and finally settled on one. To my surprise, our server brought out both desserts for me! Awesome! Â  Service was impeccable and unpretentious. I'm also biased due to the extra dessert. They even give mignardises at the end, which we happily took home to savor. =)",1
4666,490,5,3/1/2011,"I dined here for lunch and had the prixe fixe menu. I can't disagree more with Mike S.'s review of the porcini flan, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Â I thought this was by far the best dish of the meal.",1
4667,490,4,2/23/2011,"Lives up to its name. Excellent tasting menu. good service. i highly recommend the duck and rack of lamb. cooked just right. very juicy. I would like to see a better dessert menu though. all in all, excellent !",1
4668,490,5,2/22/2011,"Top 5 all time for me. And it didn't hurt that it was only $45 per tasting. The place looks (and smells) fabulous without seeming fussy. We were there during the day which was very nice, but after dark they set out beautiful white tapers on every table. The service was polished but never uptight. They accommodated what I expected to be a difficult special request (no mushrooms), and we walked out full and happy. We chose the asparagus, carpaccio, garlic and almond soup, venison, and chicken. All excellent. I'd love to go back just to try the other options I've read about in these reviews. There was also a tasty amuse and a chilled soup before dessert. And dessert...the Chocolate Frivolous was as insane and over-the-top as you've read, but I also really liked the Snowball which was the most originally beautiful dessert I've ever seen. It looks like a thrown snowball would at the moment it hit the plate, but spooning away the coating revealed vibrant oranges and reds. A truly amazing creation, and it tasted as good as it looked.",1
4669,490,5,2/21/2011,"One of the best meals I have had in a long time! Three of us tried the lunch pre fixe menu. Every course of the meal was delectable, just the right portion (this is not one of those French meals where you leave hungry :-)), Â and perfectly cooked! They have an enchanting selection of seasonal dishes for each course to appeal to a wide variety of palettes. One of my friends, who was dining with us, and has eaten there before, noted that their menu changes at least every season. We are hoping to go back again soon, or at least next season! My selections: Course 1: Carpaccio, Young Big Eye Tuna & Striped Amber Jack, Prepared in a Mediterranean manner (FAVORITE 2), Course 2: Porcini Flan, Alaska Live Dungeness Crab, Black Truffle Dash (MY FAVORITE 1), Course 3: New Zealand White Fallow Venison with Black Truffle Gnocci, Blue Kale, Brussels Sprout Leaves (AMAZING!), Course 4: Chilled Coconut Soup with Pineapple Granite, Organic Yogurt Sorbet Palette Cleanser (OK), Course 5: Hot Caramelized Anjou Pear, Valrhona Chocalate, Biscuit Breton, Hot Toffee Sauce, Rosemary & Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream (LOVED) I highly recommend this place!",1
4670,490,4,2/21/2011,"I normally don't like a lot of creamy food, which means French is not always my thing but I greatly appreciated the Chef's thoughtfulness in creating innovative dishes and thouroughly enjoyed being pampered by the staff. Now there is a concept you don't hear about NY restaurant staff very often! We did the tasting menu and stuck with seafood. The sea urchin appetizer was out of this world as were most breads, especially the saffron one that just melted in the mouth. Carpaccio was on the other hand, was just okay, wouldn't recommend it. The Dunguness crab was fantastic. Every item was very thoughtfully done andI liked that the presentation was unfussy yet sweet. Our captain was very sweet & affable. The service was efficient & great. The chef sent over complementary dessert- paper thin pineapple slices with crystallized cilatro- was also wonderful. Also left with a complimentary lemon pound cake from the chef's bakery. Didn't know you had to ask to be seated in the main dining room when you make a reservation - highly recommend it- its a grand room indeed. We were happy to get a sort of a last minute reservation at the ""private room"". The ladies' room was an experience - don't miss it!",1
4671,490,5,2/19/2011,"My boss took me here for a lunch.. I was really intimidated at first of the somewhat stuffy atmosphere at first. The maitr'd greeted us in a charming French accent, and led us into what looked like an extremely well-decorated study'/living room of an old-world mansion.. The atmosphere was cozy.. the food was superb and unique though the lunch did take us 2.5 hours even with rushing.. Overall the experience was great.. every course was flavorful and different than the last.. As is expected of Michelin rated restaurants.. The lunch is also a great value for the caliber of the restaurant.",1
4672,490,1,2/19/2011,"My wife and I had high hopes for this restaurant. We are fans of Daniel and Jean Georges, and even a beautiful little restaurant in Boulder (CO) called L'Atelier, so our assumption was that Bouley would at least be in the same league. Wrong. This restaurant is for fans of disinterested service, unimaginative cuisine, and dungeon-style environs (we were in the ""private"" dining room). Advice to lunch goers: stay far, far away from the Boston Bibb - it's literally a few pieces of lettuce stacked on top of arugula and mushrooms (we make better salads at home) - an unsightly and disappointing effort from the kitchen of Chef Bouley. This dish would NOT pass in any self-respecting restaurant in Provence. The carpaccio was a very simple crudo; these guys could really learn from the wintergreen tuna that Jean Georges used to offer. We ordered some chilled chatham oysters a la carte: flavors were acceptable, although I really would have preferred a simple goat cheese or mascarpone instead of their ""lemon cloud"", which I felt overwhelmed the other flavors in the dish, particularly the oysters themselves. Boo on that. This is what the porcini flan tasted like: crack one egg into a bowl, add some water, toss in lump crab meat, put in the microwave on HIGH for 45 seconds, and BAM you have their porcini flan. The salmon was fine but really could have used a nice sear. Duck was fine ... if you've never had nice duck before. Coming from someone who enjoys the intense flavors of Beijing Roast Duck (in Beijing, not Chinatown), this creamy bland version of duck really paled in comparison. It's one thing if the flavors were to exhibit a high level of sophistication, but sorry, merely adding some foam doesn't quite count. Venison was reminded me of a strange take on a popular chinese dish called ""mutton with soaked bread"" except not nearly as good. I am not convinced gnocchi ought to go with anything that is not tomato-based unless there is a toast or sear or something that provides some sort of mediation. Coconut soup was basically whole-milk yogurt with shaved ice. You could tell the milk they used for the yogurt came from healthy cows, although at this type of restaurant that's expected. Dessert was excellent, particularly the chocolate, although the pear was no slouch. In summary, restaurants like Daniel and Jean Georges have this joint thoroughly dominated in every respect - except for maybe the furniture, and perhaps the dessert course. Warning to first-time customers: when you reserve, be sure to indicate you want to sit in the ""main dining room only"". Otherwise there is a good chance you will be whisked to the basement (read: dungeon) where there is no natural light, and despite the neo-French decor, lacks a feeling of warmth.",1
4673,490,4,2/18/2011,"Rarely have I encountered such a case when the gustatory component of an upscale dining experience was so unbalanced with the quality of service provided. Before you read on, I want to clarify. I definitely recommend Bouley! Let yourself become enveloped by the warmth and grandeur of the restaurant, with its floral curtains and indoor white pillars. My mother and I had the lunch tasting menu. If I were to describe the day's meal, I would say that it was a compilation of simple and yet sophisticated tastes and flavors that were both comforting and creative at the same time. The breads to start, the apple raisin mini loaf, herbed baguette, pistacchio rye, olive sourdough, and walnut rye were fun to taste. The bib salad, upon first inspection, seemed boring - a pretty arrangement of clean leaves, but beneath the greenery was heart of palm thinly sliced and paired with trumpet mushrooms that were tossed in a refreshing dressing. My tongue could not dissect the intricate flavors of the sauce, but truly, it was perfect for the marrying of crisp heart of palm and tender mushrooms. The porcini flan, OH the porcini flan!! If I hadn't known any better I would've thought this to be a Chinese crab soup complete with the corn starched broth. Hints of butter tickle your fancy, and you're brought back to the French essence of the dish. My mom, after her first spoonful, covered her mouth and said to me ""can we come back again?!"" The duck came with a most brilliant sauce, a trick of both the sweet and savory - honey and porcini puree. Even the palate clearing selection was excellent - perhaps even more notable than the actual dessert dish - a yogurt gelato, whose tartness so wonderfully contrasted with the slightly sweet and crunchy pineapple granite, all atop a smooth coconut soup. Bouley serves spectacular food - 5 stars!! But the service leaves much to be desired. Inconsistency was the theme of the day. Some servers were incredibly polite, thoughtful, and accommodating (from folding your napkin to pulling out your chair for you to directing you to the restroom), while others were not so attentive and even a bit cold. Our neighbors at a nearby table were given full descriptions of the ingredients of each dish when dishes were brought to their table, while our servers only did so for the amuse bouche and otherwise somewhat carelessly dropped off our other food and left. Lastly I'll note that the dishes came out a bit too fast, so I did feel like I was getting rushed to finish my lunch. At a fine dining restaurant such as Bouley, that's definitely not something a patron should experience. I sincerely hope that servers and managers alike read this review. Every restaurant could benefit from some constructive criticism, and I do hope that upon my return the service at Bouley will be just as wonderful as the food served. I can't wait to be back!",1
4674,490,5,2/18/2011,"OK, so I know this place doesn't need any more reviews, but i LOVED my lunch experience here a few weeks ago and had to yelp about it. I'm typically not a fancy person, but a coworker invited me to join her quarterly lunch bunch and I said TOTALLY. Apparently if people in your party don't show, you get penalized $50! this place is serious. Make sure everyone shows up. I thought this was going to be a 4 course prix fixe, but it was more like 5 or 6! with the amuse bouche, specific breads per course, and dessert tray, I was stuffed to the brim. But not in a gross way. Everything was so delicious and artfully prepared. It was like each of us had our own waiter. I definitely felt fancy. final note: Chocolate Frivolous - definitely not to be misse! OMG, this was 6 different chocolate desserts on one plate - some cold some hot, all super delicious. I want to eat here everyday.",1
4675,490,5,2/17/2011,"incredible place. the service is wonderful without being pretentious. each dish is delicious. and the lunch prixe fix is hard to beat ($36)! i was going to write an extensive review, but Miawling L. did a pretty awesome job of it below. so read that. :) if you haven't made it out here yet, DO! my favorite was the chocolate platter at the end - and i'm not even the hugest fan of chocolate! but this thing was seriously a meal in itself, featuring 5 differenct chocolate desserts and ice creams. amazing. better than jean george's!",1
4676,490,5,2/16/2011,"Brian took me here for dinner on a friday night & I was so impressed! usually, we pick out the restaurant together but he did so well choosing this one on his own! SETTING: i love everything about this place! you come in to the foyer & greeted with floor to ceiling shelves of fresh apples! then, past the maÃ®tre d, there's the lounge, which leads up to the big dining room. venetian finished walls & massive wooden doors make you feel like you're in a stone cellar! we were then led downstairs to a more private & well lit dining area. FOOD: ROASTED PUMPKIN SOUP: they started us off with bowls of this sweet soup. wow - great flavor! our server said that the pumpkin was roasted with maple syrup. so yummy. i love the flavors of this - very comforting & definitely made me feel welcome! the portion is so apropos - just enough to tickle your tastebuds! PINK SHRIMP + CAPE COP SEA SCALLOPS ON SWEET MAINE PRINCESS CRABMEAT: love love love!!! this whole thing is sitting on a light broth. also, i didn't realize that the huge piece of scallop was sitting atop shredded crabmeat - SO AMAZING!!! ROASTED NEW YORK STATE FOIE GRAS: omg!!! melt-in-your-mouth goodness! amaingly cooked & seasoned, super tender & served at the perfect temperature. if you're a fan of foie gras, get this. you can't go wrong! with flavors of red & golden raspberries with cassis, it's like flavored butter! ROASTED COLORADO RACK OF LAMB: brian's entree. served medium & perfectly pink! the meat is very tender & the starch/sauce greatly complements this dish. CHATHAM DAY BOAT LOBSTER: ZOMFGASDJFG!!!!!!!! i never order lobster but im glad i got this as my meal. three hunks of lobster meat with honshimeji mushrooms, passion fruit, mango & fresh lychee! it's sweet without being too overcoming or saccharine - most likely because the lobster is super fresh. INCREDIBLE! PALATE CLEANSER: CHICLLED COCONUT SOUP: im usually not a fan of anything coconut that's not fresh (i grew up with coconut trees everywhere so im spoiled!) anyway, this had pineapple granite & organic yogurt sorbet. perfect to get you ready for dessert! HOT VALRHONA CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE: i have to say, the dessert isn't as spectacular as the entrees... don't get me wrong, this was great with vermont maple & vanilla ice cream - but i think my expectations were set up way too high w everything i had leading up to this point. MEYER LEMON TART: i love this! once again, something i usually never get for dessert but this came with other citrus fruits & i was really curious. im a big chocolate person but this sealed the deal for me. SERVICE: our servers were super nice, though a bit crazy hyper? his excitement doesn't really go well with the setting. maybe im just being crazy. PRICE: for everything, including two glasses of wine & a cocktail, the bill came out to around 260~ with tip. we didn't do the tasting menu but we'll definitely come back for that! xoxo",1
4677,490,5,2/12/2011,The entire dining experience was amazing. Â My husband and I came here for lunch and ordered the tasting menu. Â We were impressed by the amount of food we were given and were even more impressed by the attentive wait staff. Â Every item we ordered was delicious and the complimentary pound cake was a nice treat. Â We already made reservations to come back.,1
4678,490,5,2/3/2011,"Curiosity spurred me to *consider* making a reservation here but when I heard about the attractive price-point - $36 for five courses at an one-Michelin star restaurant - I was sold. What can I say? I'm a sucker for luxurious AND affordable dining experiences. I dined at Bouley on a cold, wet and typical New York winter afternoon. As soon as I push my way through the restaurant's heavy wooden door, my eyes are instantly drawn to an apple display covering the entire wall in front of me. The endless row of Royal Gala and Red Delicious apples (4,000 to be exact) punctures the air with a fresh, crisp aroma and is so intoxicating, it puts Glade to shame. I later learn Bouley's army of workers spend two hours each month replacing the apples to keep the display looking garden fresh. Pretty impressive, huh? AMUSE BOUCHE: My meal begins with a complimentary amuse bouche of a roasted pumpkin soup finished with toasted water chestnut, maple syrup and goat's milk ricotta. The pumpkin soup is full of flavor and simply delightful. The sweetness of the pumpkin, chestnut and maple syrup shines through and combines perfectly with the creamy texture of the ricotta (which, the server kindly points out, is imported from Italy). The toasted sliver of chestnut adds texture and brings the whole plate together. COMPLIMENTARY COURSE: As a foodie, nothing sets my heart racing more than the words, ""Compliments of the chef"" and that's exactly what this course is. The surprise dish - a sea urchin terrine with caviar and crÃ¨me fraiche - is delivered to my table straight from the kitchen and much to the jealousy of my fellow diners. Despite featuring thin slices of sea urchin encased in a geleed dashi stock, the dish is surprisingly light. The terrine encapsulates the smell of the ocean and the sea urchin is so fresh, it tastes like it's just been delivered from the Tsujiki fish markets in Tokyo. The creamy, velvety and almost avocado-like texture of the sea urchin contrasts beautifully with the fresh yuzu-infused crÃ¨me fraiche. The generous garnish of caviar, which bursts in your mouth, delivers another concentrated shot of the ocean while the basil oil adds color to the plate. RAW COURSE: Two small dishes and two bread rolls later, I finally get to the part of my meal that I'm actually paying for! My first course is a Chatham Blue Fin tuna with marinated Japanese turnip, spicy radish and yuzu-miso dressing. The dish is elegantly presented and is the epitome of a chef showing restraint. The magenta-colored fish is fresh and soft and undoubtedly, the star on the plate. Rather than dousing the tuna in a heavy cream-based sauce, the fish is accompanied with a light yuzu-miso dressing. The vinaigrette is a playful combination of salty, sweet and citrus flavors and balances perfectly with the tuna. The black sesame gelee adds a delicate yet nutty flavor, while the spicy radish and celery microgreens adds a subtle kick. SEAFOOD COURSE: My next course is one of Bouley's signature plates - the porcini flan with crab and black truffle - and is delivered to my table in a shallow porcelain dish with the lid still on top. The server instructs me to lift the lid at my leisure and once I perform the big reveal, I am floored by the heady aroma of the porcini mushrooms and black truffles. Words cannot describe how wonderful this dish smells and tastes. It really is in the mind blowing/orgasmic/amazing/(insert apt synonym here) realm. It features concentrated, complex flavors and is the perfect dish to cure seasonal affective disorder. Hearty chunks of dungeness crab and aromatic porcini mushrooms swim in a thick, gelatinous and earthy mushroom broth. The broth is seasoned to perfection and with each spoonful, I can feel my tastebuds dancing a little happy jig. The gloopy porcini custard, which I discover after performing an archaeological dig, is flavorful and ties the whole dish together. The sprinkling of chives also imbue a delicate onion flavor and adds another layer of flavor. MEAT COURSE WITH COMPLIMENTARY SIDE: After a much-needed 15 minute hiatus, my third course - the New Zealand white fallow venison with black truffle gnocchi - arrives. The gnocchi is soft, light and fluffy and imparts a robust black truffle flavor, while the venison (cooked to a perfect medium rare) is juicy and thick. The earthy notes of the gnocchi balances perfectly with the subtle five spice flavoring of the meat and the sweetness of the Pruneaux d'Agen. It is the first time I have ever tasted this French delicacy - prunes stuffed with plum pulp - and I'm blown away by it. The tiny morsel is literally heaven on a plate. The prune is firm on the outside but sweet, creamy and caramel-icious on the inside. The Brussel sprouts are slightly overcooked but given the successful execution of the other elements on the plate, it is only a minor infraction.

4679,490,2,1/29/2011,Soooo stuffy with terrible service. Â We went for the lunch special and while the courses were great cuisine it took nearly three hours to complete. Â They made us wait a half hour when we arrived and forgot about us between each course. Â Three hours of my life I will never get back.,1
4680,490,5,1/28/2011,"Wow - what an experience, and at $36 for the lunch tasting menu, what a total steal! Bouley is easily the fanciest restaurant I've ever ever been to. It is like a grand holdover - the servers hover in black suits, speaking gently to you about the specials with their most fabulous French accents. You feel sort of like you're dining in some society lady's dream of a Provencal French chateau in the middle of spring - it's almost too much, but then it just completely works. For $36 you have 4 courses, not including the amuse bouche and a lovely mid-meal palate cleanser. It is SO worth every little penny (and more!). Go! Eat! Now!",1
4681,490,5,1/22/2011,"As far as prix fixe lunches go, the one offered at Bouley is about as good as it gets. The $36 lunch prix fixe comes with five courses plus Amuse Bouche and Petit Fours, so it's a good deal considering the quality of the food being served. As far as the atmosphere is concerned, it really doesn't feel like you are dining at a restaurant. The main dining room has the feel of your wealthy aunt's living room, complete with lamp fixtures, antiques, and long couches adorned with fluffy pillows. Charming. As would be expected of a restaurant of its caliber, Bouley was filled with patrons who were considerably older than me or my dining partner. It appeared that most of the other tables consisted of businesspeople and older couples, so we felt a bit out of place, but whatever, we were here for some good food. Okay, so onto the food: Bread: During our meal, we were offered a mini Rosemary Baguette, Apple Raisin Bread, and Pistachio Bread. All of the breads were fresh and delicious, especially the Pistachio Bread, which came studded with sweet pistachios that contrasted nicely with the chewy crust and soft innards. Amuse Â Bouche: Spiced Pumpkin Soup with Creme Fraiche This wonderfully spiced soup tasted like autumn in liquid form. The spice blend actually reminded me a bit of curry. This was a great way to start the meal. First Course: Chatham Blue Fin Tuna, Marinated Japanese Turnip, Spicy Radish, Yuzu-Miso Dressing In my opinion, this was the low point of the entire meal. While it wasn't a bad dish, there just wasn't anything about it that made it memorable. It was straight-forward and clean, but nothing I'd come back to Bouley for. On the other hand... Second Course: Porcini Flan, Alaska Live Dungeness Crab, Black Truffle Dash This course is something I'd come back for again and again. It was served in a miniature pot and was brought to the table with its lid on. When the waitress removed the lid at the table, I was immediately hit with the strong aroma of black truffle. Upon my first taste, my brain instantly was like, ""OMG. GIVE ME MORE."" Seriously. The incredible earthiness emanating from the black truffles and Porcini mushrooms made for a killer broth, and the very generous serving of Dungeness crab was succulent. I even dug out a gooey glob of cheese, which added a sharp tanginess to the dish. Overall, this was a phenomenal dish, and if I had to recommend one dish from the entire meal, this would be it. GET IT. Third Course: New Zealand White Fallow Venison with Black Truffle Gnoocchi, Blue Kale, Brussels Sprout Leaves, Pruneaux D'Agen After the incredibleness that was the Porcini flan, it was almost inevitable that the next course would be a step down, but the venison was only a small step down. Although my piece was closer to medium than the advertised medium-rare, the meat was still really tender and juicy. This was a very good dish, but I think my mind was still lingering on the previous course. Fourth Course: Chilled Coconut Soup, Pineapple Granite, Organic Yogurt Sorbet This palate cleanser was really light and refreshing, which surprised me as I generally find coconut dishes a bit heavy. Dessert: Chocolate Frivolous - Chocolate Brulee, Chocolate Parfait, Hazlenut Daquoise, Chocolate Walnut Spice Bread, Valhorana Chocolate & Prune Armagnac Ice Creams While I felt the Porcini flan was the highlight of the meal, the Chocolate Frivolous was a close second. With essentially five portions of different chocolate desserts, the Chocolate Frivolous is truly a chocolate lover's dream. The Valhorana Chocolate ice cream was incredibly dark and rich, and it was soooo good. Like, lick the plate clean good. Like, pissed-off-at-the-fact-that-the-ice-cream-was-Â­served-on-a-plate-and-thus-harder-to-get-every-Â­last-drop good. The molten chocolate cake was another standout, as the dark, rich chocolate sauce enrobed the still-warm cake and oozed everywhere. Petit Fours: A great selection of cookies, chocolates, and candies was presented to us before we left. I was particularly fond of the toasted sesame candies, and even though my dining partner and I were a bit sugar overloaded from the Chocolate Frivolous, we still managed to clean off all of the items. While a five course lunch isn't something you would want to do everyday, Bouley's lunch prix fixe is definitely something worth trying. My personal favorites were the Porcini Flan and Chocolate Frivolous, but the whole meal was really quite tasty. So do your stomach a favor and stop by one day for lunch. You won't regret it.",1

4683,490,5,1/18/2011,"One cold, rainy day in January, while battling the puzzling climatic phenomena of ""wintry mix,"" we stumbled upon Bouley. What can I say? Entering the warm, impeccably decorated vestibule infused with the smell of ripe apples felt like being transported into another dimension. The lunch tasting menu turned one to be of the best meals I've Â had over lunch time. Ever! The porcini flan is a must, so is the venison. The chocolate desert was sinfully delicious, albeit a bit too much to have over lunch. The service was without a glitch - friendly, warm, and unobtrusive. At $36/person, this must be one of the best-kept lunch secrets in the city.",1
3932,490,5,1/17/2011,"This was my absolute best dining experience in New York and it was lunch! If you get the opportunity to have a leisurely lunch, this restaurant cannot be beat. It was $36 for a beautiful, delicious, six course meal. The Â mushroom flan is a must. My husband got it and I wanted to steal it from him. I got the skate, which was delicious, but that mushroom flan with crab meat is out of this world good. The meal ended with the most delicious chocolate dessert ever! Ever! They have an extraordinary wine list (least expensive bottles are around $65, so beware) and the service is outstanding. The ambiance is also incredible, unlike other New York restaurants where you are cramped, Bouley is spacious and comfortable. I can't wait to go back!",1
4684,490,5,1/15/2011,"Came to Bouley on New Years Eve with the girl...Made a rez for the early seating due to the fact it cost substantially less...At $150 for a 5-course tasting... Walked in and was absolutely floored by the decor...Was greeted by the hostess who was obviously French as well as about 3 other gentlemen, clearly french as well...They took or coats and had us sit for about 5 mins and then sat us at a table in the downstairs dining room...As we walked in we saw a 10-top eating away...I can't imagine that bill... Once we were sat we were greeted by a very nice fella who explained to us the menu for the evening as well as any other questions we had... Me and the GF basically decided we would split everything, that way we could get a taste of everything! Amuse Bouche: We were given a pumpkin soup that was very delicate and tasted of winter...Slight spice notes and subtle sweetness...Nice start to the meal... First Course: I started off with the Sea Urchin Terrine, Russian Oscetra Caviar, Creme Fraiche Vodka Dressing...Let's just say that this was one of the highlights of the evening for me...The sweet urchin was encased in a savory gelee'...The contrast of flavors was unbelievable....Wonderful flavors of the sea...So refreshing... Gf had the Big Eye Tuna and Hamachi plate...Fish was served raw, sliced thin...Fish was a fresh as can be...Was served with an asian vinaigrette and micro-greens...Pretty straight forward here... Second Course: I decided to do the $50.00 supplemental and splurge on the Foie Gras with Black Truffle, Champagne Gelee, Macadamia Nut Puree and Passion Fruit Powder...The Foie was served 2 ways...Seared as well as a mousse rolled in black truffles...Very, Very good is what I have to say...Loved the sauces that accompanied it... GF had the Farm Fresh CT Egg, Comte Foam, Steamed Polenta, Artichoke Puree...This was basically a poached egg on crack...The egg was cooked perfectly...Very tasty... Third Course: I had the New Zealand Venison, Black Truffle Gnocchi, Blue Kale, Brussel Sprouts...This was one of the most tender pieces of meats I have ever had...The Venison was sous-vide to a perfect medium rare...Generally I do NOT like lean cuts of meat...I am a rib-eye guy all the way! But I really appreciated how this was served...The gnocchi was very tasty and the sprouts were Delicious little morsels...I just wish there was alot more, because I could have eaten about 4 of thee plates by itself... GF had the Chatham Day Boat Lobster, Brown and White Honshimeji Mushrooms, Passion Fruit and Mango, Pomegranate Sauce...Holy S@#% was this amazing...Normally I find lobster to be one of the most overrated ingredients in all of cuisine...Buuuuuut David Bouley found a way to make me eat my words...The lobster was so tender and had so much flavor...Not because of the sauce, which was unreal by itself, but the lobster itself had a tremendous amount of flavor to it...Something I have never experienced while eating lobster in the past...Wow... Fourth Course, Palate Cleanser: Chilled Coconut Soup, Pineapple Granite, Organic Yogurt Sorbet...This stuff was so addicting...I happen to love coconut and pineapple so this was a pleasant surprise for me! It wasn't too sweet and was absolutely refreshing...Defintely paved the way for dessert! Fifth Course: For Dessert I had the Creme Brulee which is totally uncharacteristic of me considering I am a chocolate whore...Either way it was solid... Gf had the Chocolate Souflee' with a trio of ice cream...Vanilla, Chocolate and Prune Armagnac...Oh boy was this amazing...The souflee was warm and oozed of chocolate molten...The Prune Armagnac was my favorite of the ice creams...Just amazing... All-in-all, the GF and I had a wonderful and memorable experience for New Years Eve...The service was perfect and the food was great... Thank You Bouley... Joe",1
976,490,5,1/13/2011,"Seriously I can't keep up with YELP or places or people...so let's see if I can update one of my most favourite French restaurants in NY. I love this place...and I most definitely love their PORCINI FLAN. I can eat this for days! H and I love French food...it's our favourite cuisine! So of course I raved and raved about Bouley and how H must come here. H still hasn't been able to try this place, so I ended up taking H here - it is H's birthday after all. We both had the Porcini Flan and of course H thought it was amazing! The chef prepared this lobster dish for us...it was off the menu, but yes, the chef surprised us with this amazing dish. We both love lobster, so it was such a nice treat. I can't remember what else we had, but I remember the desserts were amazing and we couldn't stop eating. Service was excellent...once again! They even gave us a lemon loaf..one for each of us. We both love citrus too! So to sum this place up...it is freaking amazing and so is the service.",1
4685,490,5,1/9/2011,"OMG if you are looking for a delicious 5 course lunch or dinner you NEED to go here. All the chefs in the back freshly prepare your gourmet meal.

YUM! always going back here.",1
4686,490,5,1/8/2011,"The lady and I had a 10:30pm reservation, but was a little late because our flight into New York was delayed. Â However when we arrived, the Maitre d was very courteous and lead us to our table. Â From start to finish the people at Bouley made my girlfriend and I feel like a million bucks even though we did not buy the Prix Fixe dinner meal. Â For our meal we shared an appetizer, each had an entree (duck and lobster) and ordered a dessert. Â I won't go into the details of the meal as they were all fabulous and already described by others. Â But simply put it was to die for. Â  However what really made this experience delightful was the unexpected soup before the entire meal, the fluffy and flavorful mashed potatoes, and the pre-dessert which was not expected with our meals. Â After our entrees, we ordered one dessert, but to our delight they gave us a second dessert courtesy of the chef. Â  All the little intricacies of our meal were things I have never knew was possible in a dinner. Â As I've never had this type of service at an expensive upscale steakhouse or restaurant in Los Angeles/Orange County. Â There is a reason why this restaurant received a Michelin star, and I will say having eaten at other Michelin star restaurants, this place is a step above others in the same class. You gotta go here when you are in New York!",1
4687,490,5,1/4/2011,"The fella & I were spoiled to have Bouley as the beginning leg of our trip! Â All the meals thereafter (even though delicious in their own light) were competitively compared to our meal at Bouley. Â Due to a slight delay of our flight, we had rushed to our hotel to quickly change and rushed back out to Bouley. Â We arrived about ten minutes past our reservation, but luckily, just before the kitchen closed. Â Initially, we felt a bit rushed with the various servers that came by our tables. Â But once we placed our orders, everything was smooth sailing. Â We greatly appreciated the amazing and friendly service from the servers even after we had arrived a bit late. The ambiance of Bouley was very romantic with it's candlelit tables, Victorian like chairs, and small vases of fresh picked flowers. Â Upon entrance, you definitely feel like you're about to wine and dine! Â One very noticeable attribute at Bouley was at the entrance - there are rows and rows of fresh apples shelved on the walls of the entrance. Â This gave off a very refreshing scent of autumn apples on a cold Winter night. While deciding what to order for dinner, we were greeted by various servers for different items (one for wine, another for bread, etc). Â I highly recommend sampling both the pistachio bread and the one with a touch of anise. Â Both are tasty in their own ways! Â After glancing over the menu, the fella and I ordered the following: - North Carolina Pink Shrimp & Cape Cod Sea Scallops with Sweet Maine Princess Crab and Point Judith Calamari in an Ocean Herbal Broth: I'm a big fan of scallops, so when I saw this on the menu, I knew I had to give it a try! Â Each item was cooked to perfection - just enough to taste the sweet and succulent pieces by the bite. Â The shrimp even had a slight crunch! Â On top of the natural aroma and flavor of each seafood piece, the herbal broth further enhanced each piece. - Chatham Day Boat Lobster with Brown and White Honshimeji Mushrooms, Passion Fruit & Mango, Fresh Lychee, and Hyssop: My plump lobster was delectable! Â I wish I had a stronger palate to further distinguish all the flavors that played in this dish, but all I can say is that it was delicious! - Organic Long Island Duckling with Roasted with Truffle, Honey, Puree of Nevada Organic dates with Turnips, and Julienne of Local Beets: Medium rare duck will change your taste buds forever! I never knew you can have duck medium rare, but it's quite amazing! Â Moist and tender on the inside with a slight crisp on the outside, I almost wished that I had ordered the duck instead (and I'm not even a duck fan!) - Pineapple Carpaccio with Ten exotic fruit sorbet: This was a complimentary dessert from the chef. Â We had originally ordered the Hot Caramelized Anjou Pear with Valrhona Chocolate , Biscuit Breton, Hot Toffee Sauce with RÃ©glisse Sorbet and Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream. Â Both desserts were extremely tasty in their own way. Â The carpaccio is perfect if you're looking for a light, fresh type of dessert! On top of all the amazing dishes that we tried, we were served addition mini dishes between each course. Â Prior to starting our starter, the server brought out this amazing amuse bouche that tantalized my taste buds. Â A creamy pumpkin soup with a shy dollop of mascarpone cheese, I was left wanting more! Â The star side dish that accompanied our entrees was the puree mashed potatoes. Â I have NEVER had mash potatoes as creamy as the one at Bouley. Â It was so smooth and lump-less that it could almost be mistaken for butter!! Â On top of the soup and puree potatoes, we also received a pre-dessert to our desserts! Â A creamy coconut soup with a touch of mango sorbet danced on my tongue, leaving my sweet tooth almost content (ALMOST.) Â After we finished our carpaccio and caramelized pear, the fella & I were presented with MORE mini dessert treats! Â A tier of macaroons, chocolate covered mint chips, etc. teased my eyes and taste buds. Â Amazing! Â It was Christmas in my belly! If you're looking to be wined and dined, Bouley is the perfect gentlemen to do so!",1
4688,490,5,12/29/2010,"Apples! Â You enter into a room full of apples and it only gets better...that apple becomes the signature cocktail to start the meal. Â That cocktail turns into a bottle of white wine and a 5 course tasting menu....the food was inventive, excited, and cooked to perfection. Â The service was exceptional and the place wasn't even stuff, we got into a great conversation with the couple next to us which was a pleasure.",1
4689,490,5,12/19/2010,"Went for lunch while I was in NY and had an incredible experience.

4690,490,1,12/5/2010,"This place is nothing short of horrific. It symbolizes everything that is wrong with this world; incredibly overpriced food that is subpar and labeled as amazing simply because rich white people say it should be. It is one of the worst experiences I have ever encountered in my life. The staff feels like you owe them something and the chief is incredibly pretentious. I would recommend that you save your money and start a college fund because this exorbitant restaurant costs nothing less than a public education, however the taste of a big mac reigns supreme over the chiefs repulsive menu.",1
4691,490,5,12/2/2010,"Bouley was nothing short of amazing. Â The ambiance, the service, the food...an elegant dining experience that deserves its Michelin star rating.

Â  The breads were soft and warm: olive, raising, pistachio, flax seed baguette -- I think I tried them all and each one was as good as the previous. The amuse bouche was a spiced pumpkin soup with creme fraische that had so much flavor packed in a few small spoonfuls. Â It definitely served to whet my appetite. For the first course, I had the blue fin tuna that was soft and fresh, on top of a light yuzo-miso sauce. Â The sauce was so mild that it really allowed the fresh (quite large) pieces of tuna to stand out. Â Friends ordered the asparagus and said that it was delicious as well. Â  For the second course, I ordered the garlic and almond soup with parsley root and porcini mushrooms. Â The garlic soup was very very light, and not too creamy, but the almond creme fraische dollops added a bit of buttery flavor that was a nice surprise in each spoonful. Â There were a few slivers of the mushrooms, but for the most part, this was a very light dish. Â  One friend ordered the porcini flan and dungeness crab soup that had a ton of heavy flavors and a very hearty helping of dungeness crab in a small copper taureen of soup. Â Definitely concentrated richness and complex textures. Â Another friend ordered the salmon that she said was soft, moist, and delicious. My third course was the organic chicken with butternut squash ravioli. Â This was probably my favorite dish. Â The chicken was so juicy and tender and the squash ravioli was small but packed with a sweet kick that complemented the chicken beautifully. Â To top it off, there were Vermont chanterelles, and a light, creamy carrot & persimmon sauce. Before the dessert, there was a pre-dessert of a chilled coconut soup with passion fruit sorbet and a small sliver of grilled sweetened coconut granola on the bottom. Â The passion fruit was tangy and the citrus was nicely offset by the smooth, creamy coconut. Â By this point, I was already stuffed to the gills, but then... ...came the dessert. Â I wasn't sure what to expect with the ""chocolate frivolous,"" since the other portions were definitely not petite, but I certainly was not prepared for what I got. Â An entire plate filled with what seemed to be the entire menu of chocolate dishes at any other restaurant. Â On one plate, we had a dense, chocolate molten lava cake covered in chocolate sauce, a rich shot of chilled chocolate ganache, a scoop of hazelenut ice cream, a scoop of valharona chocolate ice cream, a cube of chocolate truffle and a parfait of hazlenut britton topped with a sheet of chocolate, topped with a mousse, topped with another sheet of chocolate. Â Six full-sized desserts on one plate. Â Unbelievable!! Â Everything was so decadent that I couldn't even finish, because I was all chocolate-d out. Â  On top of that, we got the standard petit fours tree. Â  OMG this was truly a luxurious meal that my calorie-counting cannot handle on a normal basis, but for a holiday extravagance, is not to be missed. Â What a fabulous time!",1
4692,490,5,12/1/2010,"Bouley is definitely on the same level as some of my favorites Eleven Madison Park, Gotham Bar and Grill, and Daniel. I settled on the tasting menu and they allowed me to make a few changes. I changed my first course and dessert and they did not blink an eye! It was designed to be 6 courses but after all the freebies and extras it turned out to be an 11 or so course feast. The service was impeccable and attention to detail amazing. They came around with 2 different bread baskets. The first included a delicious apple-walnut bread and baguette (which I don't like) from Bouley Bakery while I looked at the menu. Then after my amuse they came around with three more - pistachio, raisin, and sourdough. Here is what I ate and yes every single course was absolutely spectacular. The tasting menu portions were very very generous and I left feeling very satisfied, if not even a little over full. They started me off with a pumpkin soup that had a ricotta crema and chestnut. This was fall in a bowl. I usually don't get hyped up about amuses but this was great. Porcini Flan, Alaska Live Dungeness Crab, Black Truffle Dashi- There had to be about a half pound of crab in this ""little"" pot. I do not know what the regular size is but if this was any indication it must have a pound of crabmeat in it. The broth was sinfully awesome. Chatham Day Boat Lobster Brown and White Honshimeji Mushrooms, Fresh Passion Fruit & Mango, Fresh Lychee, Hyssop- Wonderful lobster and the sauces were a great compliment. Again a very nice portion size which I was grateful for. Definitely not stingy with lobster meat- nice tail and big claw. Live Sea Scallops & Nantucket Bay Scallops Prepared in a Tandori Manner, with Spices Imported from a Friend's Spice Shop in Paris, Local Curried Cauliflower Puree- This was the lightest course with 3 little scallops and one large one. The spice was a very nice tough. Although this was my least favorite, the dish was executed nicely. Organic Long Island Duckling Roasted with Truffle Honey, Puree of Nevada Organic dates with Turnips, Julienne of Local Beets- This was a knockout of a dish. Perfectly cooked rare duck and nice crispy crunchy skin on it. The truffle honey sauce was incredible as I love the balance between the saltiness of duck and sweetness of sauce. Coconut soup with Pineapple granite and Yogurt sorbet- This was a pre-dessert but omg it may have been the best thing I ate all night! You would think this would be an after thought but I could have had five more. It was like the best pina colada I have ever had. The coconut soup, pineapple, and the sorbet were perfection personified. Amaretto Flan Caramelized Banana, White Coffee Mousse Amaretto and Vermont Maple Ice Creams- I subbed this because I didn't want to try the ubiquitous molten chocolate cake and I was not disappointed. I LOVE Amaretto and this was so delicious. The ""flan"" was like a 4 inch rectangule of amaretto custard and the tablespoon of bananas paired with the delicious quenelles of ice cream were perfect. As if that were not enough they gave me a complimentary dessert also which I could not finish. At this point I was bursting. Oh yeah and the petit fours tower too. So many treats and so delicious. Loved the atmosphere and the service was great without being intrusive. Overall, when putting it all together Bouley delivers the whole package- Food, Ambience, Service. I loved it and will definitely be back again.. and again.. and...yes again.",1
2920,490,4,11/30/2010,"came here for my birthday dinner with two other friends. Â we brought down the average dining age by 50%... but it was cozy (even though the restaurant is huge and never-ending it seems) and not pretentious or snooty at all - very countryside / victorian decor with plush velvet curtains and couches and old fashioned flower wallpaper covering the walls, random quirky golden animals or fruit adorning the lamps or chandeliers. it's what i would imagine the parlor of a cute, old but very wealthy blue-haired grandma would look like Service was very kind and polite, and they even gave us a beautiful chocolate dessert plate with a candle for my birthday. Â The only con was the timing was a bit off, we waited about 30 minutes in between our 2nd and 3rd course... no one apologized for the wait so I wasn't sure if that was considered normal...? all the dishes we had were amazing, except for the 3rd course - all the options were okay but it wasn't as jaw-dropping spectacular as the rest. for that reason i'd probably go a la carte next time we went for the tasting menu (5 courses for $125, each course there are about 3 dish options) - my absolute favorites were the Porcini Flan with Dungeness Crab and Black Truffle Dashi, Fresh Malibu Sea Urchin Terrine with Russian Golden Oscetra Caviar (I have never had sea urchin like this before!! was incredible). Â The rack of Lamb melted in my mouth it was so savory and smooth. My friends got the Grouse special which was a unique dish to try. Â Also found the apple bread with raisins addicting...",1
4693,490,5,11/30/2010,"Went for the $36 pre-fixed lunch on Saturday, perhaps the most amazing deal on food in the city. The decor and setting is fancy, from the apple perfumed lobby to the velour chairs. The service is impeccable, as you might expect in a Michelin Star rated restaurant. The presentations are magnificent, the food inventive, and the overall experience is fun. While we got away with jeans, we stuck out. We couldn't have gotten away with it for dinner. Next time, I would show more respect and dress properly. I started with blue fin tuna which was fresh. I indulged in salmon, venison, terriffic breads, a lovely amuse bousch, a refreshing palate cleanser and and terriffic pear dessert. We were all dumbfounded. There were picky eaters in the group that did just fine. The bill was $200 (no alcohol) for lunch for 4 people. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable foodie experience. This lunch may be the best kept secret in New York. Bravo!",1
4694,490,4,11/28/2010,"bouley is delightful and quite the experience. my roomie had been raving about Bouley in tribeca for quite some time now. we finally went today, along w/2 other gfs for an official saturday lunch celebrating our fabulosity. the service is top notch, the food is exquisite, and the ambience is romantic, like a monet painting. not all too familiar w/french cuisine, but the Bouley lunch tasting menu is definite the way to go. 4 courses total (amuse bouche/ app/ entree/dessert) - the food is delicate and thoughtful in flavor. $36. i got the following: tuna app - tuna was so fresh w/the yuzu sauce porcini flan - FAVE DISH. crab, flan, and truffle dash? im sooo game. chicken entree - i think the salmon dish that my gfs got was better, as chicken was anti-climatic. dessert - anjou pear tart. by this time, i was stuffed, but tart was good. we also ate the complimentary assortment of breads intermittently, along w/savory and sweet gaspachos to clean the palate in b/w plates. vibe was a bit stuffy and older demographic (we are late 20s/early 30s). sidenote: BEST apple martini i've ever had in my life. PERIOD.",1
4695,490,5,11/17/2010,"I love tasting menus, and I've tried a fair number of places, This place is by far the best. Although quite pricey (440 for 2, including tip), it is still cheaper than some of the upper scale tasting menus (i.e. French Laundry). At first, before my whole dining experiance, people from the restaraunt called me to see if there was a special occasion, and to confirm my reservations. When we got to the restaraunt, we were greeted very warmly by someone at the front door to take our coats. The decor inside the restaraunt is very grand and very french. They had seatings which were coaches, perfect for romatic dinners, where the couple can snuggle up while eating dinner. They also have formal 4 seater settings, if you go for a business dinner. The menu has alacarte, but we had the tasting menu. We had the one with wine pairing. The amount of wine they pour you per glass is very genoros, and if you happen to drink a lot before your next course comes, they will refill it for you. The tasting menu was delicious, with a chilled soup to start with, a raw seafood dish, a cooked seafood dish, a meat dish, dessert and petit fours. My dad usually does not get full on taster menus, but he was definaely bloated at the end of dinner. We had to pack our petit fours home, which I ate the next day, and they were still DELICIOUS. Â  When we left, they also gave us a little souvenir, Lemon tea cake, to bring home, which needless say was just as good as the rest of the meal. My dad said it was one of the best meals he has had in the US, and he comes visit a lot. It is definitely up there in my list too. Would love to come here again!!! Definitely worth the money.",1
4696,490,4,11/16/2010,The Bad - Nothing in particular...ordered to pre fixe lunch The Good - Organic Beefsteak Heirloom Tomato - Chocolate Frivolous - Some chicken entrees - Dessert!!! Many different types of chocolate - Free creme brulee (yummy) The Bottomline- Definitely worth checking out their pre fixe menu. Awesome choices and affordable prices. They have complimentary soup at the beginning and different breads for you to try as they walk around.,1
4697,490,5,11/10/2010,This lovely restaurant was everything I expected and much more. The food was absolutely delectable and the employees were extremely helpful and did everything they could to make our meal absolutely wonderful. I think that you should take the advice of your waitress and do the wine pairing - AMAZING! Enjoy.,1
4698,490,5,11/8/2010,"Did the 6 course tasting menu..bubbles, wine and 6 courses of incredible food! Â The vibe at the restaurant was just awesome. Â Hard to explain, so go check it out! Â =) Â  I can't wait to go back again! Â Thanks, Charlotte, for the recommendation!",1
4699,490,5,11/7/2010,"I took my fiance here last night for his birthday and he and I were both pleasantly surprised not only when arriving, but when leaving as well. We were welcomed warmly by every server we passed on our way to our table, which I appreciated. Â  We both had the 6 course tasting menu. 1st course - I had the tuna which was excellent, he had the sea urchin which he is still talking about 2nd course - I had the salmon - it was great, but probably my least favorite of the evening - he had the crab (although he meant to get the lobster) - probably his least favorite of the evening 3rd course - I had the Hamachi, which I enjoyed very much - he had the shrimp, which we both enjoyed more than the Hamachi 4th course - I had the lamb - which was so perfect I swear I was eating steak, it melted in my mouth. Â He had the venison (which replaced the steak for the evening), which also was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. Â This came with black truffle gnocchi which was heavenly! 5th course - palate cleanser - light, and perfectly simple 6th course - I had the chocolate souffle - I had to put my spoon down after the first bite because it was literally THAT good. Â He had the pear - which was delicious and loaded with flavors. *Between course 1 and 2, we were actually waiting a bit before the 2nd course came out - so the staff brought us champagne and sent out another dish before the 2nd course came. Â It was oysters, slightly different than the one on the menu. Â This was a great touch and really made us forget that we had been waiting for our 2nd for a few minutes too long. Â It proved to us they were attentive and aware of the amount of time between the courses. We had told our server when we ordered our meal that it was my fiance's birthday and with dessert came a large plate filled with different chocolate desserts - each one better than the next. Â Sadly we were both so full at that point that we could not enjoy them all as much as we would have liked. In addition to the chocolate dessert plate, they also gave us a dessert wine to enjoy, which was surprisingly very good (I do not like sweet wines). Of course in between the courses, breads and other little fixings were offered to us and all were great. Â  Overall, I felt Bouley did not miss a beat and really were there to serve us and make us happy. Little notes - they offer extra little drinks to each table, so if you want to drink more but not spend the money on a bottle - I suggest ordering by the glass because from what we observed last night, they offer each table at least two or three glasses of comped wine/champagne. Go the bathroom! Â It was beautiful and something to see. Ask for two apple, raisin breads and leave the other roll in the basket - that little thing was great!",1
4700,490,5,11/5/2010,"As a birthday treat for myself, I booked a lunch at Bouley one balmy Saturday afternoon. As a single diner, I don't know if they paid special attention to me, but I unexpectedly got one of the best dining experiences in my life. I knew that I was going to try the $36 lunch prixe fixe special. It is listed as a three-course online, but I received four official courses when ordering. In addition, I received so many little complimentary items that after all was said and done, I had been presented with 9 total dishes! - Amuse bouche - a refreshing cold gazpacho with a small scoop of basil sorbet. The broth was light and not too sweet, and the herby-coldness of the sorbet definitely 'amused' my palate. - Appetizer - blue fin tuna, prepared sashimi style. The fish was fresh, and an Asian flair was added with some pickled turnips, and a yuzu-based sauce on the plate. - Complimentary course - at this point, the waitress placed something unexpected in front of me. A quivering tan square set the stage, with little orange mounds dotted along the top. ""Gift from the kitchen"", she said. Oh MY. This was a dish that Ruth Reichl raved about in her blog as 'almost unbearably delicious': entire tongues of sea urchin, suspended in a dashi gelee. A small pool of creme fraiche lined the bottom, garnished with a scoop of caviar. This is the complimentary course?! I was floored; the dish was briny and sweet, and so very rich. - Fish course - At this point, I'm starting to wonder if I'll be able to eat the entire meal. And then a little copper bowl was brought to me. The scent of mushrooms filled the air. The porcini flan with crab and truffle dashi broth is the ultimate comfort food; warm, enveloping your senses with a heady scent, the crab providing a small textural contrast and some sweetness. I was suffering from a lingering cold that day, and this is the dish that soothed my sinus and made me feel nice and warm inside. - Meat course - Duck, accompanied by slices of beets and grapes. This dish was blessedly not overcooked, and I very much enjoyed the pairing with the sweet grapes. A small bowl of whipped potatoes was also brought out separately. As much as I tried to stay away from this starchy filler, the buttery smoothness brought me back bite after bite. - Palate cleanser - strawberry rhubarb granite topped with olive oil ice cream. I enjoyed the tartness of this dish, and definitely felt as if it prepared me for more sweet things to come. - Dessert course - Warm pear tart, paired with two ice creams. I love pear-themed desserts. Especially when it's warm, and comes with a flaky pastry base smeared with a little chocolate. I thought the rosermary ice cream was a little too overwhelming, but the vanilla was perfect. - Complimentary course - ""You can't leave here before trying our creme brulee!"" my waitress exclaimed. Bless her heart. I was incredibly full now, but managed to take two bites. The caramelized top crackled enticingly on my spoon, and the custard underneath was velvety and chock full of vanilla flavor. I look at the dessert wistfully, while my stomach groaned. - Mignardises - You mean there's MORE??!? A gleaming silver tower is whisked onto my table. Delicate little cookies and chocolates beckoned... I waved the white flag. With nary a strange look in my direction, the waitstaff quickly packed it up into a little takeout box for me. Service was prompt and polite, and just friendly enough to not seem intrusive. The room was classically beautiful. And although I don't know if all the complimentary dishes are just always offered, I greatly enjoyed and appreciated them. What a steal; great food, and a great experience for $36.",1
4701,490,2,11/3/2010,the food is good but not the best french in the CITY also i got super turned off when i saw a mouse run across the floor,1
4702,490,5,11/1/2010,"Lovely place to have a romantic dinner. Â I loved the old space with the wall of Apples in the entryway. Â The new location is growing on me although it feels a bit more ""trendy-ish"" Â The service is top notch. Â superior wine list. No question its one of the places to go if you want a great meal.",1
4703,490,5,10/27/2010,"My dining nirvana began upon entering the restaurant. It is an impressive, classy dining room with all manners of little endearing details, such as floral arrangements and a little squash gourd on each table. I ordered the prix-fixe lunch, and was elevated by the aromas and tastes of each dish. Like the changing of the guards, every plate came with the changing of the highly polished proper silverware. They served freshly baked bread from their bakery and I couldn't resist the saffron-walnut bread, which had the slightest hint of sweetness. I savored the signature appetizer, a very generous dungeness crab and porcini flan with a truffle dashi salt. Â My table staff were very but not annoyingly attentive and friendly. This has renewed my love affair with the Bouley brand.",1
4704,490,5,10/25/2010,"*********** Review 299 ************* Â  Â  Â  Â I took my best friend here, another Michelin Star, for our BDAY continue celebration with food & wine all OCT month. First walked in, shelves from floor to ceiling fill up with fresh apples, my best friend couldn't hold herself together, she grabbed 1 & ate it! Â  Â  Â  Â Bouley is so beautiful, definitely classic French style, as I walked in a castle, pastel paintings & designs on the walls, so romantic, & so charming. Â Walking through another dining room, fresh flowers, wooden tables, opo, squashes, pumpkins displayed through out the restaurant, make me feel so Fall, my FAV season!, because it's our Birth month! Â  Â  Â  We got a table in the very back dining room, so romantic, wish I was with a gentleman, that would be nicer, instead of my loud & obnoxious BFF ;-) haha! Oh I have to come back soon for that ;-) Â  Â  Â  Â The gracious Johana came out & explained the menu to us. Then Sergey suggested us some wine pairing with our tasting menu. Service was excellent, so on point, quick and just enough time between the courses. I love how they both explained to us when each course arrive. Later, Sergey toured us the restaurant, and the ladies room, I was amazed! All burgundy velvet floor to ceiling, couches & chairs in purple & gold, it was like a nice lounge. I didn't want to leave! What we ordered: APPETIZERS & ENTREES: - Tomato chilled soup - so refreshing! - Organic Beefsteak heirloom tomato with Robiolina, tomato coulis, raspberry vinegar, orange powder, ""Le Blanc"" almond oil dressing - so sweet, so refreshing. I got my heirloom tomato in my garden that my BFF planted for me, but there likes more than thousands types of tomatoes, I always like to try new ones at fine resto like Bouley. - Chatham Blue Fin Tuna - marinated Japanese turnip, spicy radish, Yuzu-Miso dressing - such a nice dish & well dressing. - Cape Cod Skate steamed with exotic fruit bribiche, fresh lychee, mango, papaya, capers, homemade pickles, passion fruit, kumquat purÃ©e. This was so flavorful, furity, sweet, tangy, all together in every single bite. - Porcini Flan, Alaska Live Dungeness Crab - Blakc truffle Dashi - plenty of crab meat in this sweetness broth, the truffles were floating & every scoop I tasted the aroma was beyond words. Came in a copper mini pot, so adorable. My favorite dish at Bouley for sure. - All-Natural Pennsylvania Chicken - blue Kate and black truffle gnocci, Vermont chanterelles, Dijon, fresh spring chive and hyssop sauce. This was a big portion, the meat was so tender, the sauce was fantastic. - Long Island Duckling Glazed with Reglise - Organic white beets, first of the season Finger Lake grapes, Candic, Himrod, and Champagne. This was a divide dish. The meat was juicy, just pink inside, perfectly cooked. DESSERTS: - Chilled local strawberry soup with cherry tomato and strawberry granite, Greek olive oil ice cream - Â tasty, creamy but not sweet at all. - Chocolate Frivolous: Chocolate BrulÃ©e, chocolate parfait, Hazelnut Dacquoise, chocolate walnut spice bread, white coffee ice cream, prune Armagnac ice cream - Â wow, if you are a chocolate lover, this is HEAVEN on EARTH for you dish! - Selection of French, Italian and Domestic Cheeses - served with toast - delish! - Pineapple sorbet - refreshing. - Petite Fours - 3 tiers of happiness treats! WINES: - Champagne by the glass. - 2006 Chateau Mont-Redon Chateauneuf-du-Pape - young wine, tannin, acidity, exotic spices taste. - La Tour Vieille Banyuls Reserva - smooth, brerry fruity, deep note. - 2005 ChÃ¢teau Tirecul La Graviere Monbazillac Les Pins - nice & smooth. light nose, well balance, fruity, very clean taste. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Wine list was notable, also plenty of by the glasses for you to choose from. Chef David Bouley food was French with a twist of Japanese influence, freshest ingredients from local & around the world, for such a a fraction of other Michelin Star restos that I've been to so far. By far, this was the most value Michelin Star meal I had all trip in Manhattan. On our way out, the hostess gave us the Tea Cake to go, how sweet is it? Unbelievable, I have to bring my parents here soon! Overall: 5 stars For value: 5 stars For Food: 5 stars For Service: 5 stars For ambiance: 5 stars Location: Tribecca",1
4705,490,5,10/24/2010,"I went here with 3 other people on a friday afternoon for their $36 6-course lunch-special. Bottom-line: the food was outstanding from start to finish! I especially want to highlight the exquisite Scottish salmon that was served on a pineapple sauce with corn, absolutely delishous and the fish was so fresh! The natural chicken was also fantasticly tender and delicious... One of the most memorable things though, has to be the dessert: a plate filled with lava cake, mousse, ice cream, nougat... the chocolate lava cake was still warm and just melting in your mouth. There was an amazing rosemary icecream which was just very unique and tasty. The chocolate mousse was also a big favorite at our table. Overall, the food was so good, I give Bouley 5 stars even though we were somewhat dissapointed in the waiters... A glass of white wine was late so it did not arrive at the table until we were done with the fish. We were asked if we wanted coffee with the dessert and ordered two coffee and two tea, however, this never came but was still put on our check. Obviously this is not good service, but the food really makes up for that, I def recommend this great restaurant! And PS dress up! I was not particularly dressed up and everyone else were in business attire",1
4706,490,4,10/24/2010,"Going to Bouley for the prix fix lunch with a group of 6 was the cherry on the sundae that was my birthday weekend of surprises. Â My beau brought me as the final step to my bday celebration and it was a truly luxurious experience. The dining room was rather hushed and so our typically boisterous group did take a second to adapt to the new environs. Â Once we were in our comfy high backed chairs and they brought out some scrumptious gazpacho, we all settled into the experience. Â The food was great, and the pace of the meal was perfect. Â A highly civilized time was had by all. Also, the foyer was an apple room. A room litterally lined with real apples on every bit of wall space. Â It smelled amazing and got us all feeling the specialness that was to come. I would definitely recommend for anyone looking to impress their g/f or b/f on a special occasion.",1
4707,490,2,10/17/2010,"There was nothing wrong with the food. In fact, some dishes were delicious, and I particularly enjoyed truffle-inspired courses. The service left a lot to be desired however. If I'm going to spend 400 dollars in a meal to treat my husband for his birthday I expect to be treated, not like royalty, but certainly with deference. We were seated at the private room downstairs and even if that was fine (the room was intimate), we soon discovered that we were second class citizens. It took 40 minutes to get our menus and another 20 min more to get our order. Even when it was clear that I was upset, Â the waiter never apologized. It is really sad to see how such beautiful food is served in such poorly manner. To be clear, the sommelier and the other members of the staff were very nice and attentive. Our negative experience stems from our primary waiter who neglected his responsibilities. This should not be allowed in a place like Bouley.",1
4708,490,5,10/3/2010,Bouley is still one of my favorite restaurants. Â The atmosphere is sophisticated and romantic. Â Perfect for a date. Â  Our waiter told us that David Bouley himself was in the kitchen overseeing the food. Â  We did the tasting menu and everything was perfect. Note: people usually dress a little bit nicer here. Â I wore jeans and a blazer and I was the most dressed down person.,1
4709,490,1,9/26/2010,"Dreadful. Â Dinner at Bouley was the worst dining experience I have had in NYC. Â It took over 30 minutes past our reservation time to be seated, during which we were not offered drinks and when we requested a cocktail it took over 15 minutes to actually bring one. Â This was merely the beginning; after being seated the service was so bad it was surreal. Â We begain looking for Ashton Kutcher to pop out and tell us we were on punked. Â It was a parade of amateur circus clowns, from the waiter who showed up to take our order and never came back, the bread lady who, rather than offering choices as was customary merely tossed bread on our plates from a distance and told us what we would eat, a sommelier who never showed up to take our order and being told a dish that had run out, but mysteriously showed up after the chef arrived off a plane with fresh codfish in his luggage (seriously?). Â  The food was merely ok, while the shrimp and scollop appetizer was tasty, the oysters were fishy and a few pieces of duck scattered around a plate was mediocre at best. Â Certainly not worth being insulted by waitstaff and hostesses or made to wait for eternity. Â Chef Bouley may want to get back to basics and start running a real flagship operation rather than trying to build a ""culinary empire"" in Tribeca. Â In the meantime, skip Bouley and stick with Corton, Daniel or 11 Madison Park.",1

4712,490,4,8/30/2010,"Walked into Bouley and was greeted with nice waiters that led us to our seats. Very classy - I liked how they pushed in the chair so that I could sit. Pros: - Good Service: Waiters constantly came by to our table to ask us if we wanted bread. - had free desserts - compliments from the chef - Beautiful Decor: The Women's Bathroom was especially cool and modern/chic. - Beautiful Presentation of the Food Cons: - Too much ""TOMATO"" desserts. I don't know if it's a french thing but almost every dish I ate had some sort of tomato in it. I like tomatoes but it got kind of repetitive. - Expensive Things you should try: - Pear Anjou Dessert (I thought this was better than the chocolate desserts platter they offered. It was just too chocolaty for me. Especially the souffle. ) - Asparagus Appetizer - Sweets on a tiered platter (given to you at the end of the meal) - Creme Brulee was good (loved the crunchy texture on the top) * Funny Thing about the tomatoes. My friends and I got a free dessert in the beginning - something with watermelons and tomatoes. Then unknowingly I ordered Steak Tomatoes for Appetizer. I actually thought it was Steak and Tomatoes but it was just the name of the tomatoes. Total: 2 Tomato Dishes. Later on in the $36 Lunch Tasting Menu we had a Tomato Strawberry Dessert. It was quite good - better than the other two but that was a total of 3 Tomato dishes I had.",1

Â It's not just because of my Imam ex, or the fact that I'm the treasurer of the Not Without My Daughter fan club (fyi sorry members, there won't be a conference this year because the IRS froze my accounts), but the true reason I'm pro-mosque is because I heard on the radio that if the Muslims are not allowed to build at ground zero, they will pull all hummus and pita bread from our grocery stores. This CANNOT happen. I don't like to protest in the street, for fear that someone might mistake me for being poor or homeless. Â Instead, I decided to protest at one of the whitest, most bougie places in the city. Â Bouley. I arrived at Bouley promptly at 9:30 PM, waltzing into their little foyer with skin-tight jeans and a Cavalli top. Â I'm not talking about a shirt, straight people, I mean that the TOP I was with was dressed entirely in Cavalli. Â Tacky, I know, but he was Eurotrash and he was gonna foot the bill. Â You think I could afford Bouley on my own?! The first room you enter when walking into Bouley is filled with rows and rows of apples, which releases the fine smell of...apples...into the air. Â Snow White would have a field day. Â FYI, there's no one watching this room, so if you ever need some free produce, just run in and grab a few. Â No one cares. Â I mean hEllO, it's Tribeca. So we sat down, blah blah, and I of course ordered the most expensive thing on the menu... the tasting, which consisted of 4 regular courses, plus a strawberry soup and dessert. Â I know what you're thinking: why would Fulgencio order all this food if he doesn't eat? Â Good question. Â I'd gotten so high off the overwhelming scent of apples in the foyer that I had no clue what was going on... OR why my Eurotrash date still hadn't removed his ruby red sunglasses, even though we were indoors and in a jacket-required high-dining scene. Â He looked like Cyclops from the X-Men, only this one's from Belarus, and the only reason his eyes light up is because he did too much coke the night before. So now's the most painful part of the review where I actually have to talk about what I ate. Â Oh God, for an anorexic, this is the worst. Â It must be like when they ask Lindsay Lohan what she did last night. First of all, the food is amazing. Â Unless you have the palate of a caveman, then you'll love it. Â The meal started with a perfect gazpacho, and before you knew it the chef was knocking out dishes like a professional boxer. Â Each dish was literally like a punch in my face, except for the dessert, which was more of an ear bite-off. Â No clue why the chef had to get all Mike Tyson in the last round. Â Whateva, it's all good. Highlights? Â I don't know even know what that word means... all I know is it was the name of a kids magazine in my old barber shop, and I used to do the puzzles on page 5. Â But I'll tell you what dishes were best. Â The duckling rocked, and the scallop dish with the tomato flavor was pure genius. Â The hamachi was also noteworthy. Â And at the end of the meal, the kitchen served three desserts, one of which wasn't even on the menu, along with a petit four that was more of a petit sixteen. While I was ignoring my date, who was talking about designer jean-shopping in his hometown of Bucharest (wherever that is...), one of the managers graciously approached our table and asked us if we were enjoying our dinner. Â I said I'd enjoy it even more if the hot latin busboy gave me his #. Â The manager thought I was kidding. By the time my many-course dinner was over, most of the restaurant had emptied out. Â There was no one left to protest to about the mosque. Â Really, the only thing to protest was that my Eurotrash companion wanted me to crash at his hotel. Â Luckily for him, I'd gotten drunk off a bottle of Martinelli zin and my wine-o goggles made him look much more like Marc Anthony than Silvio Berlusconi. If you want the continuation of my mosque story, go see my review of Aureole. Â Or just go straight to Bouley and enjoy one of the best meals of your life. This has been a Review by Fulgencio",1
1096,490,3,8/24/2010,"The $36 lunch tasting menu was installed at Bouley shortly after Bouley Bakery and Bouley Market closed down due to low marginal profits, when David started re-working his whole gameplan. Rumors are he's concentrating his efforts on opening something where Secession and Danube once were, so I'm not sure if this 6-course lunch is just a means to rake in some income before the next big thing. At Bouley, the French-New American cuisine is clean, simple, and elegant. No gimmicky foams or liquified tarts. Which brings me to why the lunch tasting menu was a little disappointing: Most of the items were too simple. I would have taken 3 outstanding courses over 6 meh courses any day. Â The chicken with black truffle gnocchi and a side of fingerling potato puree was so utterly straightforward that I was kind of suprised it was being served at such a highly-touted restaurant. I think I would have rated Bouley 4 stars had it not been for this boring piece of rubbery chicken (the duck, on the other hand, was much tastier). More items, in order from worst to best: the tuna, the flan, the skate. The big eye tuna sashimi was basically sliced fish over a lemon sauce. While the lemon terrine was very visible and flavorful underneath the sashimi, I'm not sure why the cucumber and radish were even emphasized on the menu as I barely knew they were there. I'd be interested to know if this is Pacific or Atlantic big eye tuna as I believe one or the other is very overfished. The porcini flan was a little salty, but the meaty pieces of crab were savory enough for you to want to keep digging your spoon back into the copper pot. And the skate was my lunch experience's saving grace. This is the only course where the dish seemed simple and unpretentious, but a few bites truly brought out the underlying complexity and thoughtfulness that went into preparing it. Really liked the granitÃ© and olive oil sorbet (again, well-calculated). This was, lastly, followed by a bombarding of chocolate in the chocolate frivolous, a delicious caramelized pear, and various petit fours. While dessert was freaking awesome, it was also kind of sad given that the high point of a meal here shouldn't be it's final note; I wanted to be wowed throughout the entire tasting menu. My date, also, barely mouthed a ""omg WOW"" save for the breads, the skate, and the dessert. A small note: The items on the Spring lunch tasting menu are almost identical to the Summer lunch tasting menu but for a few changes. Current website menus are incorrect. Maybe this review of an entire restaurant is a litte unfair as I only had the tasting menu at lunch, whereas the dinner tasting menu seems to be much more elaborate. My experience was okay and the service was very good. Â $36 is great deal to draw people in, but, unfortunately, it should not be an excuse for average-level food at what should be a superior establishment.",1
4714,490,4,8/23/2010,I have to say that I was very pleased with Bouley. I thought that food was great and service to match. I liked the dÃ©cor however my girl thought it could have been better. We are both interior designers and sometimes don't see eye to eye. The crab and truffle soup might be one of the best things I have ever eaten. I hear good things about the pre-fix lunch but I have yet to try it. Pros: Great food Friendly service Nice wine list Warm dÃ©cor Cons: Can be high in cost,1
4715,490,5,8/21/2010,"A stunning meal. I came for the lunch tasting menu and it was divine. For a mere $40 I enjoyed 4 courses here. The website is not an accurate representation of the menu so don't plan anything by that. For my particular tastes every course was delicious. Usually in any tasting menu there would be at least one dish I really don't care for but every dish was a hit. The Dungeness Crab was savory, sweet and delicious. The Long Island Duck was tender and flavorful. The creme brulee was creamy and lovely. I was also pleasantly surprised to find the cocktails were also quite good. A truly magnificent meal. I have had lunch at Jean George and other fine places and this was much better. Service was spot on and quite good. I adored the food and eagerly await dining here again.",1
4716,490,5,8/13/2010,"My family took me here for my birthday for lunch and I have to say, best French I have had (many of you may disagree?). While I find it hard to remember the names of the dishes and the ingredients that go into them, this place is one of the top of the top. Â Since I have been there once, I recommend the only thing I have had there, the $36 prefix lunch. The prefix lunch is a 5 course meal, with customer preferences on four of the courses. Â They offer a nice selection and I have say the following things stood out: 1) The progression to the meal in terms of palette, style, richness, and presentation all flowed very nicely together. Â They even give you a type of melon sherbet/light tomato puree type soup to begin the meal before the first course. 2) The service is impeccable. Â The dishes presented and dishes taken away are timed by both waiters and the bread basket is always around with a nice little selection of light bread. 3) Even though the staff doesn't smile usually (when they're waiting around), when they deal with customers, they always have smiles on their faces. Â This is quite important because it contributes to the overall atmosphere. 4) Plan to stay there for 3 hours (like most fine dining French places). Â The food is prepared carefully and the presentation is great. The wait is very well worth it. 5) If you are into fine dining decor, this place feels like a small room within a crazy mansion. Â It is set-up with lavish interior pieces and all kinds of art around the walls. Â It feels like you have stepped into a room that's designed like a living room of a mansion but with dining tables and lavish couches for seats subbed in. I would definitely go back for more, even with the price tag. Â That kind of service and food deserves the wait and the price attached with it.",1
4717,490,4,8/11/2010,"I recently had the Spring Lunch Menu at Bouley. Â For $36, you get four courses and various extras. Â I had passed by the restaurant numerous times, but it always looked a little too fancy for lil' old me. Â But if I can handle the prix fixe, so can you. We were first presented with an amuse bouche of gazpacho with cucumber/celery sorbet. I love for savory sorbets, and this one didn't disappoint - it was light, refreshing and complemented the gazpacho nicely. For my first course, I had the South of France Jumbo White Asparagus with Roasted Local Pencil Asparagus, Spring Garden Herbs, Basil Dressing In a ComtÃ© Cloud. Â If there's one way I like to eat vegetables, it's covered in cheese, on top of cheese and crusted with cheese (for good measure). Â But seriously folks, the asparagus was perfectly done, not too overcooked or soggy. Â The comtÃ© clouds were mmm' mmm' good - soft custard pillows of the mild and sweet cow's milk cheese. Another first course option was the Sashimi Quality Big Eye Tuna with Marinated Cucumber, Spicy Radish, Yuzu-Miso Dressing and Meyer Lemon Terrine. Â I didn't try this, as my eating buddy guarded her plate quite closely (just kidding!) but I'm guessing from her clean plate that it was superb. For the second course, I had the Porcini Flan with Dungeness Crab and Black Truffle Dashi. Â There are so many things right with that name, let me count them: Â  1. Porcini Â  2. Flan Â  3. Dungeness Crab Â  4. Truffle So you can see why I had to order it. Â When the dish was placed in front of me, I admit it wasn't what I thought. Â I had expected a porcini-flavored flan; instead it was more of a rich mushroom broth with large pieces of crab and porcini custard on the bottom. Â It was really delicious, and I found myself digging at the bottom of the copper terrine by the end. Another second course option was the Spring Garlic and Almond Soup with Parsley Root, Parsley PurÃ©e and Roasted Black Trumpet Mushrooms. Â This soup emphasized the almond more than the garlic, and according to its eater, was quite delicious - another member of the clean plate club. For the entree course, I had the Organic Long Island Duckling Roasted with Chamomile Honey, Balinese Pepper, Chinese Mustard Cabbage, Bok Choy and Baby Flat Spinach with Buckwheat. Â The duck was medium-rare, my preparation of choice. It was tender, sweet, juicy and had just the right amount of fat and skin. Â I'm not sure what the yellow mash was on the left, but I'm guessing it's the Balinese pepper. Â It was a little too sweet and soft for my taste. With all of the entrees, the chef sent out chive mashed potatoes - that were so scrumptious in their simplicity that I was squeegeeing the bottom of the dish with my spoon. The wait staff was also extremely diligent about keeping our bread plates full - I had a rosemary baguette and apple raisin bread. The fourth course was dessert - but before it came out, we had a pre-dessert courtesy of the chef, as a palate cleanser. Â  We had the Beaujolais Poached Spring Rhubarb with Fresh Raspberries, Cherry Tomato and Rhubarb GranitÃ©, with Greek Yogurt Olive Oil Sorbet. This was the second savory sorbet of the day (the first being the cucumber/celery). Â The sorbet was creamy and the very light olive oil taste was a good combo with the tart rhubarb. I ordered coffee to accompany my dessert, which was pretty standard. Â However, the sugar selection that came with the coffee (below left) was pretty awesome. Â In addition to the standard brown sugar and white sugar cubes, Â the tray had sugar chips. I tried them all, for the sake of research. We also got a second pre-dessert, a tray of sesame crunch squares, passion fruit and coconut rum truffles, raspberry and coconut tuiles, raspberry and passion fruit macarons, strawberry and passion pates de fruits, and chocolate cookies. By now we've had the pre-dessert and the pre-pre-dessert. For THE dessert, I had the Hot Caramelized Anjou Pear with Valrhona Chocolate, Biscuit Breton, Hot Toffee Sauce, and Rosemary and Tahitian Vanilla Ice Creams. The bittersweet chocolate kept the dish from being too cloyingly sweet, while the rosemary ice cream was the third sorbet/ice cream in this meal - yum! The meal ends there, but the yumminess didn't - on the way out, the hostess gave each of us a lemon tea cake from the Bouley bakery - deeelish! Bouley's service is impeccable - it is one of those restaurants that presents each course to all diners at a table simultaneously - in my case, I was dining with 3 others, so 4 waiters would serve us at a time. Fancy. Â They also described each course in detail; I'm a sucker for food descriptions. Â  Finally, if you have any food allergies - not to worry, before we ordered, the waiter asked if any of us had any allergies and was very understanding of our requests. If you've been meaning to try Bouley but were wary of the dent in your wallet, I'd definitely recommend the prix fixe lunch.",1
4718,490,5,8/10/2010,"It doesn't get nay better then this! From the moment you sit down , you are pampered like royalty. Me and my husband flew in for the weekend to celebrate our anniversary. We are big time foodies and I had yet to visit the big apple. The first night we arrived my husband took me to Le Cirque,and I was expecting somewhat of greatness,,after all it was "" Le Cirque"" . Well it may as well be called "" Le Suck"" Horrible service ,cold bread, food very boring and unimpressive. We were shocked. Our hopes and expectations for the second night of dining in the city were very low to say the least. We could not of been more impressed with this restaurant then what we were. Each course was better then the next, and they even threw in extra coursed just for us to try! Amazing ,amazing. The service was of the best I have ever experienced. Each dish is served in unison all together and removed in the same fashion. You really feel like royalty! 10 STARS!",1
4719,490,4,8/10/2010,"Pros: Bouley has great servers. They really made for the whole experience. With great food (much of it being complimentary) and even better service, it was a memorable dinner. Great to take the people/person you love. Con: We initially felt quite stuffy in the restaurant. There were only a few people there and it felt like I was in my great-aunt's living room. We talked in hushed voices because it was just so weird. heh.",1
4720,490,4,8/9/2010,"Spectacular dining experience. Only comment I have is on behalf of vegetarians. Chef will make substitutions or a surprise dish; my surprise dish consisted of a handful of carrots, string beans, fava beans and spinach. It was delicious, but not really reflective of why you would visit this fine establishment. But the service, decor, and pound cake goodie bag was worth it.",1
4721,490,5,8/8/2010,"Eating at Bouley is like being transported to a faraway land on vacation. You open a rustic door labeled just with the restaurant's name and enter a welcoming room with apples placed on the wall as if you were in a farmhouse in Provence. The maitre'd is extremely pleasant to deal with and offers to seat you and give you a drink if you are early. The dining room itself feels like a Garden of Eden with its ample supply of flowers. Everywhere one looks, there is a motif suggesting love, making this the most romantic restaurant in the city. Highlights of our choices from tasting menu include oysters with caviar or egg with artichoke as appetizers, lamb main course, as well as the large stacked dessert plate at the end of the meal which includes macarons.",1
4722,490,5,7/22/2010,The prefix price summer tasting menu is $36 with tax and tips cost me about $45-46 . I truly think the value I received is far beyond the price I paid. Bouley has gorgeous restaurant setting decorated with fresh flower and apple + super friendly staff on the floor serving w/ detail of attention+ delicious food that was carefully prepared + on top of my own dessert order we received extra complimentary dessert dish and cookies on the house Â + a to go bag w/ complimentary fresh cake from the bakery. This is the best meal I've ever had in NYC but not the highest price I ever paid. But I do have to said their cold soup and dessert is better than the main course =p I just love this place and surely will go back again!,1
4723,490,2,7/17/2010,"wow, what a disappointment...having read prior reviews, we were really looking forward to an amazing meal...we even cancelled a reservation at another Michelin 2 star restaurant to eat here... it started out well...cocktails in the cozy lounge were romantic and elegant; sadly, it was all downhill from there... the pros: being asked from the get Â go if there were any food allergies (which there were) was great...but wow, it was an Olympic slalom from there on in...amuse bouce was tasteless...appetizer took 45 minutes! when we aksed what was going on, we were told, ""they simmer the foie gras."" Really? When it finally arrived: so-so, to say the least. It continued from there. Simply mediocre, nothing to tell. The staff were attentive, yet apathetic. Overall, really disappointing across the board.",1
4724,490,4,7/16/2010,"I could type till my fingertips bleed about Bouley, (or at least to Yelp's character limit), but I'll TRY to refrain. Most of the yelp reviews here are fairly accurate. Therefore, I will elaborate about four, very notable facets of my night at Bouley. Impromptu random reservations, atmosphere, venison and meeting Chef David Bouley himself. Let's start at the beginning: 1) Impromptu - Scenario is as follows: One Sunday, many moons ago, I spent a long arduous day of wine tasting out on the North Fork of Long Guyland. If you've been out there you know most of the tasting rooms shut down between 5-6pm. We were getting hungry and ornery. Fellow food elitist Gaurav P and I hop into the car and drive west. We're indecisive. Fish? Fromage? OH, here's an idea. FRENCH! We're already driving in the direction to NYC. Yes! AMEX platinum concierge gets called and some how by a stroke of luck we end up with 8:30 reservations at Bouley. Fan-freakingtastic and absolutely random. 2) Atmosphere - It's country French, but modern. It's sophisticated but trendy. It's Bouley.... and it's fantastic. When you walk inside, you're greeted with a room full of fresh aromatic apples. Then you're lead to a room with a comfy, Hamptons look and feel with big fat American velvety suede chairs, containing Â an over abundance of haphazardly crafted flower arrangements. There certainly is an air of sophistication as most of the clientÃ¨le is over 40 and wearing stiff dress coats. The wait staff is attentive and ethnically diverse. The food comes out in grandeur (total food porn), course by course and the staff meticulously ensures the table has been cleared with fresh silverware and plates every time. The descriptions of each tasting menu dish are short and to the point, leaving you wondering what your palette is going to experience, before you eat it. 3) Venison - Growing up as a hunter's daughter I've been exposed to ALL sorts of fowl, game, and stories about ""daddy killing bambi"". In fact, on long guyland, we have an over abundance of deer. You'll often find the cadavers on the side of the William Floyd parkway or near Hecksher park. The last time I had venison it was in large stringy clumps, smoking on the BBQ. I was naive and tricked into eating it (I was also 12!). Ugh, yuck. I found it tragically unappealing. However -- Â It was on the menu at Bouley, and my dining partner is in love with it. He ordered another course for himself, but they came out with two. I had to try it. Since then, ill never look back. Chef Bouley, made the most tender, succulent venison I've EVER tasted. The rich, deep sauce complemented the perfectly cooked meat. As I was savoring it, I was pondering "" THIS is Bambi?? No wonder his mother was shot. Ohhhhh.."" PS: I don't like red meat either. 4) Chef David Bouley - Wow. To this day, I still can't believe what happened. WE MET CHEF DAVID BOULEY! Recently being a fan of kitchen tours, we inquired with our waiter about taking a peek inside Bouley's kitchen. He was responsive and worked something out for us. He came by at one point to casually tell us ""the chef's not ready yet"". We nodded and thought nothing of it. 30 mins later we were lead in to the kitchen and personally greeted by Chef Bouley. Initially, I didn't even realize who it was. I read his coat "" Chef David Bouley"". My eyes widened. My mind raced "" Is.. this..really.. oooh"". Wow, we shook his hand and chatted for at LEAST 20 minutes about the restaurant and fishing industry, french food, current trends etc. I'm awestruck. He was shockingly down to earth and humble, telling us tales about working on the fishing boats as a kid and teaching us a lesson about lobsters and langoustines. We were even able to snap a picture, and I got a bit of a hug too. Such a charmer ! Geez, what a night....",1
4725,490,5,7/9/2010,"We had lunch at Bouley today. We tried spring lunch menu It was unbelievable. The food was great, the service was impeccable. Everybody was really helpful. Highly recommended! It was really special!",1
4726,490,4,7/3/2010,"A great value and charming restaurant, but I'd rate it slightly below 4 stars, yet definitely more than 3 in terms of taste. I came here on suggestion of my friend who said the lunch tasting menu was a great value for a 2 star Michelin restaurant ($48 per person). We had a bit of trouble finding the spot but knew it when we saw it. Â After opening the front doors, you're greeted by a wall of apples. Â The smell was SO fragrant, it was amazing. Â After confirming our reservation, we were whisked away to another world. Â Okay, it was to the main room but the decor was just breathtaking. Â It was European and elegant, but also fun and almost romantic. Some of the dishes we had included: -Chilled Kumamoto Oysters with Oscetra Caviar, Live Sea Scallops and Parsley Juice: the dish itself was very pretty. Â The oysters were pretty briny, so I was a bit disappointed, but my boyfriend didn't mind. -Porcini Flan with Dungeness Crab in Black Truffle Dashi: this was fairly tasty, though it was quite salty. -Duckling: cooked perfectly, very tender (see pic). Â I felt a twinge of sadness upon thinking we were eating ""duckling"". Â It's like akin to eating ""piglet"" or something, conjuring up cute little baby farm animals. -Coconut soup with Passionfruit, Pineapple GranitÃ© Organic Yogurt Sorbet was delicious and very refreshing, and did it's job of cleansing my palate. -Snowball of Crisp White Meringue: meh. Â The snowball looked very cool but was hollow and didn't mesh very well with the sorbet for some reason. -Hot Valrhona Chocolate SoufflÃ© with Vermont Maple and Vanilla Ice creams, Chocolate Sorbet: definitely liked this one better than my snowball. Â Very chocolatey and the ice creams were perfect with the warm soufflÃ©. Â  The tier of cookies at the end with coffee was a nice touch too. The restaurant itself seems huge. Â We walked downstairs to use the restroom and it reminded me of a winery or chateau with high archways and nice decorations. Â I definitely recommend you at least check out the rest of the restaurant, it really wowed us because we felt worlds apart from the hustle and bustle of the city outside. The service was superb, and I didn't feel rushed in any way. Â They gave me a little cake at the end to take home too. Â  Overall, the bottom line is that I think you get what you pay for. Â It's a very good deal and I like that you get a nice variety of items to choose from, but some things were just a little off in terms of flavors and textures. Â The wow factor for us was not the food but the charm and elegance of the place itself; it's like a soothing European mini-vacay for a few hours right in the middle of one of the world's busiest cities. Â I'd definitely recommend it to anyone.",1
4727,490,4,7/1/2010,"Very nice meal! We went for lunch on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon not bearing in mind that it also happened to be Father's Day. Â Neither the Spring special lunch menu nor the regular lunch menu was available that day, so we decided to choose from the a la carte menu. As you walk in , you almost feel like you're heading to someone's French garden for lunch. Â You forget immediately that you are in New York City. Â The fresh floral arrangements, garden furniture and and floral paintings really set the ambiance and you pretty much instantly get the feeling that you are in for a nice experience. As we browsed their menu, we were given wonderfully delicious baked breads. Â So fresh and warm and quite tasty. Â I really enjoyed their apple raisin bread the most. Â I had to stop myself from eating more so I'd have room for my appetizer. Â Anyway, as we sat there a couple and their what looked to be a child of about one year old. Â First thought that entered my mind was, 'NOOOOOOOO!' Â  Â *Goes on her soapbox** That child won't last 10 minutes without balling or acting up, much less 2 to 3 hours. Dining in an establishment like this takes about that long with all the courses. Â  Â Why in the world would you bring a small child to a fine-dining restaurant? Â Makes no sense to me. Â In fact, it seems sort of retarded. If you can afford to eat at such a place, you can certainly afford a sitter for a few hours while you and the Mister go some place nice. Â This is not TGIF. Â I began to get leery. Â Then before our amuse bouche came out., sure enough, the child not only began to cry wildly, but was screaming as all the guests in the dining room sort of tried not to give these young parents the look of disgust. Please tell me this was not going to be my lunch experience. Â Just when I began to get annoyed, the parents quickly high-tailed it out of there before they could order and left the restaurant! Â Wow! I thought they were just going to take a little walk to calm the baby down, but they actually left the restaurant. Â Did they not know this might occur? Â Ughh, all I know was I was happy. Â  So on to the food! The amuse bouche was a very light melon soup with chunks of smoked trout. Perfect for the season was the cold melon soup, however, didn't really mix well with the saltiness of the trout. It was a strange combo, so I didn't really finish it. Â Next up was the appetizer. Â I had the Chilled Kumamoto Oysters, Oscetra Caviar with Homemade Radish Pickle, Thinly Sliced Live Sea Scallops with Parsley Juice. Â Very fresh and very delicious! Â I love caviar and I love Kumamoto Oysters even more! Â I was very pleased as the flavors really suited each other. I could have easily have settled on more of these as just my main dish. I decided to go with the Fresh Washington State Black Cod Organic Buckwheat, Sunchoke Cloud with Black Onion Powder. By this time, I was getting a little full but I still enjoyed the cod. It was well prepared and quite fresh as well. Â I was pleased with the dish, however, I was still craving those oysters! Â I skipped ordering dessert, however I was still presented with Â the Hot Caramelized Anjou Pear Valrhona Chocolate , Biscuit Breton, Hot Toffee Sauce RÃ©glisse Sorbet and Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream. Â Nothing like warm pears! Â I could barely touch it as I was pretty full, but the Reglisse Sorbet was pretty divine! Â Wow, so delicious! Â We also had petite fours along with a mix of various chocolates and cookies, I just could not! Â The coffee was also quite delicious and bold. Â A great accompaniment for the dessert. All in all, with great service, minus baby and gorgeous ambiance, I would go back here for lunch however, I cannot imagine going for the $95 lunch tasting menu they were offering for Father's Day. Â I was happy with the portions and selections I got, but despite that, I see this as a one-time dining spot for me.",1
4728,490,5,6/28/2010,"Strongly recommended! Nice restaurant setting, great service, and awesome food. Â  The lunch pre-fix is the best deal ever! I just visited Paris, and I was desperate looking for something to match that level, and Bouley it is! The only drawback is that I don't like their expresso... it didn't taste like coffee. Â But they serve great quality sugar, so I just mixed them for a drink.",1
4729,490,5,6/25/2010,"Are you looking for an over-the-top, out-of-this-world dining experience? You have come to the right place. Though we were a sophisticated group of 6 young students and professionals, we drew a few glances from our fellow patrons upon our arrival; we were the youngest people in the restaurant by at least 25 years. Â  Much to our surprise, 6 waiters in suits and ties delivered our menus, and really took it upon themselves to turn our dining experience into a theatrical production. They coordinated the pouring of our water and wine, as well as the removal and delivery of our plates with absolute precision. The food was exquisite, each plate more delicious than the last. The amuse bouche, fresh bread selection, and chocolate and cookie platter served at the end of the meal were delicious (complimentary) additions, and appreciated by everyone in our party. On our way out, we were each given a beautifully packaged lemon pound cake ""to enjoy for breakfast,"" we were told. A formal affair in every sense of the word, but a must for anyone who likes to indulge from time to time.",1
4730,490,4,6/25/2010,Charming and lovely interior. Â Service is attentive and professional but not overbearing. Â Food is excellent but not necessarily innovative or unique.,1
4731,490,3,6/25/2010,"Bouley excels at ambience. Â You are overcome by it as soon as you walk through the main door of the restaurant. Â The air is redolent of an apple orchard in the French countryside, an effect created by lining shelves with row after row of fresh, polished red apples. Â Stunning and oh so fragrant. Â You are then led through a stately dining room. Â The eyes are immediately distracted by the arched ceilings, the swooping arcs, and the beautiful paintings. Â Elegant, yes, but you are immediately comfortable. Â It is a striking mix of le chateau and la vie fermiere -- a most impressive use of space. Once seated, we were presented with the menus. Â We were there Sunday for lunch, but it was not just any Sunday, apparently it was Father's day which had completely slipped my mind. Â So instead of the usual $48 lunch menu, they had a special $95 lunch menu in honor of the day. Â None of the selections seemed special in anyway, so the excuse for doubling the price was lost on me. Â We opted for a la carte. Â It took me a little while to study the menu, and I found it very curious to be interrupted reading the menu to proceed with the bread service AND the serving of the amuse bouche. Â I simply have never buttered my bread and ate and worked through a very sizable amuse bouche while reading a menu before. Â  Eventually though, we were given the chance to order. The amuse bouche was a chalice of melon soup with green apple foam and with chunks of smoked trout interspersed. Â Were the flavors congruous? Â Not so much. Â Did I get the feeling I was being served leftover fish? Â Yes. Â  The lunch formally began with my order of the porcini flan. Â This arrived with fanfare and was served in its own copper cooking vessel perched prominently on my plate. Â The lid was removed for me and the aromatic steam was released. Â Lingering over the table was the smell of fresh mushrooms. Â The flan included porcinis and black truffles and was punctuated with hefty pieces of Dungeness crab. Â It was really a wonderful dish. Â The crab was very fresh and surprisingly worked well with the natural earthiness of the dish. Â This was a great beginning. For the main course, I opted for the Long Island duckling. Â It was served as several cutlets all in mutual contact with the cuts performed on a bias. Â These rested on the natural jus of the duck mixed with ginger dressing and a touch of verjus for acidity. Â The cutlets were buttressed by pureed, Tahitian vanilla-glazed turnips on the one side and cabbage on the other. Â The duck was perfectly cooked and very enjoyable to eat. Â I liked the different flavors emanating from the dish in an effort to enhance the taste. Â Ultimately though, the presentation was curiously simple, and there was perhaps too much duck. Â The law of diminishing returns applied soon enough, and I found myself bored. Â I was happy when I finally finished the dish. Â  Prior to dessert we were served a palate cleanser: Â rhubarb granita with a dollop of ice cream. Â The rhubarb was especially flavorful and fresh, and the course functioned well. For dessert I ordered the hot Valrhona chocolate souffle, and my girlfriend declined on dessert all together. Â Some time had passed, and we were then both presented with desserts. Â We explained that only one dessert was ordered, but they insisted the dessert was compliments of the house. Â Verifying the bill showed that in fact both desserts were compliments of the house, probably because my dessert was not exactly a souffle though. Â What I had was more of a chocolate lava cake. Â I mean, there was no ramekin, no puffed up cake, nothing. Â However, there were plenty of other chocolate confections placed throughout the plate. Â There was a very narrow bowl of chocolate mousse that proved very difficult to eat since the bowl was too narrow for the entry of a spoon. Â Fortunately I was still able to put my fork to good use and still taste at its deliciousness. Â There were also two servings of ice cream which I took to be chocolate and rum respectively, a variant of a dacquoise, and a marshmallow like construction. Â While perplexing, everything was actually quite good. After dessert, a three tiered tray of confections and a complimentary lemon cake were presented to round out the lunch. I paid the bill, and we proceeded to leave. Â We were followed very closely by the manager through the main floor of the restaurant and out to the lobby. Â He explained, once we reached the main foyer, that it is a tradition to walk the patrons to the door upon their exiting. Â This was ostensibly a sincere gesture, but it felt forced and awkward. Â Did I accidentally walk away with the pen perhaps, I was thinking to myself. Overall, Bouley is a mixed bag. Â The restaurant is beautiful and you want to eat there. Â You quickly forget that you are even in a city anymore. Â That is memorable. Â What is not so memorable is the food. Â I would go for a $48 lunch, but not a $95 lunch; and I would skip the $250 dinner entirely. 3.75 star",1
1932,490,5,6/16/2010,"One of the more cozy Michelin star restaurants. The decor is luxe french countryside. The chairs are soooo comfortable. The service is impeccable. The host, waiters, everyone is extremely accommodating. The last time I went we got a bottle of Riesling. I don't recall what the amuse bouche was that time but I do remember eating a ton of their addictive bread. For food, we decided to go the a la carte route and I started off with the Porcini Flan with Dungeness Crab which was absolutely delicious. I don't know how I have never ordered that before. For my entree I went with Chicken Baked ""En Cocotte"" which was also very good. We decided to split dessert and went with Hot Caramelized Anjou Pear and they also brought out a complimentary creme brulee-both were soo good. Afterwards a tray with chocolates and cookies came out which I had boxed up to go since I was simply stuffed. This is an absolutely wonderful restaurant!",1
3093,490,5,6/1/2010,"I brought my girlfriend here in early May for the Spring Menu prix-fixe lunch. Â We prepared for an afternoon of gluttony by jogging three laps around the Central Park reservoir that morning, then strategically starving ourselves until 2pm. It was so worth it. Â  The weather outside that day was 90, humid, and sunny. Â By the time we got to the restaurant (via subway) I was sweating through my shirt and in an absolutely foul mood. Â I didn't really stop to waft in the scents of the famous ""Apple room,"" and opted to head straight for the inner, air conditioned waiting room. Â  Our host, dressed in suit and tie, seated us on soft couches while our table was prepared. Â I was grateful for the ten minute wait--didn't really want to be seen in the dining room looking like I had just ran a marathon in business casual. The room is gorgeously decorated, with live flowers and plants all along the windows and enormous, framed oil paintings on every wall. Apparently, Mr. Bouley spared no expense on the interior of his flagship restaurant. We were seated in the outer room, so that we could peer out of the curtained windows (through the flowers) at a little park in the heart of TriBeCa while we ate. Â The room was very quiet, and everyone spoke in hushed tones above the tinkling of silverware. Â  On to the food! Â  The canapÃ© was cool and refreshing, and the first course followed soon after. Â We got the Sashimi tuna and Garlic/Almond soup. Â  For course number two I chose the Porcini Flan with Dungeness Crab, and my gf got the Chatham Skate. Â I'm no food expert, but the Porcini Flan was the most delicious, savoury dish I have ever had. Â If I could recommend one dish from this entire meal the Flan would be it. Â I wish I could've gotten a few orders of it to go. Â The skate was a bit too... mango-y; the sour taste overpowering. Next was the rhubarb and tomato sorbet, which was again very refreshing for a hot summer day. Â It kinda tasted like a V8 slushy (Bouley would probably facepalm himself if he read my description of his concoction, but that's the closest comparison I can make haha...). We both got the Chocolate Frivolous for dessert, which in retrospect was probably a bad idea, since we spent the rest of the day in the mixed state of a sugar high food coma. Â I'll simply say this: look at the pictures before you make a double order of this dessert. Â If you LOVE chocolate and can't get enough of it... well, you'll probably meet your match here. Â Everything was delicious, but my God... it was frivolous. All in all an incredible meal and an incredible experience for a totally affordable price. Â We each had a glass of Reisling, and the total price tag still only came out to $125 (including tax/tip). Â For a Michelin rated restaurant, that is pretty awesome. Â The service was impeccable, my water glass was never more than half empty, and the transition in between courses was seamless. Â We ate for 2+ hours, but only because we chose to, not because the wait staff and kitchen were slow. Afterward we took pictures in the beautiful sitting room, and when my gf left her camera case the host called us and kept it safe for pick up the next day. On our way out, I even stopped to sniff the apples.",1
4732,490,4,5/29/2010,"[This review is based on the new $36 lunch menu-- dinner is a whole different story] Having been to (the old and new) Bouley a few times, I have noticed that I always walk away with the same mixed feelings. Â  For instance, the place looks like it was designed by Donald Trump's slightly classier brother. Â And that aint really a compliment. Â I'm not sure what they are going for, whether it is country french or barely-over-the-top gaudiness or ""luxury"", but its just not that pleasant to the modern and discerning eye. I just don't like it. Â Oh well. Also, the service is just a bit too stuffy -- more so than Daniel or Jean-Georges. Â Staff has never explained the components of a single dish to me (which I like to know). Â They also lack a certain warmness that the other 4-star competitors have. With that said, you just can't beat a 6-course meal (for lunch) in that place for $36. Â The dishes aren't all hits, but there were no big misses either. Â Had some really delicious smoked, cured Salmon and my chocolate dessert was really about 5 desserts in all. Chocolate heaven. Â Then you get the petit-fors. Â Yippee! Â The wine pairings are $45, so its kinda funny to spend more on wine than food but sometimes that happens. (Rarely at lunch, though). In short, get this deal at least once while you can. Â We left stuffed and feeling good about paying what we did. Â It was a lot of food and way above-average quality. Â  And just laugh (or hold your nose) at the gaudy decor and the stick-up-their-asses waitstaff.",1
4733,490,5,5/25/2010,"Another outstanding NY dining experience. This was a ""wow"" for sure. In Tribeca, two blocks from Marc Forgione (a fave of mine) is Bouley. They each have a Michelin star and each couldn't be more different than the other. While Forgione is casual, Bouley is elegant....waiters in suits and ties elegant. Gorgeous design, elegant manor sets high expectations for the food. Those expectations were definitely met. Waiting a few minutes outside the main room we were served a glass of champagne (in mismatched glasses curiously enough). Two sips in we were escorted to our table. Service was right there. Our waiter was the right balance of courteous, casual and confident. Wine list (very good) and menus. Bottled water. Ordering began. My guest began with the Organic Connecticut Farm Egg, Serrano Ham, Steamed Polenta, Artichoke All-Natural Radish Sprouts, and Coconut-Garlic Broth. I countered with Harwich Wild Blue Fin Tuna, Chu Toro, Fresh Hawaiian Heart of Palm, and Yuzo-Miso Dressing. Both were excellent. The sommelier came by. I ordered a 1999 Chateau Musar, an old friend. The waiter was a bit surprised and delighted that I went Musar. Not many people know about it evidently. Next were entrees. Long Island Duckling with a Balinese Pepper Crust, White Truffle Honey, Fresh Fava Beans, Japanese Sweet Kabu Turnips, Ginger, Lemon Thyme, and Lemon Verbena Sauce for my guest. I ordered the All-Natural Pennsylvania Chicken Baked ""En Cocotte"" with Alfalfa and Clover Hay, Fresh Fava Beans, Buttermilk and Tarragon. Both were, again, excellent. The pace of the meal was languorous. The food excellent. The service impeccable. The ambiance beautiful. The evening unbeatable. Highly recommended.",1

The restaurant was Â nearly empty, with 2-3 table occupied. After we ordered 2 glasses of wine and some appetizers, our waiter told us that the minimum chef requires is to order 1 entree per person. "" You don't have to order appetizers""-he said. Well, we did not feel like eating anything heavy, not for the price reason, but just because we did not feel like it. The reasoning did not work, and we just decided to leave. Shame on the place, given that they push away their professional customers. I would never recommend this place to anyone.",1

While the staff was relatively attentive, polite, and friendly, there's simply no excuse for a prix fixe dinner for two taking three and a half hours. It could have bearable if the food was amazing, but every dish was at best boring. We went for thirty minutes at a time with no food other than bread on the table. Add to that the fact that the couple sitting right next to us arrived thirty minutes after we did and finished twenty minutes before us even though they ordered the same seven course meal with wine pairing. Skip this place and head to Le Bernardin.",1

The server was professional and well dressed, and our bottles of wine were brought to us promptly. The food did take quite a while to get finished, but once it did I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Chunks of avocado, thin, crispy homemade chips, I was in heaven. Then came the burger, with English Muffins for buns, very little fluff, just a fantastic medium-rare burger.

Â We opted for their 6 course tasting menu and wine pairing. Â This turned into 9 courses as they included a complimentary amuse bouche, an additional dessert tray and an anniversary creme brulee. Â If that wasn't enough, when we left, they gave us 2 loaves of bread from their bakery next door. Â  Each course that they brought out was even more delectable than the last. Â  Despite the elegant ambiance, I picked up the bowl of pureed potatoes and did everything but lick it clean it was so mouth watering. Â By the 5th course I was certain I could not eat another bite but I found room because everything was so good I did not want to miss out on a single bite.",1

Just about every course was so good it was almost as though I had never truly tasted that dish before in my life. From lobster to pork loin to salmon perfection sat on every plate. And the service was every bit as good as the food. 5 servers simultaneously attending to your every need. Not once did I have to ask for water or need to pour my own wine, and yet, while it might seem overbearing it was all done as effortlessly as if they were simply five fingers on the hand of a single waiter. It was THAT good.",1
4743,490,5,4/26/2010,"Bouley has an aura and an ambience of a secret society meeting place. Â You keep expecting a wall to move and show you where the riff-raff eats and why they don't know that Bouley exists. Service here is top flight from the person who checks you in, takes your coat and offers you a beverage. Â It is lavishly decorated and comfortably tabled with plenty of room. Â The menu requires a long read and possibly a United Nations headset since they offer choices that would take hours to contemplate. Do not come to Bouley if you need to get somewhere! Â Service takes an eternity and costs your children a college education. Â The nice thing is that they take care of you and even bring you things to try if you're game.

4745,490,4,4/6/2010,"4.5 stars, 4 for food, extra 0.5 for excellent service. First of all, the inside of the restaurant is BEAUTIFUL. I was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful smelling apple-lined room upon walking in, and enjoyed the rooms that were filled to the brim with fresh flowers. My family and I ordered from the lunch tasting menu, which offered 5 courses. If you are a mushroom and crab lover, and even if you aren't, you HAVE to try the porcini flan (appetizer). It is a light and flavorful flan that is chock full of fresh dungeness crab and is delicious! Other highlights: - Long Island Duckling: crispy skin and tender, juicy meat - Coconut Soup with Passionfruit & Pineapple Granite and Organic Yogurt Sorbet: extremely refreshing and not too sweet - Valrohna Chocolate Souffle served with maple and vanilla ice creams, and chocolate sorbet: the maple ice cream was too sweet for me, and the vanilla didn't taste enough like vanilla to me. However, the sorbet and souffle are EXCELLENT. It's nothing too fancy, but definitely hits the spot. Also, be sure to try the breads that come from the Bouley bakery. I was particularly fond of the fig and olive breads. Just try not to eat too much - you'll be full from eating the tasting menu alone! For a fancy lunch, you can't beat the $50/person price tag. With excellent service to boot, Bouley is definitely a must-visit in NYC.",1

My 3 stars for Bouley are generous, due to a poorly handled snafu that almost ruined an otherwise truly great meal. For the food and service generally it would have been a 5 star recommendation, except .... We went there for a birthday dinner Â - 6 of us. 5 had the tasting menu. Each and every dish was superb Â - a mouth watering treat, well presented, with attentive service, comfortable surroundings, everything perfect. Â After the fish course, cod for some, lobster and crab for me (mmmmm!), there was an unexplained delay. This stretched on for too long. Afterabout 25 minutes, our inquiry brought a tepid, 'it should be coming soon, sir'. But this was a lie. Â After 35 minutes, we were told (after again having to ask where is our food?) that they were having some delays in the kitchen. After 45 minutes, and another query, we were again told that the kitchen was backed up , but that our meat course would be coming 'shortly'. It finally arrived about 50 to 55 minutes after the prior course. the remainder of the meal was expedited, and we were offered extra desserts and a complimentary Madeira wine with dessert, but by the time we left we had been sitting there for nearly 4 hours - which is a bit ridiculous. Â The manager came up at the end to apologize, but what was needed was a proper explanation at the time of the problem (apparently a large party in the downstairs room) and an ameliorative offered at that moment; such as, We're terribly sorry, there will be a delay before your next course - here's a complimentary bottle of wine to thank you for your patience. But sadly, not offered to us. So the affair ended with some disappointment.",1

The service started out very friendly and impeccable. Our main waiter was very nice and helped us have the tasting menu with a few modifications. We started out with the sashimi and the mushroom flan. Both were tasty and excellent. Â Next came the salmon with blood orange sauce, mustard seed, and safron. This was definitely my favorite dish of the night. Then we had both the fried egg and the black cod. Next, we had both the duckling and the lamb dishes. The duckling was incredible, being very tender and absolutely wonderful to eat. Then came a slew of desserts. Way too many for even me to finish. There were two dessert dishes. Then the chef brought out a complimentary creme brulee for us, along with about 15 bite-sized other snacks, all of which were awesome. The wine pairing we had with each course was also very much worth it. The experience we had at Bouley was right up there amongst other top-notch restaurants in the city.

Â the coffee ic cream was definitely my favorite part chocolate souffle - the vanilla ic cream was the favorite amongst maple and chocolate. Â the souffle pretty much went untouched. the food overall was good, but i would've liked more variety in texture. service - i honestly expected a lot more.

4752,490,5,2/18/2010,"Honestly, I'm pretty sure this is the best dining experience New York has to offer. Food, atmosphere, service (we had 5 people constantly waiting on us) = stellar. I was so lucky to be taken here for valentines day... SO SO sweet. Big time points. ;) The interior of Bouley is gorgeous. The first thing you notice when you check in in the smell of apples in the coat room, and the lounge area is filled with the smell of fresh flowers. The decor is kind of traditional/french but is beautifully done. Â Such a romantic place for a date. We are both foodies, so we really enjoyed choosing both of our menus so that we could try everything we wanted. The chocolate dessert was OVERWHELMING. I made the strategic decision to just take one bite of each piece - I highly recommend this technique. We had the 5 course tasting menu, and paired it with a bottle of French spicy red. I chose foie gras for my main and it was certainly the best entree I've ever had. So tender and buttery with a cherry reduction. Such a great flavor blend. Â Portions were perfect - the food is so fragrant and delicate you don't need or want a ton of each dish. Just enough take in the taste and fragrance. Â All of the dishes were plated beautifully, and the textures of each dish were very unique. I love the fact that you can watch the kitchen through the windows that face the street as you're leaving. You can actually see everyone scrambling and plating the dishes you just ate and enjoyed. I liked seeing David Bouley working hard to impress his clients. Â Bravo, dude! Best meal I've had, and certainly the best date. :)",1
4753,490,5,2/16/2010,"No-messing-way. Last minute decisions, last minute dinner plans always work out for the best it seems. Pour moi, at least. A little foodie spontaneity never killed me before. What's a food adventure without the element of surprise, right? Sunday evening , I met my dear friend Jess, her boyfriend Peter and their good friend Bryan at Bouley. A semi-planned evening, seeing that she invited me the week before but not so since I only confirmed the evening of. Not cool, I know. Anyhoo, I was pretty sure we were about to dive into another world. I was excited. I still am, to be honest. We ordered the Chef's Menu - 6 courses of utter awesomeness in my mouth - with the wine pairing. Favourite picks of the evening: porcini flan, Maine lobster, spring lamb, and the chocolate-walnut spiced bread. I've never had a porcini flan but I Â found myself savouring every bite as if it were my last.. and this was only the first tasting. The black dashi, I am convinced, brought out the mushroom flavours to the point of sheer appreciation. The chervil sauce served with the lobster had the perfect lemon-y kick all seafood craves and the parsnip cloud was pretty. Yes, it was pretty. Pretty in presentation and pretty great tasting as well. The spring lamb was hearty and comforting - swiss chard, kale, garlic shoots and potato puree rounded the dish very well. Lastly, I was happy I ended with the chocolate-walnut spiced bread. Not as heavy as it might sound and with a cappuccino, the coziness of the evening wrapped itself around the insides of my tummy. As mentioned, I think awesomeness in my mouth pretty much covers it all. Taste for yourself, I say. As with any tasting/prix fixe menu, timing and portion size are both extremely important. Leaving Bouley, I did not feel over served in both wine and food. The best kind of feeling, really, because not only did we have a fantastical leisure evening wining and dining, we most certainly felt spoiled as well. Oh! Did I mention the insane bread cart? Not a basket, a cart! See, I'm in love. Service was impeccable, the bread Â tasted as if I were in France again, and the cozy warm space was most welcomed. Mixed reviews or not, my time at Bouley was memorable and I can only hope I'll make another trip before leaving NYC. Je t'aime!",1

Â Inside it's a cozy romantic cave--sloping ceilings and walls painted a deep red, pretty little tables set up against squishy banquets and low candlelight. The menu is wonderful--and the fact that you can pick and choose around the tasting menu is great--I'm a bit picky and always want to try these, but don't want to miss out on courses. Surprisingly, the amuse was one of my favorite parts--a chilled tomato gazpacho with seafood, avocado and scallions. yum. The icing on top of the cake was the fact that the guy with the bread cart came around 5 times. I'm a carb-aholic, and the fact that there are 15 different flavors (olive, pistachio, raisin, whole grain, rosemary, etc) put me in carb-heaven. Â  Get the wine pairing--it was a great adventure from a dry white to a sweet dessert finish.",1
4755,490,4,2/6/2010,"Get the tasting menu. Â  Make nice with the waiter. Â Wait for David Bouley to come out of the kitchen! I got a tour of the kitchen! It was an amazing experience. Unfortunately, the bill was not such an amazing experience, but I felt it was worth it after getting the tasting menu and a bunch of freebies from Mr. Bouley!",1
4756,490,5,2/5/2010,"I was only here for the last 25% of Bouley's Â tasting menu that my sister and her boyfriend shared to celebrate her job promotion, but this last course of their meal immediately established that Bouley is the is one of the best in NY dining. The doorway to Bouley reminds me of the beginning of Alice in Wonderland; it is small and discrete, but grants entry to a wonderful and mystical world of dining. Â Bouley's first impression is a wall of apples, filling the room with a smell that is indescribable. Â For one thing, it made me want to know more of this restaurant's treasures. Â  I walked into Bouley's lounge area, decorated with plush chairs and couches of deep blue hues and greens, where the hostess lead me to Bouley's dining room. This room is gorgeous. Â It reminded me of Sophia Coppola's film 'Marie Antoinette.' Â Rich colors, fabrics, art, and most importantly, rich food can be found in this room. Â All fit for French royalty. Â As I sat down, the waiter gave me a set of silverware, so I could share in the celebration by eating dessert with my family. Â  Dessert, a chocolate souffle and citrus sorbet, arrived. Â Both were edible works of art, almost too beatiful to destroy with our spoons. Â We had to though, and they were worth it. Â  Following this dessert came a tray of complimentary cookies and chocolates. Â They were just as beautiful and just as delicious the dish before. Â  We thought Bouley's edible enchantments had ended after we paid the check, but like it had one more treat for us. Â After the hostess retrieved our coats she came back with a lemon tea cake for each of us to take home. Â A very sweet way to end the evening.",1
4757,490,5,2/4/2010,"Why do they only give your 5 stars to rate these restaurants?...This is a 10 STAR place. Jackets, Sports coat even a Windsor tie are a must gentleman!...lol I was taken here by my x girlfriend for my B-Day years ago. I don't remember how long but this place is stained in my head! The food was culinary artwork by the finest chefs in NYC! It's a great date spot but not for a first one because you'll break the bank on this spot! Expensive but worth every dollar! Not for the faint heart-ed. You need this place on your life resume'! I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IT TO THOSE WHO LOVE TO DINE IN OPULENCE & ELEGANCE!!",1
4758,490,3,1/30/2010,"We high hopes for Bouley, but disappointed. We expected to pay the price for this fancy french restaurant, but the quality of the food didn't match its prices. I had the tasting menu, nothing on it was memorable, and the wagyu filet was as real disappointment. Will not be back. We enjoyed going to the bakery for some macaroons more than the dinner itself.",1
4759,490,5,1/25/2010,"Bouley. Wow. I have been to some top of the rated restaurants in the country, but Bouley totally blew me away. Everything about it is incredible. The decor is very fancy but relaxed including very comfortable couch like dining chairs. The arched ceilings, hand masoned floor, draped curtains, and paintings of the French countryside make you feel as if you are transported to a different world. Midway through the meal I realized I was totally engrossed in the food and didn't have a care in the world. Each dish had so much going that it was like an exploration. If you go during the day their prix fixe is less than $50 per person for five official courses (but it ended up being more like 7 courses including a couple gifts from chef). If you and your companion order different choices for each course and share, you end up tasting countless items. Their wine by the glass actually has a lot of relatively affordable (less than $20 or even $15) choices so you can get various glasses for the same price of a bottle. I recommend letting the waiter know your price range and desired number of glasses and having them choose the wine to match the courses. The staff is very knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly and helped make the experience and the entire day perfect. Leaving the restaurant I felt as if I was floating on a cloud. Go there. It's absolutely incredible.",1
1972,490,5,1/18/2010,"Bouley is perfect for special occasions when you want to be somewhere memorable. The smell of apples permeating the entrance told me I was in for something amazing. In an age of sleek modern decor Bouley brings elegance and a finely tuned attention to detail that is a nice change of pace. Loved the soaring vaulted ceilings, huge flower arrangements, impressionist landscapes and soft comfy chairs. For dinner I tried the kumamato oysters, which was layered deliciously with sliced scallop and topped with caviar. And the sea bass as well was perfectly cooked. The dessert - I had the pear - was good but not as memorable. Service was exceedingly polite and attentive. It was a perfect experience.",1
4760,490,4,1/14/2010,"I've only eaten here once, but the dish I got was *amazing*! Orichette pasta with kale, black truffle butter sauce, and soybean seasoning on top. Sounded a bit odd, but it was so incredibly delicious. The wine list was quite nice as well. Got a good red at the recommendation of the waiter and it complemented the pasta perfectly. Didn't get a chance to try the mixed drinks, but the menu looked very interesting. Will have to go back and try those next time!",1
4761,490,2,1/8/2010,"our dinner at Bouley on Christmas Night, 12/25/09, was a very disappointing night...while I understand it was Christmas the staff was woefully unprepared at the front of the house to help anyone who came in with a reservation. We waited over an hour just to be seated because apparently many people lingered at an earlier seating. Isn't this something that Bouley and other top restaurants deal with routinely? The young lady at the front was like a deer caught in headlights...and the manager was constantly handling complaints-but not seating anyone. If only the front would have called all people that had reservations to come later it would have helped. I am only sorry it soured our entire experience at the restaurant-we should have taken the lead of others who left to go to Odeon down the street...never again.",1
4762,490,5,1/6/2010,"Great food, excellent service, classy digs. Â My only tiny complaint was the frequency of bread service. Â ""Would you like some bread"" is my new favorite catch phrase. Â Apple room was pretty cool.",1
4763,490,4,12/30/2009,"I went to Bouley for a holiday lunch and decided on the tasting menu. Â The food was excellent from start to finish. Â It was a beautiful, sensory experience; apples in the entrance way and the complimentary loaf of lemon bread for each of us were an especially nice touch. Â So why only four stars? Â The service was sporadic. Â  Our waiter was delightful, but there were a slew of other wait staff who alternated between stony faced and monosyllabic when I asked questions. Â I also got the distinct impression that they were trying to turn our table within 1.5 hours, which is a little tough if you're trying to actually savor a five course meal.",1
4764,490,2,12/29/2009,"A celebratory dinner for four in an attractive room; despite hordes of servers standing around service was very slow and bread and water had to be requested repeatedly. There were three kinds of bread - all good- but where was the traditional offering of half a dozen varieties? People were very sweet and pleasant but you could starve between courses. Food good but portions tiny and both my courses served lukewarm not hot; I tasted other dishes including lamb (OK) and the famous porcini flan which was strange, more like an Asian soup. Dessert was fine; freebies included the ubiquitous squash soup and a wonderful concord grape sorbet plus some mediocre cookies and candy at the end. i have eaten spectacular meals at the old Bouley when the master was in the kitchen. this was not one of them. Maybe one has to have the tasting menu. Also there was no free goody given out at the end and the waiting area was jammed, showing that the hype (which after all got me there) still works.",1
4765,490,4,12/28/2009,"Well, we thought it was a good idea. My husband, our two college-age daughers and I decided that eating at a first class restaurant for Chrismas was just the ticket. So upon perusing Open Table,I discovered that Bouley was really our only option, as so many places were closed. I was excited to score a 5 pm reservation -- perfect!! So on Christmas Day,we got all dolled-up and headed to Bouley. I hadn't been to the new location, and was suprised and dismayed by the layout. Upon entering, you hit the coat check desk and walls of apples -- the Bouley signature. Then you are escorted into a narrow, awkward space called the Lounge, but what my husband referred to --a fter sitting there for 25 mintues without a glass of champagne or any attention -- Purgatory. It was a holding pen for diners as they waitied -- and waited! -- for their tables. We arrived to get the last table, and then an onslaught of people arrived, with no hostess or anything. They were all jammed into the coat check/hostess stand area for the 20 minutes we were wating -- with no one even there to check them in!!!! It was preposterous -- hordes of well-heeled folks just crowded together, like cattle. Inexcusable! Luckily we were finally shepherded downstairs to our table, which the harried hostess (finally!) referred to as ""The Dungeon."" My husband called it Siberia! It was too bright, too sterile and too not-cool for our standards, as opposed to the more important people seated upstairs int he warm and convivial dining area. Oh well. Serivce was okay -- frazzled but fairly attentive. But once they turned the lights down, and our cocktails kicked in, we actually started to enjoy it. The reason? The food! It was fantastic -- a five course menu with wonderful wines. Not too much, not too little. All seamlessly created and delicious. We all soon felt happy and warmed by the wine and wonderful flavors -- good. Christmas Day was not all that bad after all -- and either was Bouley. Would we go back? Maybe -- but definitely would not sit in the basement ever, ever again!",1
4766,490,4,12/26/2009,"Took my fiance to Bouley for her birthday and she described the night as magical. Maybe it was the apples in the entryway. I dunno, I'm a cynic and I liked the food but perhaps the servers were a little too attentive and fussy. We received a number of complimentary dishes from the kitchen and take-home lemony bread after dinner. We had actually left the restaurant already but a nice young lady chased after us to hand us a little bag of lemon-bread. The space is comfortable and the noise level during dinner is acceptable. I thought it was odd that Bouley's men's bathroom was leaking but maybe it's fixed now.",1
4767,490,5,12/24/2009,"This was probably the best dining experience in my life. If I could give 6 stars to this place I would. I must say I don't go eating out that often, but when I do I try to find a special place to visit. This was by far the best so far. Went there last night and even though we were seated downstairs (when making a reservation make sure to request to sit upstairs on the first floor by the fireplace), the food, the service, the atmosphere, and the wine were fabulous. We ordered regular tasting menu with wine pairing. 6 course meal was out of this world. I tried to keep notes on the food and wine but gave up quickly since it took away from enjoying the moment and the meal. Here are highlights: - Porcini Flan - nothing I ever tasted was so good. Crab meat was just perfect - flaky, smooth texture went down in perfect harmony with truffles. My wife didn't enjoy flan on the bottom but I thought it completed the picture flawlessly. - Organic Connecticut Farm Egg - I still can't describe how good it was. Simple to the core, the dish was absolutely brilliantly executed. - Rack of Lamb that I had and Duckling my wife had were top notch. Again, simple but impeccably executed. And lastly, in order to give desert its due justice I would need to spend days writing about it. Due to lack of time I just have to say WOW. It was amazing. We left the place barely able to move we were so stuffed with such good quality food that even this morning I couldn't eat anything to try to prolong the feeling of food ecstasy. One last point on the service - it was first class. Wine steward realizing that I knew a certain wine, offered me to try something completely different that wasn't supposed to be included and it was great. She also gave us extra glasses of wine to try on the house. The rest of the staff was very attentive and not annoying at all. All in all David Bouley deserves all the accolades and more for a brilliant meal I had last night.",1
4768,490,5,12/21/2009,"Yummm. Â What else can I say? It's in my NYC Top Five. Love the apples in the entrance and the spacious and comfortable dining room. The porcini flan is a must-have. The apple martinis are deliciously different. While it's hard for a French chef to top Le Bernardin's Eric Ripert for seafood, David Bouley makes a very good effort. The tuna sashimi is fantastic. (And unlike some celeb chefs, he is around in the kitchen - I've seen him.) Try to not eat the entire pound cake they send home with you in one sitting.",1
4769,490,2,12/15/2009,"I try to put in some extra thought to a restaurant when I go to New York from Philly because I like to think that all of the hype is worth the big price, but after this experience my girlfriend and I decided we would rather go to a taco stand and save our money for something more worth the experience. Â The restaurant was very elegant at entrance, the table and silver, very nice; waiter, snobby as expected. Â The begining of the meal seamed to be promising. Â  First courses where nice, especially liked the porcini flan. Â When the entrees where about to come out, my girlfriend had to use the restroom, and while she was gone they brought both of our entrees to the table. Â After realizing she wasn't there, the food runner brought a cover for her dish but left mine sitting there while I waited. Â Then somebody realized the mistake and came and covered my food while I waited. Â When she returned, less than 2 minutes, we began to eat but both of our dishes but they where both very cold so we returned them. Â They took the dishes and brought them back after I assume putting the whole thing into the oven, plate and all I assume since the plate left a grease ring on the tablecloth. Â Then when we tried to eat it again, it just recieved some surface heat but both where cold in the middle. Â So the waiter, trying not to show his irritation (which he didn't do a very good job of) snatched the dishes and took the dishes back and said that he would bring two new dishes. Â Finally they came out and he made a big drama about ""watch out these are so hot!!!"", but by this time we had finished our bottle of wine and not wanting to spend anymore money there we ate our ""fine dining"" entrees with New York tap water. Â Some of the wait staff understood the situation and was very nice, and brought us some complimentary desserts. Â  Also the lamb I had for dinner, I am sure that the chefs there have been working hard all day prepping the micro vegetables, the tedious puree's, and the gallons and gallons of stock reduced to a perfect sauce, but the lamb kabob I had the next day at Berket Turkish food on Houston st. for 7 bucks destroyed the flavor and textures that Bouley tried to offer. Â I am sorry but this food is not about the customer but more about the chefs need to show off his extensive knowledge. Before you finish this review, please understand I am not a food snob. Â I don't need to be treated like royalty or am I a picky foodie, but when I am attending a restaurant that puts themselves at this caliber and charges these prices I want everything to be perfect.",1
4770,490,5,12/13/2009,"Every aspect of our evening was wonderful. The staff was personable and attentive, the room gorgeous, and the food was infused with flavors that were rich, yet subtle. I could describe the food, but why... try it. It will be some of the most creative you've had",1
4771,490,1,12/2/2009,"Very disappointed with the last visit and will not be returning. Â I have been here ~1-2 times/year for the last 3. Â In 2006-2007 I found it to be a wonderful restaurant; top notch execution on everything. Â A visit in late 2008 was disappointng, menu less inspired and food preparation quite mediocre. Â I was not planning to return, but was given a $1,000.00 gift credit for Bouley, and so planned to use it for this past Thanksgiving. Â My credit was past the expiration date, but I had expected some consideration for this, because of the cash amount, and because Bouley was once a high-end business (this is not an issue at such businesses as Jean Georges, LV, St. Regis, etc.). Â The GM stood over my table for 5 minutes talking about how it was against their policy to accept it, and she would not return it. Â She promised something to make up for it. Â  The food was fine, but for a chef's tasting menu in a restaurant that is more than $80/person, it was the least impressive I have had in years. Â 4/5 dishes could have been had anywhere in the EV. Â I can't even recall exact dishes, but the amuse and steak were pretty tasteless. Â The ""best"" dish we had was a crab flan, because it was generous on the crab and of interesting consistency but otherwise just buttery. Â It was a special menu, so perhaps the regular current menu isn't so disappointing, but from my past few experiences I would not waste the time to find out. Â  Wine pairings were great; the only redeeming factor of the entire experience. Â Service was fine; I would rate 3 out of 5 for what I would expect. Â Considering the GM's service, a 0. Â We were then given a creme brulee at the end, to make up for not being able to use the $1,000.00 credit. Â It was comical at best. All in all, the worst supposedly higher-end restaurant experience I have had. Â For the amount of money we spent I wish we went to Grammercy Tavern, EMP, Corton, or many many others. Â Considering what it used to be, it is sad to see its gradual demise from exceptional to overpriced mediocrity. Â At least they still have the apple foyer. Â I will not return.",1
4772,490,5,12/1/2009,"Either I've been slumming it for a while and am easily impressed or this is truly an outstanding restaurant. Â I like to believe that the latter is more true. Â Went for the 5 course lunch tasting menu and was in heaven after the first dish. Â I love the flan with dungeoness crab, soooo tasty! Â And the duck, perfection. Â Dessert, omg, yummy! Â The staff was great, courteous, on point each time but not overbearing. Â Even the restroom deserves a mention. Â All I know was when lunch was over, I couldn't stop rubbing my belly and smiling the rest of the day. Â Ladies, it was worth every single bad calorie.",1
4773,490,5,11/29/2009,"Now, this is where I've had the best lunch ever!! Â It used to be the Wente Vineyards restaurant, but now this is my #1 lunch spot....for gourmet food that is. Â I'm so happy that my cousin recommended this place, specifically for lunch, as I would have never stopped by on my recent trip to NYC if she didn't mention it. My husband and I made reservations for lunch here on a Monday. Â It was hard to find this place, compared to their bakery, as the front sign was not too big. Â Once we walked in, the entryway was full of fresh apples on what seemed like wall book shelves that stretched from the bottom to the ceiling. Â We found out later that it was to provide aroma. Â  Of course, we went for the tasting menu which seemed to be the popular choice amongst all the other guests sitting around us. Â For $48, it's well worth it. Â You have a choice between 2-3 dishes per course. Â I thought it was ridiculously cheap for the quality of food and efforts that went into each dish. Â I don't think you can find a place that charges this kind of price for this kind of quality food in California. For the first dish, I had the Porcini Flan which came in a cute little copper pot filled with luscious amounts of dungeness crab meat in black truffle dashi. Â HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Â I made sure to savour every bite and my husband was getting annoyed that I kept saying ""mmm"" after every sip/bite. Â For the next dish, I had the skate (fish) with asparagus and lima beans. Â The fish was nicely cooked, like it was poached. Â For the main dish, I had the striploin steak. Â Cooked medium rare to my liking. Â The server also brought out a puree of fingerling mashed potatoes compliments of the chef. Â After the main dish, we had berry sorbet for palette cleansing, but it was a little too tart for me. Â Finally, the dessert....I chose the hot Valrhona chocolate souffle with maple and vanilla ice cream and chocolate sorbet. Â The chocolate sorbet was so rich in flavor that it was hard to believe that it was a sorbet. Â After the dessert, there was more.....tray full of petit fours. Â We were in a rush to get back to the hotel for our airport shuttle pick up that we had to kindly ask them to pack our petit fours to go. Â  Service was top notch. Â The server was constantly bringing out new utensils depending on what dish we were having. Â Refills of drinks were constantly replenished. Â The bread server brought out different types of bread. Â On the way out, the hostess each gave us a lemon loaf to take home. Â What a treat this was! Â  A note from me...don't forget to dress up a little. Â We felt guilty for going in with jeans. Â Didn't really look at the attire requirements ahead of time. Â Better to go in at least a business casual attire.",1
4774,490,5,11/9/2009,"I didn't even quite know how to start reviewing this. I was struggling between a 4 and a 5 because while this was an awesome experience, it wasn't L'Atelier. BUT! On its own, it's deserving of 5 stars, so I wasn't going to rob it of that one star. I sneaked out of work on a Friday so that I could try their prix-fixe lunch menu, and it was SO worth every bit of the money. I see that some people thought this place was stuffy. Ok, I get it. I know why you may think that way. I was dressed up that day for a concert at Carnegie Hall and I wanted to put the occasion to good use (I don't usually don fancy dresses). I think you should dress well for this place anyway, to show respect for the food and setting. It was kind of a spur of the moment thing, but I succeeded in booking a table on opentable. My friend met me there and the first thing that hit me was the greeting area, which was decorated with a room filled with shelves of APPLES. Gorgeous, sweet smelling apples! Although (I admit) the first thing that came across my mind was: it's kind of wasteful) I have to say I was really impressed with the setting so far. The dining room has soaring vaulted ceilings with beautiful paintings and tasteful decor. Ok, so the age difference between my group and the other diners was... er... a stretch, but hey, the service we got was exactly the same. It's really whether or not YOU feel comfortable in this setting (and I admit, for a little while I did feel sort of weird, then I got over myself). My friend and I both had the Dungeness Crab, Black Truffle Dashi. OMG... it was so good! Sometimes I feel overwhelmed by French food, but this was decadent, yet not overly so. Then we ordered the rouget and skate and they were both excellent. I preferred the skate simply because it was so smooth and just gently slid down my throat, but the rouget was very well cooked too. For main course my friend had the chicken and I had the duck (I can't resist anything with truffles), both were tender yet cooked well, tasty yet not overwhelming, and just the right portion, because after the palate cleanser (we had pear soup instead of coconut soup), there was still dessert... and dessert... and DESSERT! They not only gave us the normal dessert (passion fruit mousse?), but also a 3 decker set with... just a lot of sweets, a 2 decker set with chocolates cookies and truffles, AND they just casually randomly handed us a massive creme brulee and said ""we thought you might enjoy this."" WOW! Needless to say, we did not finish everything. I did not expect that there would be so much food and that everything would be so delicious. So forget ""feeling weird"" or don't even consider the supposed ""stuffiness""... it doesn't matter! You'll definitely enjoy this meal and you'll get service that matches up to the food!",1
4775,490,5,11/9/2009,"The five course tasting menu for lunch at $48 -- yes, only 48 bucks! -- is one of the best values in the city. Â What a great way to eat at one of New York City's best restaurants for not a lot of money. The occasion -- my wife's 35th birthday and our first escape from the baby. Â We chose Bouley because it serves a proper lunch, not brunch, on Sundays. We arrived at noon on a Sunday and found the place mostly empty. Â We were seated in the main dining room, which is made up with vaulted ceilings to look like the inside of a Romanesque building in southern France. Â We were seated side-by-side at a banquet table for four so that we could look out over the room while we ate. Â Other couples who came in after us were seated in the same way. Â It makes for a very intimate dining experience -- easy to talk to each other quietly, to hold hands under the table, and to look out at the beautiful room while we enjoyed our meal. We each chose the tasting menu. Â I started with tuna sashimi, which was delectable, and my wife had the porcini flan. Â As good as my tuna was, my wife won that round, as the porcini flan was incredible. Next, I had grilled rouget and my wife had skate. Â Both wonderful. Â A draw. For the main course, I had the ""striploin"" steak, medium rare and my wife had the duckling. Â The steak was done perfectly, two morsels of beef upon a puree of fingerling potatoes. Â But, once again my wife had the better of me with the succulent duckling. The fourth course was a berry sorbet, which we both agreed was about the best sorbet we'd ever had. The last and final course was dessert, and we both had the chocolate souffle. Â This was served with three kinds of ice cream -- chocolate, vanilla and maple -- which perfectly complemented the hot souffle. Â We also had coffees, which came with chocolates and cookies. Were this not enough, there had been some delay between the first and second courses, and although we never said anything about it, we were given a complimentary creme brulee along with our desserts. Â We really appreciated the gesture, which was very classy considering that we never complained, and they never said why they were giving us the extra dessert -- but all sides knew exactly what was going on. Â I am a big creme brulee fan, and this was the best creme brulee I had ever had -- delicately crispy crust and a not-too-sweet custard inside. Finally, when we left, the hostess gave us each a lemon loaf from Bouley Bakery. Â Another nice touch. Over all, the food and the service was terrific. Â The staff was attentive and friendly, the food was great, the decor was beautiful, and the entire experience made our first date away from the baby a memorable one.",1

Â  So in I walked for Â the lunch tasting menu and even though I was by myself reading Michael Lewis' Money Ball, the waitstaff treated me just like anyone else. Â Great space, delicious food and multiple desserts at lunch (complimentary food to a lone clearly out of place diner)? Â A clear winner.

We were seated in a quiet spot toward the end of the restaurant. I'm not saying I am a fan but the food was just okay.

From the decadent lunch to the luxurious dinner, I've never had food, service, or an over all experience that matched the level of satisfaction I get at this establishment. Let's be honest: I can only afford to eat here when I'm not picking up the tab. But this is a place I'd gladly start saving $20 a week for MONTHS at a time just to have lunch or dinner here for one night. It would be worth every penny. They will feed you until you pop. The wait staff is professional, knowledgeable, honest. When we sat down, the first this we were asked is if we had any allergies. I don't think a waiter has ever been so concerned about their customers as to ask about allergies. We were then greeted with an incredible tomato amuse-bouche. We were then offered a variety of breads. The waiter helped my date with wine to go with his meal. I had a perfect Chopin martini. What to try: Porcini Flan (split this rich appetizer), The sashimi- quality tuna (my personal favorite), Oysters (they come with caviar!), The rack of Lamb. One other thing is the potato puree that comes with your meal is to die for. I've been trying to replicate it in my own kitchen with little success. In addition to the dessert, you'll also get a plate of cookies, sugars, candy. If I could eat here all the time I'd be as big as a house and wouldn't care one bit.",1
4779,490,5,10/16/2009,"I will have to say, that Bouley gave me one of the best dining experiences (if not the best) in America. Â Super professional/friendly staff, classy decor, and AWESOME food!! Â Nothing was a disappointment here. Â Every single bite of the food I had here gave me a WOW from amuse to desert. Â What made it even better were the complimentary dishes that I kept getting. Â The 5 course meal ended up being like 9 lol. One thing that really got me was the duck. Â Everything was great, but the duck...I've NEVER had a roasted duck dish that tasted this good in my life. Â It was hands down the best duck ever including all the French restaurants I've eaten at France. If your looking for a high-class dining experience in NYC, I will recommend this place.",1
4780,490,5,10/14/2009,"This was perhaps one of the most memorable experiences in my life! It started with walking into the foyer that was filled with the smell of apples lined against the wall. We had an early dinner reservation so as soon as we walked in, the tables were empty and 6 or 7 servers were standing among them, waiting to greet us. The ambiance is half of the unforgettable experience. It was warm and welcoming, not stiff and harsh. The details from the red velvety chairs to the marble floors to the soft lighting were unlike anything I had seen before. Our waiter was a knowledgeable, story-telling, passionate man... I could trust him completely to help us make our food and wine choices. I am extremely upset at myself that I cannot remember his name since he was an essential part of such a memorable night ... Anyways, I started out with a wine that our waiter recommended was similar to Reisling. It was the smoothest, cleanest wine I had ever had. I have never finished a glass of wine before. By the third course, my glass was empty. We decided to go with the 2-3 hour tasting menu. I had some of the most ingriguing food I've ever tasted. Through out the night they were offering all different types of breads from the Bouley Bakery. I had about 6 or 7 different types of bread...my favorite the flaxseed roll at the beginning of the meal and the roasted garlic bread that came around later. For me, while the courses were spectacular, the most memorable part was the pear soup w/ a berry granite & frozen yogurt and the desserts afterwards. I could eat the pear soup every day at the end of my meals. It was refreshing and not too sweet and did exactly what it was supposed to do-cleanse the palate. At the beginning of the night when I was choosing my picks off the menu, the waiter had accidentally mentioned creme brule and I inquired about it since it wasn't listed on the tasting menu. However, I didn't want to stray from what our options were so I chose the pear dessert. When our desserts came out, I was delighted to find out that they gave us a creme brule, ""compliments of the chef""!! Creme brule is perhaps one of my favorite decadent desserts...and I've had plenty in my day...but his was exemplary. The chocolate souflee was...almost indescribably heavenly. I had a bite of everything I could, even though I was ridiculously full and exhausted from eating...It's a day later and I cannot stop thinking about it. If you are someone who appreciates flavors and freshness and quality of food, as well as the details of how flavors are paired together...this is a spectacular place to go. We mused over how amazing a tiny micro-green could pack so much flavor...and how well it complimented the fish they placed it on. There are very few things that bring me to silence...where I don't want to hear a single word from any body because the food is just so amazing I need my full attention to appreciate it...and I felt that way here many, many times. As we left, they gave us a complimentary loaf of lemon something or other from their bakery. Excellent. They really cater to you. I am looking forward to another trip to Bouley, perhaps Upstairs or Bakery...or all three.",1
4781,490,5,10/9/2009,"Wow. Bouley. What can I say. The restaurant is like a hybrid between a French chateau and you rich jewish grandmothers living room. We disregarded the menu, and asked the chef to give us 13 courses with paired wine. I recommend this for foodies. We got 4 fish courses, 5 meat, 3 deserts and cheese course. All with the most amazing paired wine. one of their meat courses was a whole chicken cooked in a dough sealed glass container on a bed of alfalpha grass. Chicken cooked this way, dissolves on your tongue like sushi. HIghly recommend this fine French/American eating experience.",1
4782,490,5,10/6/2009,"Blown away. Â Truly a special occasion destination. I tried Bouley for the first time about 6 years ago, before their renovation, and I wasn't too impressed, never felt the need to return again on my own accord. Â I did go again 2 years ago for brunch and was again, unimpressed, thinking that the place was past its prime. Â By chance however, I went again this past weekend and this time I was really impressed by the food and the atmosphere. The space was very elegant but had a lot of its own character as well. Clearly, a lot of thought went into the design of the dining areas. Â Service was the only thing that wasn't perfect - it was very pleasant and friendly, but I felt it was a bit obstrusive, there were too many staff coming up to us too often, a fork would be forgotten here and there, some spilling of wine by the sommelier etc, just somehow not polished enough for a place like this. The food was totally delicious. Â It was fresh, clean, simple, full of flavors and thoughtful. Â I would definitely recommend going with the seafood dishes mostly. Â Some standouts from our evening were the pave of salmon, the sea urchin gelee and the porcini tart - all super flavorful and interesting. Overall, we paid $200 per person for the regular (ie non-chef) tasting menu, including 2 $100 bottles of wine among 4 people. Â It was a reasonable price considering the quality and quantity of food we had. Â I also liked the orange pound cake they gave us as take-homes - a practice they've been keeping for a while. Â I would definitely come back here again for another special occasion meal.",1
4783,490,3,10/5/2009,"My husband and I went on a random Saturday night, with no big celebration to hype up the expectation. Â We chose the tasting menu for $170/pp after quite a show by our waiter but against my better judgement. Â My first course of oysters was interesting - the oysters were plump, juicy, and perfectly briny, but the jello and caviar that accompanied made it taste fishy. Â The rest of the meal was average -- and three hours later when we had to beg for our tea and coffee, completely forgettable. Â Back Le Bernardin or River Cafe or the Grocery or Gotham.",1
4784,490,1,10/3/2009,"its not what it used to be thats for sure ! By the way, Bouley has FAILED several healtn inspections ( with flying colors) in both his restaurant and the bakery. Â CHECK WIKIPEDIA The prices are obscene as is the food. Â I find this place to be insulting. David Bouley, a Connecticut native, not at all French, prepares the same crap night after night. Â The desserts suck, especially those unmemorable petit fours and Â overly saccharine souffles Â which are nauseatingly sweet and that awful armagnac ice cream. Â (its truly vile). Â Shouldnt a place of this caliber hire a decent pastry chef? Â One would think so ! Â The service is lame as well. Â They will change your silverware 9000 times but will leave you without Â utensils Â as well and never change your napkin , Â not even once ! Â  Â Food has a tendency to come out cold and you will never see a decent vegetable on your plate. The portions are nouvelle (miniscule). Doesnt this guy know nouvelle cuisine went out in the late 70's? Â  If you opt to spend tons of wasted money on just Â  bread , then this is the place for you. Â i would rather find a decent boulangerie and get myself a good hot crusty baguette, a hunk of Â good cheese and a healthy portion of fish and some wonderful wine and stay home. They try to fill you up with all this bread so that you dont realize that there really is no food! If you didnt have the bread you would truly starve Â The portions are obscenely small and the prices are exorbitant.

4785,490,3,9/30/2009,"I had lunch at Bouley almost 20 years ago and remember it as one of the great meals of my life, so I went back for a second try yesterday hoping for something close to a repeat. Â Unfortunately, it just didn't happen. Â While Chloe at the reception stand was beautiful and charming, the rest of the experience was utterly forgettable. Â The room lacked the energy and buzz it had 20 years ago. Â Bored old frumpy rumpled rich people (I'm not that young myself but at least I can still walk without slumping and don't look like I'm in a daze), foreign tourists from God knows where with too much money to burn, and a service staff trying very hard to be perfect but many of them were tentative and awkward. Â The party next to me was one of the nouveau rich crowd, barely speaking English, and the waiter was clearly struggling to explain the intricacies of the menu and wine list, almost insisting they get a bottle of champagne since that would go with everything, Â while the guest kept asking ""do you have half bottles of rose?"" Â All would have been forgiven if the food had been exciting, but that was not to be. Â Nothing bad, but nothing terribly unique, not a single flavor or texture that I will remember even tomorrow. Â The best thing was probably dessert (the chocolate souffle), and although the portions of the rest of the tasting menu were small, perhaps they decided to make up for it by comping me a second dessert--an extra large and very good creme brulee. Â Just what I needed before flying back to SF where, Michael Bauer not withstanding, I would much rather eat at Commis.",1

4787,490,1,9/13/2009,"We made the mistake of eating here for Thanksgiving a few years ago. We were in NYC for our honeymoon, and our families were still hanging around after the ceremony so we thought it might be nice to do a high-end holiday celebration. What resulted was the absolute worst fine dining experience we had ever had. I wonder if our treatment was so bad because four members of our party of twelve could not make dinner (they were stuck in traffic on the NJ Turnpike)...nevertheless, we did give the restaurant advanced notice when it became apparent that they would be spending Thanksgiving dinner at a rest stop. The meal itself Â was very nondescript. There was butternut squash soup, some lobster, roast turkey, mashed potatoes, haricot vert, and a cranberry relish. The lobster, what little of it there was, was overcooked and rubbery. The turkey was as dry and tasteless as any institutionalized turkey you have ever had at school. What was remarkable was the abrupt and dismissive service. We were in and out of that place in little more than an hour!! Even though there were only eight of us, we still racked up a bill of more than $175 a head! After dinner, not all the ladies received the complimentary packaged pastry. The final insult was that we were not even allowed to wait around inside the doorway for a cab (they would not call one for us) even though it was raining outside! Despite also eating at Per Se and Babbo during this trip, Bouley turned out to be the meal we most remembered (only not in a good way). Mr. Bouley, a pox on your house!",1

This place definitely sticks with you.",1
4789,490,3,9/9/2009,"Bouley was a bit of a disappointment. Â The first time I went, on an expense account with a large group, we had an amazing meal. Â Really out of this world, with top-notch service. But when I went with my husband, hoping to replicate the experience, we were highly disappointed. Â The service was mediocre, even for a restaurant that is mid-priced. Â When paying a premium at a restaurant like Bouley, mediocre service can really derail the whole experience. Â That's more than half of what you're experiencing. Â Service was sloppy and inefficient. Â Water glasses went empty for periods of time, the wrong silverware was given to the wrong person, and more than once we had to search for our waiter, even though there were only 3 other tables. Â  The coursing was ridiculous, too. Â At times we waited 30-40 minutes between a course and sometimes just a few. Â A consistent pattern would have been appreciated, and also made the meal feel like less of a long time drag. Â I like being able to appreciate my meal and not feel rushed, but this felt choppy, not relaxed. Some of the food was excellent - the main meats were superb. Â The fish dishes were just okay. Â One of my pieces of trout was raw. Â Nobody came to check on our table, so I couldn't tell the waiter about it. Â By the time he came around, we were finished with the course and it would have been strange to tell him when he could no longer fix the mistake. Â Still, when there are 4 pieces of inch-long fish on the plate, at least make sure they are cooked. Â  Overall, I don't think we'll be back again. Â There are too many other fine restaurants to repeat a big miss.",1

4794,490,4,7/28/2009,"I don't know about the dinner, but the lunch tasting menu is a good value. For $48, I got: an intriguing little amuse bouche (salmon roe over some custardy thing); an appetizer: oysters and caviar (for me, this was the only dish that was a slightly off); a selection of freshly baked breads; a well-portioned first course: rainbow trout (grilled to perfection) over a bed of raw watercress (subtle flavor contrast); a show-stopping main course: duck (succulent and sweet and juicy and just wonderful); palette cleanser (raspberry sorbets); sophisticated dessert (a chocolate souffle that was moist and warm; decadent without becoming gaudy); three more tiers of petit fours and two more tiers of chocolates; and finally, a lemon cake to go. Â  The setting is lovely. I admire the interior decorator's innovative touches. Cool catacomb bathrooms. The waitstaff is attentive without being unctuous. Bottom line: while I wouldn't say that was the best meal of my life, it was very, very good. Elsewhere in the city, I've paid more (sadly), for much, much less.",1
4795,490,2,7/19/2009,"I plan a lot of business lunches, and loved the ""old"" Bouley for its unbeatable lunch menus. Â I finally got to try the new location. Â What a dissapointment! Â They seem to have spent all of their money on the decor (which is nice, but so was the old place) and are now out to recoup their expenses by reducing the quantity and quality of the food. Â The lunch tasting menu used to be a surreal experience -- every dish would be unique, and you got nearly full portions of an obscene number of wonderful dishes. Â  Now, the choices look good on the menu, but the result on the plate more often than not disappoints. Â In fact, out of the entire lunch tasting menu, the only truly excellent and unique dish I had was the first -- a porcini flan with crab meat, which made me think I was in for a great meal. Â I was wrong. Â The subsequent fish course looked like something out of a parody of a French restaurant -- tiny, tiny pieces of fish, which was just as well, because the dish was notably bland. Â I also had the duck, which was adequately tasty, but it was not remarkable, and it was probably less than 1/2 the size of the dishes at the old Bouley, even though the prices certainly haven't gone down. Also, the service used to be exceptional -- you could want for nothing without it already being anticipated by the very smooth restaurant staff. Now, service is merely good, par for the course at any decent restaurant in NYC. Â The Midwesterner in me feels snobby writing something like that, but when you (or your employers/clients) are paying these kinds of prices at a place with this kind of atmosphere, you expect more than ""good"" service. And, to avoid crying while I write this, I won't even get into the fact that THERE IS NO MORE BREAD CART!!! For this kind of money, you can eat lunch at a lot of great restaurants in this city. Â Bouley is no longer one of them.",1
4796,490,3,7/13/2009,"First off, let me say a friend of mine had built this place up to be THE BEST MEAL EVER. of course, it could never live up to what she had created in my mind. i had the lobster entree, which was delicious! very, very good, but also no better than many other restaurants i've been to in DC and New York. certainly not the best meal of my life, but very good. the dessert was good, too, but nothing to write home about. The service was excellent, and delivered with a sense of humor, which was fun. The place is formal, but there's a sense of playfulness-it's not stuffy. I love the wall of apples when you walk in-the smell was divine. The bathroom was awesome-it was like being in a castle. All in all, if I was in the area and with someone who wanted to go back to Bouley, I would go, but I probably wouldn't initiate a return with so many good restaurants to try in NY.",1

Â Pretty big mistake by Bouley if these reviews are correct --------------------------------------------------Â­------------------------------------ Any restaurant that pushes around a cart of bread with about 10 different varieties is the place for me. Â  Bread cart...where have you been all my life. Â I will come back to this restaurant just for you! Dinner was also delicious. Â The atmosphere was a little formal and stuffy, but you forget about that once you start eating your dinner. Â The bakery is also great because you can buy the Bouley breads and other french treats.",1
4799,490,5,6/29/2009,"Bouley in my opinion is excellent. From the smell of the apples in the entrance vestibule, which sets your mouth to watering, to the nicely decorated restaurant it is all about the diners pleasure. I read the Yelp reviews before going so I was a bit worried about how the meal would go. I think many of the criticisms are wrong. Most French restaurants give small servings. Most good NYC restaurants are pricey. However even here I think Bouley sets itself apart. I had the Tasting menu, a six course dinner, for $95. While this may seem expensive there are dozens of places in NYC more expensive and of lesser quality. Â  Â  Â One interesting note is that for a French restaurant there is no heavy saucing. The meals are lighter and asian inspired. The meal for me started with the Porcini Flan a mixture of Dungeoness crab, truffle which was fantastic. Next came the organic Connecticut farm egg. I usually find this type of naming pretentious and usually a let down. More marketing and less food orientated. This was fantastic. I love eggs and this one was cooked perfectly and the coconut-garlic foam it was served in was very tasty. If I had a cook they would make this every day for breakfast. The next course, Loster was fine. Not overcooked with a light tasty sauce. Â  Next came duck which was very good. The accompanyment was ok, I don't remember what is was. Next was supposed to be cocnut soup but instead sorbet was served. No reason for the switch was given but the sorbet was good. The pear dessert was excellent. I am not a dessert person and I ate the whole thing. Â  Â The service was excellent and the waiter did a very good job of helping people in the party who had dietary restrictions. The wine added to the main entry was excellent. Â  Â I think the best rating for Bouley would be 4.5 but since we have to pick whole stars 5 is warranted since they did an excellent job in service, food and customer care.",1

4801,490,3,6/25/2009,"What disappointment Bouley was! The dishes are absolutely minuscule, flavors are boring, and food is NOT french. I love French food, but Bouley has the most boring menu I've seen at a French restaurant. Every dish lacked any other vegetables than some obscure greens and bock choy, which is ASIAN btw. Bouche amusee was barely passable (although free). My dining companion ordered lamb shank and it came in 3 tiniest pieces OFF THE BONE. This is lamb shank! Shank usually means there's a bone involved. I ordered cod, and it was nothing spectacular, although tasty, not worth the price. Sure, the chef gives you a whole bunch of free stuff, but he better with prices Bouley charges and the portion it gives you. Dessert and wine choices are the only reasons I didn't give this place 2 starts. One thing that Bouley could get right was creme brulee. It was creamy and delicious. This place is way too expensive for what you get. I am not coming back, neither would I recommend it to any of my friends.",1
4802,490,4,6/18/2009,"So, the four months worth of deal activity (whereby I was worked to within an inch of my sanity on numerous occasions) was probably not a worthwhile trade-off for the free lunch I got here, but, even for $48.00, the tasting menu is really quite something. Â  We began with a chef's amuse of cauliflower mousse, salmon roe, truffle oil, and tomato coulis, before launching into the prix fixe selections starting with porcini flan, dungeness crab and truffle oil. Â The crab was layered delicately throughout, but it was the truffle oil which really carried the flavor of this dish and subtlely cut the natural earthiness of the porcini. Â  For the seafood dish, I opted for the skate with peas and (if I recall) roast garlic. Â Bouley's rendition had a perfect juiciness to it that made one of our diners second-guess every piece of skate he had thrown back into the water whenever he went fishing. Â  For the main dish, I went with the Cooperstown First of the Season Baby Spring Lamb, which was served with a black mint puree, roasted garlic shoots, and Hurley Mountain Chive Fingerling Potatee puree. Â The latter two elements paired deliciously. Â It took several bites of the lamb for the various flavor points to draw together but my lasting impression was one of thorougoing savoriness (minus the mint puree, which was strangely reminiscient of roast beets). Â  The menu promised coconut soup as a pallet-cleanser, but instead (and perhaps to our benefit) we got the refreshing local strawberry and rhubarb parfait, served with yogurst and raspberry sorbet and strawberry granite. Â Nothing cleanses the pallet quite like a sorbet of summer fruits and this dish more than did the trick. Â  For the dessert, I chose the chocolate souffle which came paired with vanilla, dark chocolate, and coffee ice creams. Â Pedestrians as these flavours may sound, the chocolate (which may, in fact, have been vahlrona) had to be the darkest I'd ever tasted in ice cream form while the vanilla tasted like it had been brought in fresh from Madasgascar this morning. Â As for the souffle itself . . . well, of course there's no way to eat a chocolate souffle without creating a huge mess. Â Bouley's variety does not distinguish itself in this regard but it was a profoundly decadent capstone to a flawless six course meal. Â Dessert comes accompanied with towers of petit-fours, macarons, and other assorted french delicacies. Â  The interior is not for everyone (it certainly wasn't for me). Â You are greated whimsically at first with an anteroom bedecked with shelves full of apples. Â Fresh as an orchard, this space evokes much of the terroir sensibilities you see carried out on the menu. Â However, the rest of the interior space just seems heavy-handedly baroque (including the bathroom, which people rant and rave about) and tacky. Â But this, of course, is a matter of taste and wont distract at all from the overall dining experience (which certainly wasn't hurt by the fact that I didn't have to pay for any of it).",1
4803,490,5,6/5/2009,"What I loved and respected most about Bouley was the ability to stand outside and look through the window directly into the kitchen. Â There, standing out with his shock of white hair, was Bouley himself. Â He's STILL cooking in his own kitchen, which shouldn't be a surprise, but when you consider how many celebrity chefs have hung up their toques to bask in the attention, I felt a deep sense of respect for Bouley and his establishment. Our expectations were extremely high for Bouley, having dined at his restaurant almost 10 years ago when it was in its other, other location. Â Is the new location an improvement? Â It has some very nice touches (floor to ceiling rows of apples in the entryway), and some eccentricities (giant velvet picture frames...uhh tacky) that make it, if nothing else, a unique experience. Â The quality of the food is as it was years ago - excellent. Â There were some truly exceptional items on the menu, and a couple that, while good, weren't all that. Â Only one item, which I'll discuss later, was a disappointment. Â  Service: French, mostly. Â We arrived late, and as punishment, were waiting nearly an hour for our table. Â Whoops. Â They were somewhat unapologetic, but once seated, we loved our servers. Â They were extremely attentive, professional, humorous, and offered fantastic recommendations. Â I was undecided about whether to dock them a star for the delay faux pas, but by the end of the meal, I was won over by their staff, and let it slide. The menus offered were a la carte, a tasting menu, and a chef's tasting menu. We opted for the tasting menu - six courses, and clocking in at 2 hours, non-stop. Â The chef's menu, 8 courses, according to our server, would take 3 hours. Â  Exceptional fare: - Seared foie gras. Â Whoa. Â Bouley makes his own, and our waiter described the process of hanging the torchon, twisting it, allowing the brine/sherry to break down the cells and allowing the fat to settle. Â He also described it as a 5,000 calorie bomb, so naturally, I licked the plate clean. Afterward, I felt fat. Â And sassy. - The porcini flan with Dungeness crab and black truffle dashi. Â This was fan-friggin-tastic. Â The truffle scent combined with the dashi gave this the perfect (and I do mean perfect) waft of intense aromas and flavors. Â The crab is a perfect compliment, mixing seamlessly and beautifully with the flan. Â I mopped every last dripping morsel with bread. Then, I licked the copper tin that it came in. Â Bad form? Â Probably, but it really couldn't be helped. - The farm fresh egg with Serrano ham, cheese (pecorino, I think?), white truffle, and creamy polenta deserves every. last. drop. of praise that it receives from reviews. Â I mopped the plate clean with my...damn, no bread. Â Ok, more tongue, and evil glances from the snooty lady sitting at the table next to us. - Maine lobster isn't an innovative addition to menus (a bit overdone, if you ask me), but damn if Bouley doesn't cook it better than the vast majority of lesser restaurants. Â It was served in a sublime pinot noir reduction, and I mopped the plate clean. (Yes, mostly tongue.) - Duck (yum - more licking); rack of lamb (murmur, mumble, lick, lick); and dessert? Â Sweet Jesus - an apple torte with licorice and vanilla ice cream. (groan, must...keep...licking). Not so great: - Scottish salmon was a bit dry and overcooked, and the consistency was off, primarily because of something that was coated on the outside to give it a crunchy texture, which added to the dry factor. Â This dish was not a hit. - Monk fish chop suey. Â The taste was decent - again, monk fish cooked beautifully - but the sauce had a consistency that reminded/hinted/echoed what you'd get from cheap Chinese take-out. It wasn't as much of a miss as the salmon, but it wasn't a home run either. A quick word about the funky interior: As a waiter explained to us, every detail of the interior design was done by Bouley himself. Â The stone/tile in the floor was taken from a quarry in France; the chairs were sized and selected from multiple iterations; the lamp shades hand selected...you get the idea. Â One nice effect from the interior is that high ceilings, fabrics and soft lighting create quite an ambiance (and if you're 6 ft or taller, the velvet picture frames make for a cushy head rest). Â There's a back room, with dimmer lighting, and a private table for at least a dozen people located in the basement, on the way to the restrooms. Â The downstairs was much more tasteful, and reminiscent of a French chateau. Â  We came; we supped; and there was much rejoicing. Â I feel for the Yelpers who didn't have a positive experience. Without overindulging (with three diners, we could choose virtually every item from the tasting menu) I can definitely see how you could strike out, but what Bouley does well, he does exceptionally well, and for still being the chef in his kitchen, he wins major props.",1
4804,490,2,6/5/2009,"My high expectations for Bouley were not met. The food was subpar, service was just ok, and the decor/atmosphere was too stuffy for my taste. Nothing really stood out, maybe the wine selection? Â Take your money elsewhere!",1
4805,490,3,5/31/2009,"3.5 stars. Great prix fixe lunch for $50? Bouley it is! -0.5 stars for the snooty service. -1.5 star for the decor. Is it just me or did it have a very UES vibe to it? Well, maybe if the entire UES was on hallucinogens. On second thought, only -1 star for decor.",1
4806,490,5,5/19/2009,"Transcendant! I was here for a wedding 6 course dinner, and they certainly take perfection very seriously . Snow pea and snow crap soup. The use of tarragon and saffron! The omnipresent lobster! The lavender and vanilla infused lamb. The molten chocolate, the banana marzipan wedding cake. The warm address from the twinkley-eyed David Bouley himself. I was swooning from more than Chateau Margaux by the end of the evening. But to take respite from the cavernous acoustics of the wine cellar, the restrooms are sexy boudoir style. Bouley makes me rethink all other star ratings bestowed to restaurants. This was *beyond*.",1
2823,490,3,5/18/2009,"It's fancy. Â That's about it. Â They have a good wine selection. Â I don't think I'd go back here for the tasting menu, maybe their a la carte menu items are better. Â It was a good one time experience, it is just too expensive and not good enough to come back. Â  We were seated at one of the middle tables and the staff and guests were constantly bumping into our chairs. Â That was irritating. Â They messed up on our order, which was ok since they brought us out what we actually ordered and let us keep the other item. Â They were too quick to pick up our plates and even the person in charge of orchestrating the plate pick ups/drop offs was bothered by the staff (who ""has been here six months already..."" but still messed up the service).",1
4807,490,3,5/11/2009,"Still a good meal, but not the life-changing experience I had thought it was when I was young and green. After coming here over the years, I've ultimately come to the conclusion that the food is pretty consistently good-to-very good, the atmosphere and decor excellent, and the service...acceptable. I took my mom here for Mother's Day yesterday, and although the pace was rather frenzied (as may be expected on such an occasion), the service was still a little brusque - and that is not a word I like to use to describe service in any establishment, whether the corner diner for chicken noodle soup or Bouley for porcini flan. If I'm spending $100+ per head on lunch, then I would like it to come with some graciousness on the side, s'il vous plait. Additionally, at their new location, they no longer offer a full selection off their bread cart. As such, nooooo saffron walnut bread in sight. That's a negatory, ghostrider. This place will continue to be on my list of destinations, however, because their lunch tasting menu is (a) an excellent value (like Jean-Georges) and (b) offered on the weekends (UNlike Jean-Georges). Thus, the conclusion is weekday lunch = JG, and weekend lunch = Bouley. Â Unless you have another destination in mind? I'm open to suggestions.",1
4808,490,4,5/10/2009,"I came here with MOM for Mother's day. From the real apples that decorate the entrance, to the french style bathroom, the decor is very detailed and almost distracting of the food and conversation (this can be good or bad...). We had the 5 course pre-fix menu and the food was what I expected -very good. However, it was just very good. I will probably not remember what I ate one week from today... The whole experience was great, with excellent french service (don't expect many smiles or kindness). Â  The food itself does not justify coming here again, which I may or may not. TIPS- Visit the bathroom If you are crazy about Coffee have the expresso If you like chocolate, have the chocolate dessert.",1
4809,490,5,4/13/2009,Deserving of 3 Michelin Stars instead of 2. Â The new dining room is beautiful.,1
4810,490,4,3/30/2009,"The dining room at Bouley is stunning, and the food (especially the desserts) is very good. I would rather it had been the other way round. There were small irritations that let down the experience; the kamamoto oyster starter was tiny (more like an amuse-bouche) and the delicacy of the flavour was underwhelming; the Chatham cod main course was delicious but only just warm enough; the vegetable side order was delivered halfway through our main course and in incongruous cheap-looking glass dishes; the music being played was probably entitled ""Four or five of the best well-known classics"", and we were fed up of them by the end of the evening. Overall - a very good but not great experience.",1
4811,490,4,3/29/2009,"Really great food for a special occasion. Â It's a bit harsh on the wallet, but worth it. Â Each dish is delicately prepared and presented - all high-quality ingredients. Â The ambience is a bit like ""old ladies luncheon,"" so not exactly the place for a trendy night out, but if you need a classy place for a business meal (or to bring the folks), this is the place.",1
4812,490,5,3/10/2009,"As it turns out, you can go home again. Â I came with some trepidation: Â I had been to the old Bouley many many times. Â It was the finest restaurant in which I had ever eaten. Â I was concerned that the new incarnation would not match my memories of the old restaurant. Â Wrong. Â It was as magnificent as ever. The room is deeply reminiscent of the old restaurant. Â Apples at the front door, vaulted ceiling, small flowers on each table with large sprays on side tables. Â I sat in the front room, but there was a back room and downstairs there are private dining rooms. Had the tasting menu. Â The amuse was cauliflower with passion fruit and tomato jus (a traditional Bouley touch). Â Started with an unctuous porcini/truffle flan with crab. Then had the Chatham monkfish, which was tender and rich. Â Then had the duck with Romesco and fava beans. Â Then the coconut soup. Â Tasted all of my companions' dishes as well. Â Each flavor was crisp and distinct. Â  I am embarrassed to admit that I then had to run (2.5 hours into the meal), leaving my companions to eat the desserts, which they gloatingly described as fabulous. Service was perfect. Â Price value was also perfect. Â Run, before it disappears again.",1
4813,490,5,3/2/2009,"I visited Bouley in the spring of last year, and it blew me away. Â The experience so tantalized my tastebuds that I took note of every dish I consumed. Having read about their amazing prix fixe lunch, I made a reservation for one shortly after they opened so I could enjoy a leisurely meal. The first thing that you experience when you open the heavy outer door is the flowery scent of fresh red apples. Â The scent both cleanses and tantalizes your olfactory sense, acting as a sensory amuse bouche to the meal. Service is impeccable, courteous and professional. Â Several waiters seamlessly served me throughout the course of the meal, and each politely described the course before leaving me to taste it. A crisp glass of white wine accompanied me through the meal. The first course was delicate: Phyllo crusted Florida Shrimp, Baby Squid, Cape Cod Sea Scallop, and Sweet Maryland Crabmeat in an Ocean Herbal Broth. Â The broth was warm with the right amount of saltiness, each fresh, sweet miniature piece of seafood cooked to perfection. Â I liked that the broth remained light and not overly manipulated so you tasted the natural flavor of each seafood item. The second course was comforting, familiar yet different: Wild King Salmon with Morels The salmon skin was crisp and salty, almost carmelized, and the spongy morel mushrooms with it's earthiness were a delicious accompaniment. Â The flesh of the nicely fatty salmon was perfectly done, flaking when raked over with a fork. The third course was sublimely comforting: Line Caught Chatham Cod in a Black Truffle Dashi The chatham cod was, in a word, beautiful. Â It's soft white flesh was like butter, which melted on my tongue. The cod was nestled in a truffle broth which was generously flecked with pepper. Â Though hot, it was surprisingly refreshing. Â By the end of this dish, I was giddy from all the delicious food. The fourth course was earthy and heady: Organic Connecticut Farm-Raised Baby Pig with Ramp Risotto After the cod, I didn't think it could get better. Â I was wrong. This had to be the best pork I've ever tasted. Â It was heady, slightly gamey, utterly rich and pulled apart easily with fork. Â The pork skin was amazingly crisped, and it had a distinct taste all it's own. Â It was almost as if it had been cooked or caramelized with orange essence or rind, a subtle citrus in the background of the richness of the pork. Â The ramp risotto was perfectly al dente and salty, the smear of date cippolini puree was rich, sweet and delicately spiced. Â By comparison, the mushrooms and baby asparagus were bland but that was the genius part; the dish would have been overwhelming if they had also been finessed. Â The accomanying side of creamy mashed potatoes were not fluffy as if they had been processed in a food mill or a ricer, but chewy, almost like taffy. This is the point at which I thought my palate had been devastated. Â Then the desserts came. It started off innocently enough with a passion fruit coconut pineapple granita. The pineapple granita was slightly honeyed with nice ice crystal, and sat in a pool of creamy coconut milk, and accented with a smooth ball of coconut pineapple gelato. Remarkably refreshing and not overly sweet. Next came the rose petal litchee ice cream, which was rolled so it looked like a closed rose bud. Â Beautiful attention to detail that did not fail to be noticed. Â The first thing I tasted was a hint of rose, which melted away leaving only a ghost of the flowery essence in it's wake, then the prevailing taste of litchee. Â A smaller ball of raspberry granita with chunks of litchee complemented the ice cream, adding a more familiar dimension to the exotic teaser. The crowning delight: Hot Valrhona Chocolate SoufflÃ©, Vermont Maple Ice Cream, Vanilla Ice Cream and Chocolate Sorbet This has to be one of my favorite souffles. Â It was hot, rich gooey on the inside like a flourless chocolate cake, but remarkably light as well given the airy texture of the souffle. Â The ice creams were also stellar. Â The maple ice cream had a nice grainy sugary texture with hints of caramel and coffee, the rich dark chocolate sorbet studded with small chunks of brownie, and the comforting familiar vanilla. With the check came a tray of miniature desserts: pineapple cake, passion fruit gelle, sesame sandwich with caramel, almond chocolate cake, tuille cookie, green macaron, cognac truffle. The cognac truffle, passion fruit gelle and sesame cookie were my favorites! As I was leaving the establishment, tastebuds wowed and devastated, they sent me home with a loaf of lemon cake from their bakery next door. What most stunned me was their attention to every detail in the courses. Â Each element was carefully spiced to amplify the natural taste and coax it to it's culinary peak. Will I come again? Â Yes. Â It will be a place I will go to every time I am in NY.",1
4814,490,4,2/25/2009,"I went there on last Friday...it was awesome, if you have not been there recently refresh your memory by experiencing what is arguably the best lunch deal in the city today. I had absolutely no criticism of any dish I devoured. What I ordered was not only perfectly executed and promptly served the restaurant also showered me with free extra courses and sides to my delight.",1
4815,490,4,2/23/2009,"I came here for a special birthday party. We had the party in the room downstairs. Started out with hor d'oeuvres, which were really delicious. I don't know if they if offer it on the regular menu but it was REALLY tasty. I had the phyllo crusted shrimp as an appetizer, the rack of lamb entree, coconut soup to cleanse the palette, and some plum dessert with lavender ice cream and mango sorbet. The appetizer was really good (the scallop was the best) and the rack of lamb was tender and perfectly seasoned, not to mention the potato puree was REALLY good. The coconut I was not so impressed and the dessert was good but not anything to die for. The other chocolate dessert looked extremely rich and most people didn't finish it. This was my first experience with NY fine dining, and I would say it was pretty good. Also it didn't hurt that everything was paid for. Bouley gives ladies a lemon pound cake thing when they leave. Unfortunately, it was really dry and probably leftovers from the bakery. Will probably throw it out. The lunch tasting is probably your best bet. The decor was really nice. It's got a cozy but elegant, romantic French feel to it. Would be a good place to take a date.",1
4816,490,4,2/11/2009,"The last time i visited this place was probably a year ago. I can't remember how the food tasted like but I remembered it was not too bad, but the desserts were heavenly. On top of what we'd ordered (6 desserts for 6 of us ladies), we were given another 2 comps. we all almost died of sugar and happiness and they were just so good. However, I'm giving a 4 star for the average food and rude manager.",1
4817,490,5,2/6/2009,"The best meal I've ever had. The service was great, and the tasting menu exceptional. If you are into fine dining, this is the ultimate. I ordered the 100 dollar tasting, which was more than plenty of food.",1
4818,490,5,1/27/2009,"This is Bouley 3.0. Â I missed the first version of David Bouley's downtown flagship, which closed shortly before I settled in the city. Â  I dined many times behind the arched windows of its successor, which is now to become Bouley Bakery again. Â Bouley (I know, it's complicated) has shuffled west and taken up residence on a dark corner of Duane and Hudson, just across from the same chef's Secession (formerly Danube). The menu has received some close attention. Â My enthusiasm for the old Bouley had been tempered over the years by the extreme familiarity of an almost unchanging menu. Â I felt there were only so many times one could face the famous ""Return from Chiang Mai"" appetizer, the line-caught Â Chatham cod, the fluffy white chocolate dessert. Â The new menu is recognizably Bouley, but at least it has some new treats. Notable among the new creations (new to me, anyway), is a porcini flan with Dungeness crab and black truffle dashi. Â It appears on the carte and both tasting menus, and the second time I dined here it appeared as a welcome complimentary dish. Â Served in a little iron pot, the truffle scent is intense when the lid is lifted. Â The crab is generously proportioned, and the chawan mushi (for such is the flan) of Â tasty, eggy delicacy. Â  Bouley (who, I might mention, was cooking dinner each time I visited), has not resisted the great egg trend of 2008. Â He serves a ""farm"" egg, as opposed to a ""factory"" egg, Â with creamy polenta, flecks of Serrano ham, some decent slices of white truffle, artichoke (which I somehow missed) Â and sunchoke, and a garlic-coconut sauce. Â It reads like a novel, but the prime flavors of egg, corn and truffle were true and tasty. Maine lobster is a regular feature on Bouley's menus too, but at least he knows how to cook it. Â There is still too much chewy lobster in this town, but this was exemplary, served with a warm hearts of palm salad and tart persimmon sauce. Â  The chicken breast was Bouley at his most classic. Â  The breast was sliced and interleaved with black truffles - an update on a demi-deuile (half-mourning) presentation which Escoffier would have recognized. Â The breast had been soaked in buttermilk; the sauce was a rich, sticky chicken stock reduction, and a fingerling purÃ©e showed up on its own little saucer. If the chicken was enjoyable, I actually thought the approach to the veal saddle was misconceived. Â I say that with some trepidation, as David Bouley has forgotten more about cooking than I will ever know...but: it had been cooked for a very long time, at too low a temperature for the collagen fully to breakdown. Â With delicate meat came unwelcome globules. Â Maybe I was unlucky. Â The veal sat on a Â parsley root sauce and a subtle almond purÃ©e. The pre-dessert is a rather too large scoop of yoghurt sorbet. Â This is followed by your choice, and quite likely whatever the kitchen thinks you should eat too. Â I was comped, for example, this pineapple carpaccio with lime sorbet and grape halves, alongside a rather elaborate construction based on pink and purple plums which I'd chosen myself. Â And then there are chocolates and petits fours, and of course a big, sharply flavored lemon cake to take home. Â You will leave Bouley stuffed. Although regular Bouley diners will recognize most of the staff and some of the dishes from the West Broadway restaurant, one can only salute the energy (and expenditure) with which the chef has re-launched the venture I suspect is closest to his heart. Â  David Bouley is a driven man, and at his best can still cook like a dream.",1
4819,490,5,1/26/2009,"on top of all the good things said by fellow yelpers, Bouley also offers vegetarian menu, Â ""off the menu"" more exactly - tell the waiter your dietary restrictions (meat, egg, dairy, any allergies etc) and the chef will improvise appetizer and main entree for you. Â Since the chef needs to come up with dishes based on customers' random combination of restrictions, the waiter wouldn't be able to give you a forecast of food you are about to get but we definitely enjoyed our food tonight. one caveat is that I've no idea how much this ""improvised chef's vegetarian tasting menu"" costs - i was being a lady and didn't even move a finger when the bill came...i know i know i'm being a hypocrite for loving my financial independency only when i'm not on a date...i will work on this...",1
4820,490,5,1/25/2009,"Wow, I haven't yelped this yet?! My visit to NY included all cheap and reasonable eats, but I wanted to do something upscale and Bouley's $48 lunch tasting menu fit the bill. This was my first upscale dining experience with a tasting menu, I was a virgin before that. I also came by myself, and although a bit akward for me, totally worth the experience and food. Food roundup (it's been awhile so memory may be a bit fuzzy): Amuse: Chilled shrimp and some type of granita. Really light, great amuse. It was summer so very refreshing as well. Bread: They have a bread cart with all different types of goodies. Fresh baked bread with butter, yumm. I heart crusty bread and it's very crusty here. 2nd course of various seafood w/pesto broth: Separately cooked scallop, shrimp, squid, and crabmeat in one dish. OMG, the scallop was cut like an onion blossom, huge, nicely seared, cooked perfectly and hearty! The shrimp was crusted in spaghetti-like strands of phyllo and crunchy. My favorite savory course! 3rd course of seared fish (halibut or salmon) w/foam: Nice crispy crust on this one and the microgreens on the side was actually seasoned, I know I'm in Michelin territory here (2 stars at the time I dined, I didn't even know). The side of mashed potatoes were super creamy. 4th course of pork with pea risotto: Pork was braised and tore apart like pulled pork with crisp skin on top, yum. There was a coffee flavored foam on the side, and surprisingly accented the pork well. Not my fave, pork seemed a bit dry in some spots. Palate cleanser of mango sorbet and yogurt soup: Nice and light, perfect amount of sweetness. 5th course of chocolate molten cake w/trio of ice creams: Yummy with a melting hot core, but not too sweet. I loved the maple ice cream, really nice. Complimentary dessert of rosewater granita and rasberry sorbet: At this point really stuffed, but couldn't pass this up. Nice and refreshing. Cookies: Little macaroon, sugar crisp, and bite size cake... delish and great later on for a snack. Lowdown: Very happy with Bouley and will always remember it as my first tasting menu. Â Service is proper,they kept correcting my utensil placeage (coming from California, no one cares and a bit more casual if they know you're green). The decor is a bit more matronly, kind of like a high tea atmosphere. Food was exceptional and a pretty good price. I did get charged $4.50 for my iced tea and $4.00 coffee with dessert so you get ripped on non-acoholic drinks. I know they moved recently and hope the food hasn't changed. Â They did lose their 2 star Michelin rating for moving so I guess they must prove themselves once again the the Michelin gods. If you want to try their baked goods, they have a bakery storefront nearby.",1
4821,490,5,1/20/2009,"Stunning interior -- the paintings reminded me of Provence. Even the floor is notable, what with its stone tiles from Versailles. The restroom was velvety red and lush, exactly what I expected. I thought I'd miss the old space on West Broadway, but this one is just as impressive and has much higher ceilings. The porcini flan was beautifully presented and the duck was perfectly cooked. The Pennsylvania chicken is also a winner. Though I love the chocolate souffle, the meringue was a nice contrast. I just would have wanted more of the pistachio that came with it. I wish that the phyllo-crusted shrimp in ocean herbal broth was still part of the tasting menu. And nixing the bread cart is a minor disappointment, but the selection of saffron walnut, pistachio, fig, country, etc. is still exceptional.",1

4823,490,3,1/3/2009,"I've been to Bouley twice, and while I enjoyed both meals, I have to be hard on it given the price. Â It certainly is a creative menu, and most of the food is quite good. Â There are always a few surprises, like a Roquefort cheese ice cream (!!), and some of them work, but some of them don't. Â I give Bouley credit for stretching the possibilities for food combinations, but the lobster and mango appetizer I had was flat and disappointing, and the above-mentioned cheese ice cream was interesting but ultimately didn't work. Finally, my biggest complaint with this place is that they give you too many sweets. Â Before dessert, there is a complementary chef's choice dessert, then you get your main dessert, then they bring chocolates, and invariably they throw something else in like cookies, or an extra dessert (for example if it's someone's birthday). Â By the time you leave you can't walk, and you feel sick from all the excessive sugar. A nice meal, but for the money I think you can get a better experience elsewhere.",1
4824,490,2,12/23/2008,"I'm shocked by how many people have fallen in love with this restaurant. I went for lunch with a friend, on a Monday I believe, and yes, the smell of apples is very inviting. Too bad the interior is stuffy and decorated by everyone's grandma. We were stuffed back into a dark corner (even though there were plenty of other tables), and the wait staff was just a bit awkward overall. No real way to explain it, maybe their timing was just slightly off, or they were too attentive because they had nothing better to do. I don't like feeling like people are watching me while I'm eating, unless it's Milo Ventimiglia. Then I don't mind being watched. My relationship with Bouley started off rocky with some raw tomato amuse-bouche that really shouldn't have cleared the kitchen. Honestly I don't remember much of the rest, but just that with each course I was more and more disappointed. The bread cart was the highlight of the meal, and different than other restaurants, but that's just not enough to save the hot mess that was our lunch. People have compared this to jean-georges, or daniel, and the other top restaurants in the city (which is the reason I chose to make a reservation here). They could not be more wrong. Yes they have a very reasonably priced lunch menu, but don't go in with hopes of grandeur! You're not going to get the quality of the french laundry at wholesale prices. Maybe dinner is a better experience? Hard to know, as I will probably not be returning.",1
4825,490,5,12/17/2008,"Feel like Alice in Wonderland - one minute you're in the present, then after going through the rabbit hole, you're in another. Opening the doors upon Bouley's new Duane street venue, you will find yourself in an entrance hall with 10-ft shelves of fresh apples, their scent just tantalizing you for your upcoming dining experience. The dining space here is an upgrade from the last Bouley venue (not that the previous had any problems, it was fine enough!): a lavender purple theme, with beautiful art-deco furnishings, with stone walls and columns reminiscent of a European romanesque castle/church. True, the attentive waitstaff are a tad snotty: pronounce ""Bouley"" (boo-lay) wrong, and they huff and puff to correct your pronunciation. But who gives a damn, the food is simply marvelous. Â  Â  The charm of the waitstaff is that they are extremely attentive, and yet you don't feel as if you are being watched under surveillance to get you borderline-paranoid. They're very nifty about that. Â  Â I've come here only for the lunch tasting-menu, which is extremely reasonable for the quality and quantity of delicacies brought. After each lunch, I truly wish I had medieval squire boy (to go with the decor) to roll me back to the subway station. Â  Â  I need not say which dishes are recommended, and which are not. They are all of perfect portions, taste and presentation. No wonder they don't have salt and pepper shakers at the table! I've never had a dodgy dining experience here. Â  Â  Â Word of advice: the bread they serve is magnificent - go for the pistachio bread with their fine butter, and also the soft and moist garlic bread if you appreciate garlic. Â  Â  Â When you're stuffed to the limit, they bring you complimentary chocolates, sugared jellos and more along with your tea/coffee. By that time, you know your stomach is at the brink of bursting, and yet you have the quest to try them. By all means - do it. Human stomachs are surprisingly expandable, I have found.",1
4826,490,5,11/30/2008,"Simply FABULOUS. My review is of Bouley when it used to be on W Broadway. The smell of apples surely hits you when you walk through the entrace to the restaurant. I enjoyed every dish of the tasting menu we got. The organic farm egg steamed with black truffle as well as the farm raised baby pig were truly outstanding. In addition, I also enjoyed the phyllo crusted florida shrimp. Only gripe (small one) being that we were given multiple servings of sorbet (to cleanse our paletes throughout the meal), so I was probably looking forward to having a dessert of a different sort. However, since we were here for the lunch tasting, I totally didn't expect to be given a patisserie pound cake to be taken home (as would be the case for a dinner tasting). Pleasantly surprised. Looking forward to trying the new menu at the new place down the road. Bummer that they were not included in the this year's Michelin listing because of the move.",1
4827,490,5,11/29/2008,"Another milestone, another NYC restaurant. The Â funny thing is, the last three milestones were all places I went to in a week (I splurged big time) yet, I waited hundreds of reviews apart to write about them. Actually work keeps getting in the way (dammit!) and the backlog is getting so large that places are closing left and right, before i get to review them. In fact I understand that Bouley's Danube has gone away and I've never got to try it! I also understand that since I've been here, Bouley has moved to a new locale. Better that than closing! For my last meal in NYC I had decided to come here for the fact that it was; within walking distance of where I was staying, Jean Georges had a killer deal but was too far for the time I had left, and of course the raves I'd read from my research. Walking down the street Bouley stood out with it's large wooden door and reddish facade. As you enter, the smell of apples surrounds you, and you realize that there are shelves upon shelves of them. Passing through the corridor you are greeted Â by a very polished man with a very distinct French accent. I think since they've moved, the dress code has been bumped up to jacket required but even before that change, we were well under dressed compared to the business power lunchers and special occasion celebraters around us. Would this affect how we were treated? Did we look like the dreaded tourists? I was a bit nervous at first but there were a few disparate examples of casual throughout. As we perused the menu it struck me that there was a tasting menu for lunch. Argh, only and hour and fifteen to spare. Could we do it? Our server said that she could get it done but advised that it wouldn't be the experience that we were meant to have because it would be rushed. Good advice I say. So we went with the a la carte approach. After perusing the menu, we ended up with: Amuse Bouche -Apple-Mint Sparking Soda Entrees -Maine Day Boat Lobster with fresh porcini mushrooms, black trumpet mushrooms, pencil asparagus, parsley root purÃ©e and burgundy wine sauce -Wild King Salmon with morels, crosnes, morel purÃ©e, fava beans grilled a la plancha, naval orange powder, and clementine glaze Cheese Course - Small taste of Roquefort BrÃ»lÃ©e with bartlett pears and burnt black mission fig jam Pre Dessert -Texas Pink Grapefruit Soup infused with green cardomon, star anise, and tahitian vanilla with campari sugar and fromage blanc sorbet (pre dessert) Dessert -Organic Passionfruit And Blueberry Meringue with passionfruit-caramel sauce, huckleberry coulis and provence lavender ice cream -Truffles, gelatins, maccaroons, caramels, and a few other small sweets. Wow. Let's get something straight here. We ordered the two entrees and the one dessert. Everything else was complimentary. Man do they aim to please. I thought we were getting the express lunch and it still turned out to be this amazing tremendous meal with every single item being fantastic. Remember the questions I asked earlier? Well the answers were resoundingly no. I've been known from time to time, to push the limit of ""business/casual/elegant"" based on my mood, but we were treated as well here as I've been treated anywhere, despite our comparably casual attire. The service was elegant, affable, and perfectly timed from start to finish. Whoever said the French were snooty never dined here. To top it off, the Maitre D' gave us a parting gift as we said our goodbyes. They've certainly shown what pampering a food lover it like and I shall return in anticipation of seeing the new locale. Michelin, give Bouley another star already!",1

Yesterday marked my first anniversary with my girlfriend and I celebrated it by both asking her to marry me (she said yes, 'natch) and by taking us to a fancypants restaurant. Bouley wasn't my first choice, but after doing some research prior to yesterday, it seemed like a good choice. Oh how right I was. The food was phenomenal, the wine selection was great, the wait staff was AMAZING, the atmosphere was perfect (we heard a quiet, wonderful cover of a Smiths song while at dinner which made us giggle happily) and it really was a perfect ending to a perfect day. We both had the four-course tasting menu and it knocked our collective socks off. The chef, upon hearing that we'd just gotten engaged from the waiter, brought us a complimentary--and delicious--creme brulee with ""Congragulations"" written on the plate. We were never wanting for anything, be it food, water or privacy. Was it expensive? Sure. Was it worth it? You betcha.",1
4829,490,5,11/17/2008,"Amazing tasting menu that never ended. Fabulous ambiance, and not too loud (unlike most New York restaurants). Wish I could afford this more often!",1
4830,490,4,11/15/2008,"Well, apparently I came here on the third day of it's reopening, which accounts for the slightly disjointed service and not being able to locate it right away. Or maybe my brother just got turned around, who knows. However, I have to say that I still had an enjoyable time. The occasion was my mother's birthday and we ordered the tasting menu (lunch). There was melt-in-your-mouth tuna, rare and succulent duck breast, a brightly-flavored skate dish (my favorite), coconut soup and I chose the chocolate souffle (gorgeous) over the flan. The food was amazingly good; perfect lunch - not filling but still very satisfying. The service, as I said, was disjointed, but still attentive and welcoming. As with all of Bouley's establishments, I love that they give their parting guests the wonderful lemon cake that the bakery around the corner provides. I want to come back for another occasion, and maybe for dinner. Although lunch was just fine. Yay! I'm a fan!",1
4831,490,2,11/12/2008,"what a disappointment. Â my husband and i purposefully picked this restaurant for our wedding anniversary / his birthday. Â we mistakenly thought this was the newer bouley that was reinventing the old bouley from the '90's that had been one of our all time favorites back in the day.... that said, we arrived for our 9:45 reservation and were told (even though we were already 5 minutes behind) that they were running 20 minutes late. Â honestly, the table should have been waiting for the kind of prices and pretentions they have. Â it was disconcerting to see 3 other couples waiting in their ""bar"" area (there's no real bar) for their tables. Â a group came in behind us and were immediately seated. Â i'm assuming they were friends with someone who works there. Â  that said, my husband and i looked at each other and were about to pull the rip cord. Â we started heading towards the door and the hostess said, ""oh, you must be soand so. Â your table is waiting"". Â the guy who seated us snickered and said, ""i bet you thought this was going to be worse."" Â unbelievable. we were seated right by the entrance to the bathrooms. Â very romantic. Â  anyway, they had already run out of their better breads - i was lucky enough to get the end of the pepper bread but when i asked for a second piece they told me i could only get the baguette. Â for a place that has it's own bakery that's kind of pathetic. Â especially if you've been made to wait to eat. the food was really good but very rich. Â suffice it to say that it hit my stomach like a mack truck. Â  my husband and i play a game about our top ten restaurants that we've ever eaten. Â this obviously is not even on the alternate list. Â would not go back.",1
4832,490,3,11/10/2008,"I agree with some of the negative reviews. Bouley has a stellar reputation. Many of the best chefs in NYC came through this ktichen. But I fear that those glory days are long gone. The food here was disappointingly average and unoriginal for this class of dining. I sampled the tasting menu for free with a pharm rep. Â I would have been really pissed to pay for the meal otherwise, it was incredibly expensive for what you got. The ""sashima quality tuna"" appetizer started the meal on a mediocre foot. I've eaten alot of good maguro. I could instantly recognize that this tuna was of average quality, it had the bland, freezer burn taste that you would get at Go Sushi. . The main entre was beef utilizing a marbled cut of beef from italy, intended to be Kobe-like. Â However it was far from it. The dessert and bread however were excellent. I guess I would come back to the bakery. So all in all, disappointing given this restaurant 's reputation and history. Would not come back if I had to pay for it.",1
4833,490,2,11/10/2008,"I know I may get boo-ed for this review, but in my humble opinion, Bouley is expensive and overrated. Â Where can you pay $160 for wine pairings with your dinner that would have cost $150 if you bought the whole bottles at a liquor store? Â Why, at Bouley, of course! Â  The morning after, I googled the wines we were served out of innocent curiosity, and every single one of them turned out to cost less than 30 bucks a bottle. Â Bewildered, I did the math: my husband and I paid $80 each to add wine pairings to our five course tasting = $160. Â At the liquor store: $30 x 5 bottles = $150. Â I must also point out that we were served one GLASS with each course, not a whole bottle, obviously. Â So that irks me even further. Â 160 bucks for 10 glasses of wine?? Â When we could have paid less than $150 for whole bottles of the stuff? Â Not to mention my $16 martini before dinner. Â Grrr. Â So I'm sore about that. Â Minus one star! The food ranged from eh to good. Â I've had better steak tartar in my life. Â The rack of lamb was pretty tasty, as was this lobster cake thing. Â  There were a couple of filler courses, like the ""chef's canape"" and a weird soupy grapefruit thing in a shot glass. Â As far as tastings go, the portions were on the small size. Â And, the nebraskan beef entree, which was the size of deck of cards, cost an additional $45. Â Minus one star! The servers were pleasant, attentive, and at our table way too much. Â Our silverware was replaced at least twice, and one of those times Â we hadn't used them yet. Â We found it difficult to have a conversation without someone interrupting to ask if everything was going ok. Â Minus a half star! The bathrooms were ANCIENT. Â I half expected a pull chain toilet after walking in and seeing the sinks. Â Minus a half star! Maybe I am too cheap and low-brow to appreciate Bouley. Â Believe me, I really wanted to like this place. Â I know I am being crabby because it is so expensive. Â But shouldn't you expect MORE from an expensive place, not less?",1
4834,490,5,10/26/2008,"Fantastic!!! I had the great pleasure of dining here last weekend with a near and dear friend (who happens to be a Yelper too), and it was a very special meal. I think Megan C said it best when she said 'Be prepared for an enchanting evening.' The wine (was a red from Languedoc) was supremely good. The service was great - they even accommodated my request to order a dish from the Prix Fixe menu as an a la carte dish - the Rouget with Iranian Saffron Risotto. Then came the Halibut which was almost overwhelming rich, but oh-so tender and perfectly cooked. My Famous Foodie Friend (you astute Yelpers will be able to guess who) had the Eggplant Terrine (I'm definitely getting this if I ever go back) and a chef's specialty vegetarian entree (not as impressive). Their famous breads were also good - they have more than a handful of choices, so you can keep going back for more! The saffron-walnut bread was particularly delicious, as others have noted. Deserts were chocolate-y and delicious. A chocolate soaked brioche for me (see pictures) and chocolate souffle for the FFF. An interesting combination as they were similar in appearance but subtly different in texture and flavor. Oh and the restaurant itself is beautiful - the red room casts a beautiful dim light over everything - it's the perfect backdrop to an excellent meal. The apples and the lemon saffron loaf on the way out were just the icing on the beautiful Bouley cake. I saw couples young and old, friends, and families all sharing the delicious food here and enjoying themselves tremendously. I had been wanting to eat here for over a year, and I was finally able to do so, with FFF by my side (and across the table)! =D 5 stars, for the food, service, setting, and of course the company!",1
4835,490,2,10/13/2008,"Overhyped. Overrated. Overblown. For all the buzz, we had a truly average experience. The retro 80s ambiance, dull crowd, horrid toilets, unpolished waiters and an unimaginative menu prompted me to open an account and save you the gastro-financial pain. The lack of music leads one to be 'at the mercy' of ones neighbors. In our case, we were trapped next to four polyester tourists from the Midwest, whose loud, droll conversation about their dog, Juno, and Bush's tax breaks was enough. However, looking around, we realized we had it made compared to the bored senseless, 12 year old ""only child"" there forced to be celebrating his birthday with his wine-quaffing parents?! Â  The flowers, vases, pictures and table lamps looked tired/crooked, rather than fresh and old-world classy, as one would expect. The worst, however, was the 'bathroom'! A fresh and full unflushed toilet bowl welcomed me to an eyeful of poo and a used tampon. Yuck! Was this Shea Stadium? Service was pretty good. Although I have to admit I could not believe how the water boy poured his pitcher of tap water! He literally let it overflow onto the floor and then put it down on the table dripping wet. Or the fact that the bread guy did not change our bread plate and simply plopped added bread on top of half-eaten pieces. Is this Five Stars? The sashimi and cod were very good, but as noted in other reviews of Bouley, not exceptional, as one would expect. Also, the dessert makes up +40% of the meal. While the chocolate souffle is outstanding, it is a bit overkill to have it served with sorbet, another palate cleanser and a plate of petit fours.",1

4837,490,5,10/11/2008,"Truly truly exceptional. Â We came here for my fiancee's birthday and were treated to perhaps the best service I've ever experienced. Â At all times I felt like we had two servers attending to us (a party of two) and they were impeccable. The food was excellent as well...with several 'compliments of the chef' in addition to the fine cuisine we ordered. Â Given the birthday nature, they ended up giving us 5 different desserts and a small lemon herb poundcake to go! Â Also very impressive: Â the bread sommelier. Â Seriously.

The food is great though, but you will never get full here unless you have a hefty budget to spend. The great thing about this place is that the chef cooks right in front of you and makes great conversation. Other than that, the space is a bit small, but cozy. I probably won't go back here, but it's nice to say that I've been here. The lobster is great!",1
4840,490,5,9/12/2008,I have been here with my wife several times and we have yet to be disappointed. On our last visit every course was phenomenal. There was a slight delay in one plate and before I could even think about asking the waiter where our next course was an additional small plate of seafood in light oil and another bottle of wine were at the table. This is the kind of fantastic service I don't get enough of. I felt like a Roman indulging on like 5 desserts. I just couldn't help myself.,1

4842,490,3,8/15/2008,"High Expectations for Perfection -- Life is unfair, and perhaps so is this rating for Bouley. Â But three stars means ""A-OK"" and, given my expectations surrounding a world-class flagship establishment like Bouley (and the accompanying sticker shock), something inside me makes me hesitate to label my experience there as anything more than A-OK. Â This much is undeniable: everything at Bouley was perfectly executed (hell, even damn good) and certainly nothing was worthy of complaint (perhaps except for the unavoidable stuffiness of dining at an A-list French restaurant). Â But what was missing was that ""something else"" -- like the jaw-dropping theatre of a place like Daniel, or the joy of eating super-rare fishes from the Pacific at a place like Le Bernardin. The dining room is serene but not breathtaking, and the food delicious but not mind-blowingly creative. Â So by all means, go and enjoy (which you surely will) but try to leave the high expectations at home.",1
4843,490,5,8/9/2008,Bouley took my breath away from the moment I stepped through the large wooden door...from the entry way lined with fresh granny green apples to the kindness of the hostess to the attentive sommelier who patiently walked us through the pinot noir wines. Â I can't imagine a more pampered dining experience...even in Manhattan.,1
4844,490,3,7/28/2008,"I was quite underwhelmed for this meal. For every dish I had, I can name something similar that was made better eaten recently. Â But trying to remember the dishes I had just after eating there a week ago is incredibly hard... which I guess says something but nevertheless I will try. The amuse was a gazpacho with I believe shrimp and some kind of sorbet. I understand the amuse is suppose to tickle your mouth and wake it up and the best way to do that is by using citrus. But this gazpacho was a bit too tart, compared to a similar amuse a l'atelier which was in my opinion more refined. My app was the steamed egg. It was probably the best dish of the night so no complaints there. My main was the baby pig and compared that to the suckling pig I had a the modern the week before, it paled in comparison. First the skin was not as crispy as I would have liked, thus making the cutting of it, with a rather dull knife, a much harder task than it should have been. The plating was also rather dull. The dessert, brioche, was way too sweet. It actually reminded me of the dessert truck's bread pudding which was more refined Also, the petite fours offered only had one piece each for a table of four. This meant that not everyone at our table can try everything. I didn't quite understand the point of that. Oh, and the decor seemed really out dated with the red, arching ceilings. I didn't feel comfortable... almost a little claustrophobic. I guess I tend to lean toward contemporary settings. Ok, as to not make this restaurant sound like a complete failure, keep in mind, these are all opinions. I also had HUGE expectations considering this is a 2 star Michelin restaurant. So to end on a positive note, the fig bread was also awesome. Definitely get that.",1
4845,490,5,7/27/2008,"Ethereal. The moment you walk in, you feel like you have just left Manhattan and walked into a French dream - an apple-scented cottage with tuxedo-ed waiters lined up - haha!! The food is superb, but even more notable is the exceptional service. The waiters are very French, but are very nice and have a terrific sense of humor. Had the longer tasting menu for lunch, it was delicious all around. Save room for dessert!",1
4846,490,5,7/21/2008,"The best dinner I have ever had...as people have said before it is VERY romantic.

Â we both got the tasting menu and ordered different things so we could try a little bit of everything and i highly recommend it!!!! Â from the scallops that melted in my mouth to the perfectly cooked lamb to the chocolate souffle and 2 other desserts that appeared...all delicious when you leave they give you a small loaf of lemon bread that is so great that i just ate half of it...SO WONDERFUL",1
4847,490,5,7/19/2008,"Exceeded our expectations in every way. Worth every penny. A truly remarkable experience. Makes me want to come again and again, if only to use their restroom. Insert your own boring platitude here ___________. For the past week, wifey and I have been plowing through more NY eats on our never-ending list of places to go. Â In the good ol' days, we used to be able to hit 2 or 3 places a day and not even break a sweat. Â Nowadays, our metabolisms have hit a wall and we're startin' to feel our age... it sucks to get old. Bouley has always been near the top of our places to try but we just haven't found the time... until now. It's an elegant building located in TriBeCa. Â I didn't know what to say when I walked in because the dining room seriously reminded me of a Hobbit home from Lord of the Rings. Â It wasn't bad in any way, just... unusual. Â Deep reds with black accents seemed to be the dominant decor theme. Service from the moment you step in is impeccable. Â The maitre d' and servers swarm all over you, Â but it's not as creepy as it sounds. The breadcart is terrific, it comes around from time to time and they slice heavenly hunks of breads from several choices of freshly baked loaves. Â The roasted garlic loaf is absolutely killer. Food is tremendous. From amuse bouche to the multi-pronged dessert attack, Bouley does it right. Â Even the palette cleansers were memorable. Wifey and I have been very Â fortunate to be able to eat at some pretty kick-ass places in our lives. Â We count our experience at Bouley to be one of them.",1
4848,490,5,7/3/2008,I don't remember exactly what I ate because it was a year ago but I remember the distinct smell of apples when you walk into the restaurant. The walls are literally stocked with fresh green apples and it was very taunting since I'm allergic to fresh apples. But I had dinner here with my family and we sat in the Red Room and yes... its red. I hope you go with your significant other to Bouley one day because it is so romantic inside. Â  Â The chef gave us some complimentary desserts and when we were leaving the hostess gave each person a Bouley lemon cake to enjoy at home.,1

Â The wine recommendations were in line and they didn't try to push the priciest bottle on you. Â Food is spectacular. Â I forget what I had (knew I should have written this review sooner) but, all of it was good and up to par with my expectations.

The hubby and I decided upon the chef's tasting menu. We were initially served a very refreshing palette cleanser that consisted of passion fruit sorbet. Oh My God, it was heaven especially since I was a bit nauseated from the cab drive to the restaurant. Our entree's came out within a timely manner and were spaced out evenly. Minus one star for making us feel rushed towards the end. You could tell that they need to seat people and were getting antsy from the patrons because the waiters started to increase their walking pace and we were given our final palette cleanser as were still eating our dessert.

I think the highest count I've gotten is 12. I always feel full, happy, and satisfied after a meal here. And the good thing is, it won't empty your wallet. The big lunch tasting menu is only about $50. This is CHEAP for a Michelin 2-star. The bread is also very delicious. I can't help but constantly ask for more (especially the pepper bread and the garlic bread). And of course, the coolest part, walking in and out of the place.

Â all were excellent and from the fellow guests they too enjoyed the other options. Â they even had no problem with my one veggie guest. Â she had the egg without ham, a onion tartlette with various veggies and the creme brulee. there indeed is a bread service and boy do they love to push these carbs. Â don't forget ladies, to grab your lemony poundcake on your way out.",1
4859,490,5,4/29/2008,"AMAZING!!! This is for sure a special occasion restaurant. I have had some amazing meals in my days but this could very well be the best meal I have ever had. The favors were perfect, the service was spot on. The whole experience was perfect.",1
4860,490,5,4/15/2008,"Wonderful meal. Â Not the best I've had, but still worthy of all its accolades. Â Also, the lunch deal is a steal. What I have to mention though, is that this place has AMAZING bread service.",1
4861,490,5,4/8/2008,"One of the most spectacular dining experiences I've ever had. Â No contest. From beginning to end, I was amazed. Â Everything from the tasting menu (a bargain at $95) was delicious - I had the best lobster I've ever tasted - and our waiter constantly brought us little plates of appetizers and sides, ""compliments of the chef"". Â Before dessert, we were served a ""Pink Grapefruit Soup"" to clear our palates...even this icy, refreshing ""soup"" was bursting with flavor. Â  On our way out the door, we were handed little gift boxes that contained individual portions of lemon cake. Â As if I wasn't in love with Bouley already! Â If I could give out six stars on this thing, that last little gesture would've definitely earned a star of its own.",1
4862,490,5,4/8/2008,"This is a lovely restaurant. Â The dcor is lovely with very comfortable dining rooms. Â Service was impeccable. Â All of our courses were delivered with precision so that each plate was placed in front of its diner at precisely the same moment. Â The food was amazing. Â I was there for dinner on a recent Sunday night. Â We were treated to several courses of chef's compliments, and they were all outstanding - some of the best taste sensations that I've ever had. Â They were all so innovative and intricate, I don't even remember what they were exactly to describe them, except to say they were phenomenal. Â I started with an appetizer called Return From Chiang Mai, made with chilled Maine lobster, mango, artichoke, and Serrano ham with a tropic dressing. Â I know it sounds weird, but it was one of the best things I've ever eaten. Â I had a rack of lamb with ricotta gnocchi for my entre, and it was flavorful and quite good, but I thought the lamb could have used more seasoning. Â They served a fingerling potato puree that knocked my socks off. Â For dessert, I had something they called the Chocolate Frivolous, consisting of toasted hazelnut dacquiose, chocolate brulee, chocolate souffl, chocolate parfait rolled in soybean powder, and pine nut ice cream. Â As you can imagine, it was over the top. Â It was so rich, I couldn't finish it. Â I think that may have been the first dessert that I've not been able to finish. Â We washed everything down with a fantastic bottle of Stag's Leap cabernet. Â Over all, it was fantastic. Â When we left ,the ladies were even given goody bags containing tea cakes from their bakery for breakfast the next day. Â Highly recommended for a romantic dinner.",1
4863,490,1,4/7/2008,"Cockroach on my table. Yes, you read correctly. Cockroach! Hopefully that's enough for most of you to avoid dining here but I'll give you the full review anyway since it was equally horrendous. Upon arrival, the hostess takes my coat and escorts me through the dining room where all the waiters are tall attractive men. So far very good. Unfortunately, we somehow get a french waiter, possibly the manager? So rude. I came to dine with a friend I haven't seen in awhile so we were chattering away once we were seated. The waiter comes by after about 5 minutes to ask what we'd like to drink. This was a few days after Christmas and after all the holiday wine, I felt very much in need of a cocktail so I asked what his selections of vodka were. The waiter in a confused but haughty tone replies ""vodka?"". Yes vodka, bitch. I need a drink. Don't scoff at my selection. I'm the paying customer! Â Anyway, I order it and they were slow to bring out the drinks but they were very impatient trying to take our food order. I'm trying to talk to my friend and the waiter literally keeps coming back every 5 minutes to take our food order even though we keep telling him we need more time to look over the menu. And it's not even so much that he keeps coming back, it's the attitude he gives us when we say we're not ready yet. So far this is a pretty terrible fine dining experience, wouldn't you say so? I think he got frustrated with us because he assigned us a different waiter. Lame. I wished I wrote this review sooner because I could have described each of my dishes and explained my feelings about each one and why I disliked them but alas, it's been 4 months. What I can remember is my impression of the menu. Most dishes had quirky ingredient combinations and I had a hard time trying to decide on a dish that sounded tasty. My worries were confirmed when our food came out b/c the entrees tasted equally awkward and unbalanced. I would chalk it up to a poor entree selection if all the food that night didnt have the same theme about them. Everything from the bread to the amuse bouche to the appetizers and sides and desserts were awkwardly balanced. I can't believe this place got 2 Michelin stars. To top it off, we were not comped in any way for the horrible cockroach experience. Did I mention they took a lengthy 5-10 mins to change out our silverware after clearing off the bug? Bouley is absolutely horrible.",1
4864,490,5,4/6/2008,"Bouley was probably one of my top 5 best meals of all time. Â My wife and I each had the $95 tasting menu. Â The food was excellent, although as someone else pointed out, the portions are on the small side. Â The service was also incredible and the decor beautiful. Â Certainly a leisurely dinner, but that's to be expected.",1
1992,490,5,3/26/2008,"Thank you Susy and Terri for treating me to this scrumdillyumcious meal! We came in to this 5 star establishment with jeans and sweatshirts on for brunch. Looking around the restaurant we notice that we are very very under dressed. Bashfully i ask the maitre d if there was a dress code requirement and he politely tells me ""yes."" Mortified I put my head down in shame as the maitre d asks me if i am wearing shoes? i reply ""yes"". Him: are you wearing a shirt? Me: Yes Him: Lastly, are you wearing pants? Me: YES! (smiling as i finally figured out where he is going with this) Him: then you meet our requirements! i love that there was no pretentious attitude at this fine establishment. We came in and all had the $45 brunch tasting menu. What a steal for the quality of food. What exactly does $45 dollars get you? Multiple courses of yummyness! Please refer below to Susy H's review for our whole meal description. Â  Oh and as you walk out, they gave us a small parting gift. it was a small loaf cake! Great friends, great service, great food... what more could a girl ask for?",1
4865,490,5,3/25/2008,"So Ter (an aspiring vegetarian) and I decide that we are going to go visit Esther in NY. (Hi Terri H.!, Hi Esther K.!). So I pop on yelp to find a good restaurant in the NYC area. A restaurant so expensive that after our meal we would have a whole lot of dish washing to do. Ne hooz, we each had the 5 course, 48 dollar tasting menu. And we all thought it was a good steal, considering the quality and taste of the food. Our first course was the phyllo crusted shrimp with an assortment of seafood and the sashimi. The sashimi was hands down my fav. (But a valuable lesson I learned in NY is, if you have a hangover, sushi is not a brilliant idea). So once again, if you are hungover the day you go to Bouley, I suggest you stay away from the sashimi. For the second course, my posse and I decide on the farm egg steamed with truffle oil, ham and 25 yr old balsamic vinegar. However, the truffle oil and vinegar mixture looked an awful like a foam party I attended in college with... You guessed it with Ter and Esther. ME: Hey guys doesn't this look like that foam party we went to in college. ESTHER: OMG. Hahaha. ME: You know I was dry for 2 weeks. TER: (inspects plate) Oh. It really does look like a foam party on a plate. Ter picks up piece and puts in her mouth.. TER: Oh party in my mouth... Next thing you know we decide that we were idiots in college for going to a foam party in... winter. And how the truffle oil foam truly, really, indeed looked like a foam party on a plate. After the party we literally white and flakey, like the parmesan in our dish. HAHA. We decided the dish was perfect until mention of the notorious foam party. Ok, back to 2008, Esther and I had the farm raised baby pig. Babe has never tasted so good. The meat was fresh and juicy. Ter opted for the duck, an unfortunate aftermath from watching too many PETA specials. Did you know you can order you duck rare? I always thought you had to cook your poultry all the way through. *shrug* Â (anyone please advise). After our main course we finished with what felt like 6 desserts. Ter was in heaven, which is a good thing because as I was ordering, I stuck my finger between my nostrils and said oink to the waiter. Bet you the people at Bouley were like, ""Who let these idiots in?"". Esther and I thought it was funny. But after that Miss Piggy impression Terri wanted to sock me. She said I looked like a pig on a PETA special and she loves animals so much she can't eat them. Thanks for not wanting to eat me, Ter! Foam on Bouley, foam on!",1
4866,490,5,3/23/2008,"One of my favorite restaurants ever. Â From the moment you step through the heavy wooden doors, Bouley delights your senses. Â You enter a sort of antechamber with apples lined along the walls, and your nose fills with their deliciously sweet scent. Â Service is impeccable and the food almost flawless. Â One night, service was a little slow and it took a long time for our main courses to come out because of a problem in the kitchen. Â They sent out an additional small course to tide us over while we waited. Â And because it was getting late, we decided not to order dessert that night but while we were waiting for the check, they sent out THREE free desserts for us. Â  Bouley never ceases to impress me with their inventive, flavorful dishes. Â Highly recommended for anyone who loves food. Â  P.S. Â Ladies, they also give you a lemon tea cake for breakfast the next day on your way out of the restaurant",1
4867,490,5,3/19/2008,"You walk through the arched doorway of the light red, French country-styled building and you're transported from a bustling Tribeca street down a hall lined with shiny, aromatic apples into a cozy, cavernous, lightly lit entry way. At the end of the hall, you're greeted by two hostesses who graciously welcome you to Bouley, and after coats are checked, you're swiftly whisked to your seat by the maitre'd. It's incredible. There's no wait. No crowd to fight through. No suggestion to have a drink at the bar while you wait for your table. Just you and your guest escorted to a charming table for two, and once settled, presented with menus and the wine list. So far, elegance is the name of this game. The menu is incredible. The tasting menu, unbelievable! Five courses... and if you're inclined, 5-courses paired with the perfect wine. But O, what to do? Should we go for the tasting menu or a la carte? After much deliberation, we opted for a la carte. The meal then starts with a canape from the chef -- roquefort sorbet with a green apple jelly... and it's from this point the meal begins to unfold. On my side of the table, we had the panach of three ""salads"" comprised of a creamy & sweet foie gras napoleon with pruneaux d'agen, croquant brle of butternut squash, and warm parmesan Cape Cod sea scallops and Florida shrimp with a fresh bay leaf sauce. The perfect combination of sweet, savory, creamy, crunchy, surf and turf. I loved everything on my plate, and had the meal ended there, I would have walked away happy. Paired with a crisp Alsatian Pinot Gris, this was the perfect start. On the other side of the table were chilled Long Island Blue Point and West Coast Kumamoto Oysters on the half shell with a wine and shallot dressing, followed by seared New York State foie gras with pruneaux d'agen and apple-rosemary pure. Â The oysters, really nice, but the sort of thing we can get at home. The foie gras? Seared to perfection... and a very generous portion that had us practically sopping up every last bit with the bread. The bread. As a rule I do my best to not fill up on the bread. But this bread? Man alive! It's wonderful... fresh and chewy and crunchy! And since you need to either request a little more or wait for the bread cart to come by, I didn't get too carried away. Honestly, Bouley's bread is worthy of it's own review...but that's for another time. After a little rest, we have the next course: The Main Event. Me: Organic Connecticut Farm-Raised Baby Pig with a gallete of crisp homemade fettuccine, shitake mushrooms, scallion chiffonade and onion ginger soubise (paired with a lovely Cote du Rhone). The menu mentions that this little piggy was organic milk-fed with a diet of organic apples and clean grass only. What this meant to me was that the crispy, thin-skinned pork was tender and delicate and clean on the palette. This combined with the crispy gallete, earthy shitake's, and slightly sweet soubise made for a delightful combination of flavors and textures. Then I tasted what was goin' on across the table. The rack of lamb. Organic Colorado rack of lamb with homemade sheep's milk ricotta gnocchi, a rocket (a.k.a. arugula) salad, fava beans, fresh sage, and zucchini-mint pure, a delightful take on the classic mint jelly (that I happen to NOT like). Â The zucchini-mint puree on the other hand, fantastic! Perfectly medium rare, the rack on my BF's plate made my mouth water and my teeth tingle. And this was before I tasted it. Fortunately, mid meal the plates were swapped and any food envy I was harboring was laid to rest. We both agreed that while the pig was great, the rack of lamb was amazing. By the end of the main course, we were stuffed. But what about the chocolate souffle?! The chocolate brioche?? As we stuffed the last bites of beast into our mouths, any hopes we had for dessert were wiped away. Or so we thought. As we waited for our bill to be prepared, we were presented with petits fours... the perfect sweetness to close the meal. Delicate little bites of pastry and sugar and cream, almost making me wish I'd ordered the chocolate brioche... Almost. (can you say ""Food Coma""?) With regard to the overall experience, impeccable service combined with a beautiful, cavernous dining room, and an incredible wine list, Bouley is the creme-de-la-creme of dining. Bouley. Boo-lay. When I close my eyes, I recall warmly lit arched ceilings, soft murmurings of conversations over candle light, and sumptuously plated food served with care and elegance. ((sigh)) Now I think I'll go and cry myself to sleep over the fact that my new favorite restaurant is 2,500 miles away.",1
4868,490,5,3/17/2008,"UPDATE (6/5/08): Below is my original review of Bouley, which I wrote a while back after going there for lunch. I was a little underwhelmed at the time, and only gave it 4 stars. I went again for dinner recently, and had an amazing time. I spent much more than I could afford (way way way much more... ouch), but it was all really worth it. The service was excellent, the food stellar, and they kept bringing us complimentary stuff... Now I realize this is really an outstanding restaurant. +1 star. ------------- (Original review) Sacrilege! I'm only giving Bouley 4 stars!! I went there for lunch about a month ago with my boyfriend: I'd known about the place for a long time and had been dying to check it out, so I finally decided to splurge. First the place is really interesting. I really like the vestibule, in which the walls are covered with shelves of fresh apples: the scent is really strong and is unlike anything I've seen before... you have to experience it to know what I mean. The restaurant itself is fairly nice: large dining room with red walls, quaint furniture and decoration (I'd have thought myself in my grandma's dining room in France), but all tasteful and also comfortable. The service was a little bit too formal and cold, even after they realized I was French, but it was also very attentive and helpful so I am not complaining. We both ordered the $48 tasting menu, which has about 5 or 6 dishes and was overall quite delicious. I was a little put off my the main course (the chef's canape), which had Roquefort sorbet in it (and I just cannot eat Roquefort), but all the other dishes were great. I can't recall in every detail what we had, but it went from scallops to eggs to duck to pork... and I don't think we had one single bad dish. As pointed out by the other reviewers, they also great bread (I need to check out their bakery next time I'm in town), which they serve to you from a cart that roll to your table a various points during the meal. We left very full after about two hours, and I was ready for a nap at that point. Why not 5 stars? I is definitely not a cheap place (which I knew was going to be the case, so it's fine), but I expected to be more wowed than I was. Don't take me wrong: this was a great lunch. Maybe my expectations were just too high since I'd been waiting to go for such a long time. So it's really more a 4-1/2 stars, and I'm sure I'll give it another try sometime soon.",1
3115,490,4,3/11/2008,"It was great, but was it one of the top 10 greatest meals i've ever had? Â Unfortuneately not. Â Nothing was bad or disappointing. Â The desserts kept on coming which i love, but i wasn't wowed-although my dad was once the check arrived. Â The service is incredible, but be prepared to have a leisurely meal. Â I came right from the gym (showered of course) but was starved. Â The meals are spaced out quite a bit so it wasn't until 10pm that i actually ate my little piece of seabass entree. Â Trully a place for special occasions but i see no need to repeat.",1
4869,490,5,3/6/2008,"Had a wonderful prix fixe lunch that I considered an absolute steal based on the level of service and top notch ingredients.

3061,490,5,2/24/2008,"it's kinda incredibly pricey (for an avg college student) and a tad exotic for a place you'd go to any more than once a month, even if you really love it. the service was almost overdone. maybe it was because there weren't many people there at the time i went (a Saturday at 11am). but it almost became uncomforting to have my every move watched. it really wasn't necessary to move the table each time someone in my party wanted to get up to go to the bathroom. it really wasn't necessary to refill my plate with deliciously flavored bread each time i picked up my last piece. but it was thoughtful, and though they are paid to do it, it was sweet. the actual place was pretty damn beautiful. it really felt like being in a wing of a mansion in southern france. i enjoyed the fresh baskets of flowers and the soft pillows more than the food.",1
4870,490,5,2/19/2008,"Hands down my favourite restaurant in this city... impeccable I mean drop dead impeccable service... have always made reservation 2-3 days ahead and they have always accommodated me. I have dropped in for brunch and been taken care of and quite well, what is also really cool is once they get you into their system the service becomes a bit more personal. And as much as I miss Lutece... I was never asked to wear some old moldy jacket that didn't fit me... I once went to dinner wearing a hat and just a cardigan and converse, but they didn't bat an eye. Concerning the food... he has such an inventive menu, classic American ingredients with a Nouveau French approach.... the Black Cod and Coddled Egg is amazing... and his desserts take the cake, no pun intended. On my second visit I took a friend for her birthday, they made her a special little cake [not on the menu], and presented it on White Chocolate Snow..... seriously intense, that night they plied us with champagne and wine, and mysteriously it did not show up on the bill. I have never left hungry after having an appetizer, a main, and then sharing a dessert. All in all Impeccable... come to think of it I think I need a fix.",1
4871,490,5,2/4/2008,"Bouley is hard for me to rate because I don't get to go to this kind of restaurant very often. I've been to Bouley twice, and each time I had some dish that really made me think, with tremendously concentrated flavors and textures juxtaposed in novel, interesting ways. The comment ""portions were far too small"" just misses the point. Last time, I ordered squab, which turned out to be deboned pieces of squab, combined with (I recall) foie gras in a kind of sushi roll with savoy cabbage rather than seaweed on the outside. This combination, which was extremely interesting to me texturally and flavor-wise, was simply not something I could have dreamed up on my own, let alone executed. It gave my palate something to think about. Now, there may be other restaurants in New York which top Bouley at this kind of high-end gastronomy. I wouldn't know, because I can't afford to go to them. There are some aspects of the Bouley experience which perplex me. What's up with the bread cart? Sending around a cart with different kinds of bread seems like a gimmick worthy of Olive Garden. The bread really isn't all that good. Also not very good is the little cake they give you as a going away present. A promotion for Bouley bakery, I suppose.",1

Which is why, this year, my favorite Washingtonian and I took her to Bouley for a proper commemoration. The heady scent of apples greeted us as we stepped inside. The Â small bar near the entrance was overwhelmed with patrons waiting for tables to be turned over. Had I been one of the folks assigned to coat check duty I'd have surely lost it, or fainted and fallen to my death on top of an umbrella. Not the Bouley coat clerks, though. Amazingly, they kept their calm. Even after my doppelganger panicked and had to get them go back in the coat room and fetch her i-phone. Once seated, the fun began. My doppelganger and my favorite Washingtonian ordered the wine pairings. I vowed to sip from their glasses. I absolutely loved the: Phyllo Crusted Florida Shrimp, Cape Cod Baby Squid, Scuba Dived Sea Scallop and Sweet Maryland Crabmeat, Ocean Herbal Broth And the highlight of my night was the: Texas Pink Grapefruit Soup infused with Green Cardamon, Star Anise And Tahitian Vanilla with Campari Sugar and Fromage Blanc Sorbet If you're looking for a splurge, special occasion, let's do it up right kind of experience, Bouley is it. Service is impeccable and doesn't end when you leave the table. When my doppelganger asked for the wine pairings, the sommelier took her email address and promised to send them.

I had eaten there once and enjoyed it but my mind hadn't been blown enough to warrant spending that type of cash. Generally speaking it was delicious as most things that are over 30 dollars are, but it's just not worth it. Ultimately that's what the problem here is, for the amount of money you are spending, the quality and flavors just aren't up to snuff. I know this guy is celebrated, but I much prefer The Modern.

Posted on 01-16-2008 by cmaimone In this day and age of Greenmarket / Haute / BBQ / Tapas restaurant models, the city's New French cuisine venues have somehow gotten lost in the fog. Refresh your memory by experiencing what is arguably the best lunch deal in the city today. I had a 2pm reservation at Bouley and spent the next hour and a half in sheer awe of the culinary artistry of David Bouley's kitchen and Viennese Pastry Chef Alex Grunert's unprecedented creations. I had absolutely no criticism of any dish I devoured. What I ordered was not only perfectly executed and promptly served; the restaurant also showered me with free extra courses and sides to my delight.

4874,490,5,1/7/2008,"MY BEST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!! There is no words to express how how felt last saturday night at Bouley! For a French food lover in NY everything is just perfect! The cosy atmosphere, the service, the 50kind of free different breads you are offered to taste several times during your diner, the candles, the flower, the presentation in the plates, the color, the research of the perfect matching wine for each dishes chosen .... and I could go like that for ever!!! I had the degustation menu. My husband as well and we have shared each of our plate so at the end we have tasted about 10 different dishes !!! And you would think that because it is a degustation menu the portions are going to be small ! NOT AT ALL !! Â Half way from the end of diner we were already full!!! I will go there again and again for any big occasion in my life !",1
4875,490,5,1/1/2008,"Wow...so satisfied. And I am in love with the pastry chef. I wish I could give all these stars to the pastry chef. FOOD: Simply based on the prix fixe lunch we recently had...everything except for the main entree (cod, which was slightly too salty) and the accompanying mashed potato was flawlessly delicious, especially the bread/pastries and the series of desserts. They bombarded us with three separate servings of sweets. All 5-star quality. No wonder the Bouley bakery next door is always packed with carb-lovers like me. SETTING & SERVICE: I love the sweet aroma of apples at the entrance...and the cozy, red decor. The service was exceptionally well coordinated, although the staff was not the most approachable. SUM: tentatively, 4.5 stars...just so that we'd have a reason to go back again (and again) to make better assessments!",1

I haven't had the chance yet, but Upstairs at Bouley has drawn rave reviews from many friends of mine, so I'll give that a shot instead. Â Apparently its a very different menu and quite a bit better.

From the second you step in the door the host greets you with warmth and humor and zero attitude (how un-French of him). The room is cozy and muted yet so funky and interesting in it's way. The staff are all, without exception, impeccable with their, again, lack of attitude, timing, friendliness, good humor, etc., etc,. The food was perfect, perfect, perfect . . . perfect.

2863,490,4,12/13/2007,"Foie gras: 3 Everything else: 4 Went on a weeknight just to get the foie gras appetizer. I looove seared foie gras to death, and I thought the $28 splurge was worth it. Well... almost. Everything else was wonderful except the foie. I had two huge lobes of foie on top of a fruit puree with one dollop of fruit to the side. Somehow I didn't think this was anywhere near the best foie gras I've ever tasted. I don't think it was seared the way I liked it, I like it slightly crispy outside, with plenty of sweet sauces accompanying it. It also didn't come with bread, which is really annoying. You just can'e eat foie without some sort of carbs on the table. Foie gras: 3, even though portions were huge. I actually got sick eating it all. Besides that, the server was nice given that I only ordered one dish. I got an amuse bouche that was made of beets and horseradish foam: 2 eghh... pretty sour and gross. The bread they give you is pretty nice, you can select from several and the apple bread they give you in the beginning is pretty and tasty: 4. I didn't order dessert, but they gave us a plate of little candies. I was way too full to eat the dessert. It was strange since all I had was an appetizer... of pure fat! It came with two tiny miniature muffins, a tiny macaroon, fruit gel, truffle, and some crispy thing. Haven't eaten any yet, but I'm sure they're tasty. Then as we are leaving a lady stops us and gives me this cute little lemon loaf. Didn't eat that yet either. So overall a pleasant experience, but the foie was quite disappointing. It just didn't taste good... I don't know how else to say it. I felt kind of sick after eating the first lobe. Its sad, but I don't think i want to eat foie for another 3 months, because of this experience.",1
4878,490,5,12/10/2007,"I've been looking forward to Sunday evening all week. My fiancee and I have been planning on Bouley dinner for our ""Holiday Treat""... Â All week, I've been carefully studying the menu, too. The biggest dilemma was, tasting menu or a la carte?? And of course, I wondered how was I going to Yelp this place?? (How was I going to describe the food? The experience? And *gasp* God forbid, what if I didn't like Bouley??) There's already so many reviews (good and bad) and well, I wanted my review to be thoughtful and insightful, too. But at this point, I'm just going to gush about how much I love Bouley! I love food. I love eating. I eat out a lot. (My credit card bill list usually looks like the Yellow Pages section for restaurants!) But, it's not everyday, you get top DINING EXPERIENCE like one does at Bouley. A Michelin 2 star restaurant! Yes, the food is WONDERFUL. You get to try some amazing culinary creations that border on at genius level. I felt like I was one of the panel judges on Iron Chef! (Which is my dream job, actually.) I was excited at the sight of the infamous bread cart and my mouth started watering as soon as I walked in! It could have been the apple scent that greeted us or something but my appetite kicked up a notch. The restaurant is so romantic, on top of that. Gorgeous decor... Loved the barrel ceiling, so old European! I felt bad for my fiancee because he got the view of the wall... But, then, someone's gotta take one for the team! There were so many beautiful and rich looking people, I almost felt out of place but hey... as they say, When in Rome... Anyway, the service was phenomenal. I could really get used to service like this! I ended up getting the tasting menu and was very pleased. One thing that did mar my experience is that they didn't have pork on the tasting menu. And half the time, I gazed longingly at the organic pork that was sitting two tables away. Next time, I'm getting the pork! Overall, I highly recommend Bouley. It is one of my favorite places for high end dining in NYC. (Right up there on my list with Gary Danko's in SF and Charlie Trotter's in Chicago.)",1
4879,490,3,12/3/2007,"I wanted something special for my husband's bday -- thought this looked fancy and hyped-up enough.... So here's my gripe: walk in and see maitre'd Â bitching out staff and snipping at them in the shadows. See staff cower, and pretend to be nice because their mean boss just yelled at them... Crowd looks 70 (on average) lots of white hair, lots of white everything -- and drafty inside. We had the chef's tasting menu + a bottle of champagne and it came out to over $400 - not really sure it was worth it. Would have liked a cozy, romantic vibe - but felt a stuffiness I didn't like.",1
4880,490,5,11/27/2007,"The bf took me here for a surprise bday dinner and we had a fabulous time. I loved the apple entryway but it didn't match the somewhat old fashioned dining room. All of the service is friendly and attentive - from the coat check to the waiter. Â For example, the tables all have a lamp or candle to add to the ambiance but I almost tripped over the cord on the way to the restroom. Our waiter crawled around to hide the cord and assisted me when I returned to my seat. Now for the main event. Although tempting, we were not hungry enough for the tasting menu and I'm glad cause with all the extras we were stuffed. Â The bread was good, with an impressive variety. The amuse that came first was interesting but not something I'd ever order - basically beet gelee and creme fraiche. The Return from Chang mai lobster was fresh and unique though some of the textures were a little odd - tasted like pate in the middle. The sashimi tuna did not taste as fresh, and wasn't anything special. We had the duckling and the lamb chops. Both were very good, especially the perfectly tender duck. I thought the lamb was a bit more game-y than I prefer but the bf loved it. They also gave use complimentary potato puree which was good but too buttery for my tastes. We waited a pretty long time for our entres but I was kinda full by then anyway. For dessert we ordered the chocolate frivolous despite being full. They gave us a tiny dessert with curry ice cream and pineapple that was good. The frivolous turned out to be a sampling platter which we couldn't finish. Lastly, a plate of petit fours came out which we bravely sampled but again could not finish. On the way out they gave us a lemon cake. It was a little dry (the next day) and I'm not a big fan of lemon but it was a nice gesture. So all the desserts we tried were all good but lacked a 'wow' factor. Overall the food was great, although some of the 'extra' dishes were not good enough to eat more of. I would give the food 4 stars but the amazing service and great company made the experience a 5.",1
4881,490,5,10/24/2007,"I have been to a few 2 star Michelin places and Bouley far surpassed the other restaurants. Â As everyone has mentioned, there are apples lining the walls when you and the aroma when you enter is amazing (but arguably better as you are leaving). Â The most important tip i can give you is to come late. Â I was surprised that it was very loud when we entered (around 8:30) but it quickly quieted down around 9. Â These are the things we tried...appetizers: Return from Chang mai (excellent!), the sashimi tuna (very good), and the oysters (good, but not memorable)...entrees: salmon (it was really fresh, literally melted in your mouth), lobster (good, Â but the sauce didn't add that much to the lobster), lamb (i didn't taste it), kobe beef (great, but not extroardinary)....desserts: creme brulee (excellent, a step above any creme brulee i've had), chocolate souffle (didn't try), Chocolate Frivolous (really really good). Â  Overall Bouley was excellent. Â The staff was friendly (they were not pretentious although we were three 25 year olds). Â The wine list was excellent with many French wines and wines starting at about 50 dollars. Â Every dish was served for each person at the same time (no awkward waiting while dishes are getting cold). Â The meals were amazing, the meat quality was very good and each dish seemed to melt in your mouth. Â The desserts were a highlight, they KEEP giving you more little free desserts.

Every meal I've had here has been incredible and the best part is the little gift they give you as you leave - a bag of cookies or teacakes or some other little treat, wrapped beautifully in a goody bag. I always ordered the short version of the lunch tasting menu and always left stuffed - it's more than enough food, especially for lunch. My favorite dish here is the prawn in phyllo nest. The flavors are sublime. You're supposed to order the chocolate souffle here, and I do, but not for the souffle (which is a bit too rich for me) - for the five tiny scoops of different flavored ice creams that accompany it.",1
4884,490,2,8/14/2007,"In what I am guessing may be a rather unwise decision, I am choosing to do my first Yelp review on Bouley - a restaurant that I did not particularly enjoy. Â I realize I am risking ever-lasting hatred for this (esp. in light of all of the previous glowing reviews), but it has been one of my least favorite dining experiences in NYC so far. Â Sad but true. I chose Bouley as a dinner destination when my very best friend came to see me from Houston. Â We have a tradition of eating well (read: being willing to spend a lot of money for good food and drink) when we're together, and after perusing Yelp, I figured Bouley was THE place to go for us. Â So we headed down to the restaurant one Saturday evening. Â  I love the doors and the way the place looks from outside - very French provincial - but that was about the only thing I really liked. Â We were seated quickly and I immediately began to wonder if we had accidentally ended up at someone's Great Aunt Thelma's house. Â There were lacy doiley things and lots and lots of flowers in what I thought were rather traditional and boring arrangements. Â Everything felt very busy and old to me, in terms of decor. Â I kept expecting the scent of moth balls to start wafting toward me. But that didn't happen. Â Instead, our waiter showed up and we began the business of ordering. Â We both opted for the Prix Fixe menu. Â Right of the bat, I was unimpressed with the waiter. Â He was smarmy and a bit stand-offish, and seemed to be...smirking at us, really, he was. Â Granted, my friend and I both look young, but I am within months of 30 and she is nearly 29. Â We're not old by any means (esp. compared to the decor of Bouley), but we're not college kids either. Â  The food came. Â To make a long story short, I disliked everything except for some ricotta filled gnocchi that came about half-way through the meal. Â The wine was ""eh"" at best. Â  I must grant that my friend rather liked the meal - thus, 2 stars, because at least half of my party was satisfied - but I truly did not. Â Maybe I' m not sophisticated enough? Â  Whatever. Â In the end, I can think of Â A LOT of better ways to spend nearly $200. Â I realize that many people (obviously) love this place, but if you don't, be aware that you are not alone. Â Maybe it makes me ghetto or tacky or unclassy, but I would rather east fast food than Bouley. Â Seriously. Â Forgive me for my transgressions.",1
4885,490,4,8/12/2007,"I am lowering my review from 5 to 4 stars after an exceptional meal at Annisa. Â Bouley was great, but out of date and over-priced. Â The taste and value at Annisa cannot be beat, and the restaurant is yet to be discovered. Â  =============================== I ate here two years ago and still refer to it as the best meal of my life. Â I anxiously await a special occasion worthy of returning. The tasting menu with wine pairing is a must. Â The meal gave me a whole new appreciation for food. Â The food or wine served alone would have been excellent. Â But the pairing - oh the pairing - is so brilliant your whole body will tingle. Â  I'm somewhat of a cheap person, and I was happy to put down $200 (including tip, but this was 2 years ago) for this meal.",1
4886,490,4,8/8/2007,"I went there for a firm-sponsored dinner, so I may have lost out on some of the intimacy Bouley could offer. Â We were each treated to the tasting menu - a series of rich small-portioned and palate cleansers. Â The only thing I would stay away from is the squab. Â To be fair, I had no idea what a squab actually looked like, aside from the fact that it was a bird. Â Squab meat is practically red meat (which I don't eat) and Bouley serves it up with a hunk of fat, all rolled up in cabbage. The other courses, however, were great. Â I like the bread cart that rolled around initially that allowed you to sample different types of bread (and as may different types as you want). Â I also really enjoyed the dessert options. Â The service met expectations - a coworker was vegetarian and they accommodated her at almost every course. Â However, at other times, there seemed to be frivolous attentiveness when you didn't need it, but no attention when you actually did need it. Â  At the end of the meal, everyone received a small lemon loaf to take home. Â I'm not sure if dinner is the better deal (it appears a very similar tasting menu is offered for lunch), but this place would be great to bring a significant other on an occasion. Â As part of a large-group professional dinner, I almost fell asleep from the low lighting and wine.",1

4888,490,5,7/29/2007,"This 2-star Michelin Rated restaurant is absolutely divine. Â The service, atmosphere, and food all deserve 5 Yelp stars. Â Plus, for lunch, it is an amazing deal. Â  Atmosphere: As many other Yelp-ers noted, the first foyer is an apple-decorated room that smells just like freshly picked apples. Â The decor is charmingly French with striped sofas along the walls and gilded chairs. Â Fresh flowers and unique lamps adorn each table. Service: Always at your beck and call, not snooty or pretentious at all. Food: Absolutely outstanding with lots of extras! Â Plus, the portions are very sizable for a multi-course meal. Â Lunch has a la carte or 2 prix fixe options for $38 (5-course meal) or $48 (6-course meal). Â The prix fixe is definitely worth it since each entree is about $35+ on its own. 1st course: Chef's canape Today, the chef's amuse-bouche was a tomato gazpacho with a spoonful of tomato sorbet 2nd course: Choice of sashimi tuna or a seafood mix. Â I opted for the seafood mix in an ""ocean broth."" Â It was quite rich and absolutely divine. Â Very heavy on the butter though, as typical of French cuisine. Â My companion got the tuna and it was a pretty large portion of tuna (about 4 inches in diameter. 3rd course: Choice of cod, salmon, halibut, skate, or chicken (depending on your tasting menu). Â The cod was good with a light pattering of truffle sauce. Â Portion was huge -- I could've eaten just the cod and nothing else, and I would've been full. 4th course: The $38 meal doesn't have a 4th course, but the $48 has a choice of duck, suckled pig or another meat dish (I forgot). Â My companion tried the suckled pig. Â Again, the portion was huge for a multi-course meal, and it was quite flavorful. 5th course: Honeydew melon with ricotta sorbet. Â Very refreshing. 6th course: Choice of chocolate souffle with 3 scoops of ice cream (chocolate, hazelnut, vanilla) or apricot tart with basil ice cream. Â Both very good, though the basil ice cream made the apricot tart the more interesting dish. Extras: They give you an assortment of 10 different types of bread, all equally delicious. Â Dessert also came with a complimentary passionfruit parfait from the dessert chef as well as bite-sized desserts. Â Finally, they gave parting gifts to the ladies -- lemon cakes. All in all, one of the best meals I've had in the city, and I would highly recommend this for lunch to anyone. Â  (Other notes: Dinner is a different story -- a little too expensive for my tastes at $98 prix fixe. Â Also, note that this is not the same guys who owns Daniel. Â The restaurant Daniel is owned by Daniel Boulud. Â This is David Bouley -- also owner of the Danube.)",1
4889,490,5,7/25/2007,"I couldn't decide between four or five stars. Â There are other places I like better, but Bouley is one of the best in terms of service, decor, and food. Â We went there and had the tasting menu last winter which featured black truffles quite a bit, I guess they were in season. Â I can't even remember the specifics of our meal, except to say that it was sensational. Â I even tried some types of fish I had never tried before and they were perfectly cooked. Â The scene is somewhat woodsy (awesome apple entryway decoration), but very elegant. Â It's a fairly intimate setting and I would feel lucky to get to go back there.",1
4890,490,5,7/23/2007,"They foyer on our visit was doubling as storage space for ... apples! They were artfully shelved floor to cieling and it smelled divine! Interesting idea. We were seated in the white room - I had hoped for red, if you reserve a seat ask for your preference. The staff is very attentive which is good but sometimes overbearing when you want to savor that last bite and someone is already all fired up to snatch the bowl from under your nose. The whole lingering over food thing is something you have to reclaim and be assertive about here. One of the waiters, a tall black man, I forget his name, kept recommending things (we were doing the tasting menu with wine). He had me change my mind about a few things and I was very glad I did. He also spoke very well about the wine, and when he introduced our wine for each tasting it was a treat and enhanced the experience. I'm the type of person who has little education with wine, so it is nice to have someone who can tell you in clear language (not the poem-y abstract bologna that a lot of people use to impress or intimidate those who don't know as much about wine) what to look out for while you are tasting it, I like that bit of eduacation. I wish I could remember his name, because you should seek him out as he really knows his stuff and talking to him about the food and wine really ups your experience of it, and his recommendations are not to be ignored. Every course we were hoping he would be the one to pour the wine (I was anyway). First course: Phyllo Crusted Florida Shrimp, Cape Cod Baby Squid, Scuba Dived Sea Scallop Sweet Maryland Crabmeat in an Ocean Herbal Broth Or Sashimi Quality Tuna with Shaved Fennel Dressed in Herb Oils and a Spicy Marinade The waiter made me get the first, my fiance had the 2nd. I must say mine was amazing, the better dish and NOT TO BE MISSED!!! The broth is beautiful, that word makes you resist, because it sounds like soup, but it is a brilliant green sauce, not a soup as I was expecting. The seafood of course (not usually my thing at all) was delectable. The main courses were also wonderful. The pre-dessert was a cold strawberry soup paired with a sake that was the most perfect pairing I've ever had! My beau is an Austrian, as is their dessert chef, so we were treated to every dessert on the menu! They were all outstanding, but the meringue was particularly memorable. As everyone raves about, the bread is wonderful, and they sent us home with a teacake which was very tasty. Not being residents of this fine city, we were relegated to pairing it with crappy Starbuck's coffee next day because we couldn't find any real coffee.",1

4892,490,5,7/13/2007,"I visited Bouley for lunch and was very happy with the fact that we went there early during they day since I am particular about not eating late. It was nice and quiet in the restaurant. Low ceilings and drapes made the dining room very cozy. As we walked into the restaurant, we walked through a small room which had wooden boxes with apples on the side. The smell of apples filled the room and in combination with warmth and soft yellow light transported me to a summer cottage where my grandmother would pick apples from her trees. The food was rich and tasty. Sashimi tuna appetizer was delicious and the main entree warm sea bass was yummy. When it came time for desert I really wished I had saved more space for it. Nonetheless I tasted everything that came to the table. The warm apricot meringue, the tomato sorbet, the cold layered fusion and a number of small treats.

I still can recall the lobster I had there in 2004 when I went with three others. We had at least 12 courses with the wine pairing. My head was spinning from all the indulgence. It was so luxurious and decadent. After the 3 or so hour meal, we were given a tour of the kitchen which was a great treat. Speaking of treats, we were each given a small loaf of bread to take home as a parting gift. Bouley truly set a high bar for later gastronomic adventures. Missing a star because it's not THE gem of all my fine dining experiences, but still worth a return visit.",1
4896,490,5,6/16/2007,"Being from the UK, I've only managed to eat at Bouley 3 times but it's an absolute pilgrimage for me on my annual trip to New York/New Jersey to ride roller coasters. The restaurant is about a minute's walk from Chambers Street station on the 1,2,3,9 line. The area seems safe enough though I've only ever been here in the daytime. On my most recent trip in May of this year, I took a walk round the block as I had arrived early for my lunch appointment and looked at the other businesses that David Bouley is creating - Danube with its more Austrian menu and the bakery. Both looked lovely but I still stick by the French inspired original restaurant. Speaking to the maitre d', the restaurant is relocating to the building in the next block in September of this year and I hope that they keep the lovely decor, ambience and of course the food when they move. Behind the big solid wooden door, you're transported into a refined and sophisticated atmosphere. The waft of fresh apples found in baskets in the entrance hallway is an inspired move to welcome you and also to stimulate the appetite. Dress is smart casual but I've seen guests dressed in smarter and less smart clothing and no-one is made to feel out of place. The waiting staff has a large French brigade. Service is always smart, attentive and knowledgeable. I've had the privilege to have eaten in great restaurants across 3 continents and Bouley remains firmly in my top 3. The kitchen shows an almost Japanese-like approach to its food - the absolute confidence and belief in top-class ingredients to use a few ingredients well and get them to sing and harmonise on the plate without drowning each other out. The flavour combinations are well thought out, cooking techniques impeccable and presentation top-class. I've always been tempted by the gorgeous sounding creations on the a la carte menu (can anyone tell me what Return to Chiangmai tastes like?) but have always settled for the tasting menu at lunchtime which represents fantastic value and allows me to try more dishes. For this visit, I started with a glass of freshly squeezed OJ which is surprisingly hard to get in classy restaurants. the bewildering choice of 7 different breads were of the highest calibre as usual but I knew to pace myself and not fill up too quickly with the feast to follow! The started of tomato sorbet, tomato gelee and gazpacho was just that - a hit of pure tomato flavour with the gelee to add textural variety. Perfect palate cleanser. I went for an appetizer that I had enjoyed before - a mixture of generous sized seafood, some with a phyllo crust to add crunch, offset by an ocean herb broth. The sweetness of the seafood was allowed to be the star with the herb broth subtly complementing it. The fish course of wild king salmon came with a dramatic sauce made with blood orange as well as clementines and mandarins but again, this didn't overpower the delicate taste of the salmon. I had had the opportunity to chat to the maitre d' as I arrived right at the start of service and he very kindly sent over an extra course of Chatham cod which was equally delicious. The main course of pork was sensational - 2 different cuts but both cooked to melting tenderness yet retaining the earthy tones of pig. I haven't seen it often on the menu but grab it while you can if it appears on the menu! Another sorbet to cleanse the palate and the meal was finished off with hot Valrhona chocolate souffle. The souffle was a lovely mini size as I was starting to panic about not being to eat it as I was pretty full by now. It came with the loveliest trio of different Â and distinctively flavoured ice creams. Although I didn't have coffee, I was delivered a plate of delightful petit fours. Another absolutely top notch meal! New Yorkers go and eat there! Keep up the great work guys, good luck with the move and keep up the standards at the new place! As Arnie said, I'll be back!",1

Â The waiter brought a dessert our table that we didn't order, and didn't skip a beat when we said something. Â He just put it on the table and said ""from the chef."" Â Now, I know that this often happens at high end restaurants, but in this case it was clearly good service making amends for a mistake.

Â Lunch was long, almost two hours. Â The service was very good, attentive (almost too attentive?). Â The portions were a good size because I had room to eat at least some of everything presented.

4900,490,4,4/11/2007,"Through the arched wooden door, pass the aromatic entrance of New York apples and seated under baroque coved crimson ceilings, the true experience of Bouley ignites once you have determined which of the two tasting menus set to make your day. Â Garnering an impressive and the only 29 out of 30 rating from Zagat, David Bouley's French heritage brings a classic foundation to new forms in cooking techniques that celebrates each ingredient as its own. Â The chef's canape could easily replace the minced tuna with shaved fennel option, when my palette was invigorated from the pairings of celery sorbet and marscapone cheese with Granny Smith foam and a touch of mint. Â It brought a nice transition to the following dish of tenderly pan seared seafood. Â Even laid atop an herbal broth, the scallop, squid, and crabmeat held their own flavors, while the phyllo crusted shrimp held a tougher texture. Â I was hoping my dining companion did not want to swap as I was convinced the Chatham Cod was the better choice with the early seasonal introduction of spring peas. Â Like the after-taste of freshly squeezed orange juice gone sour, the grapefruit gelee tattered the pleasant traces from the roasted maitake and buttermilk chicken dish I was so hesitant to trade for. Â But the sourness was soon forgotten once presented with the Molten-like Valrhona chocolate souffle adorned with maple, vanilla ice cream, and chocolate sorbet. Â Moments later, our spoons were sampling the sweet version of our savory canape of chocolate cream, espresso gelee, and spiced foam. Â  We felt like we had won the dessert lottery when our table barely had room for the silver tray of petit-fours and walking out the same door with a lovely gift bag from the Bouley bakery. If not for the colorful floral arrangements adorning the room or the assorted samplings from the bread cart, Bouley is sure to brighten any mood. p.s. just know that the servers don't hesitate to keep pouring your beverage - even without asking - so they can charge you multiple $9 bottled water.",1
4901,490,5,4/8/2007,"I just had Easter lunch here today and it is AMAZING. Â Blows Danube out of the water. Food: Chef's Canape of celery sorbet, almond foam and marscapone cheese. Sashimi tuna with miso dressing and something else. Sauted foie gras with black truffles and fig Colorado lamb with ricotta gnocchi and mint reduction (table was also given a side of potatoe puree which was SALTY) Rubarb soup with blanc sorbet Strawberry ""shortcake"" (foam gelee) with rose petal sorbet Banana something amuse Other items which I did not get; but, tasted from my mother were an asparagus soup and lobster.

4902,490,5,3/15/2007,"The first time I walked into BOULEY, I felt as if I had arrived at ""Home"" in Paris. Â The apple aroma wafting in the air was intixicating and Â the red vaulted ceiling was captivating. Â I love the decor as it really does evoke France at its most comforting. Â Charming bouquets at each table and adorable chandeliers add that French finish. Â BOULEY is really a refined place for lunch with best friends, especially girlfriends who love to splurge and have lavish attention along withfine food. Didier is an incredibly nice gentleman and excellent GM/Maitre d'. Â He really makes people feel special and he knows how to be attentive to everyone. The wait staff is very professional and friendly, no snooty attitudes. Everytime I have lunched here it has been sublime and the amuse bouche are always excellent. Â The little touches add up to a grand experience. Â We were celebrating my birthday and we were presented with a fine dessert wine, similar to a sauternes - how lovely! Â After our desserts were served, a lovely creme brulee was brought to the table with a petite candle in a raspberry and ""Happy Birthday"" written in chocolate. Â All those extra flourishes were a gift of the house. The prix fixe is the way to go for lunch as it is always eequisite. If I lived in NYC it would be my choice for celebrations - any and all celebrations. Â I'll just have to fly from the Right Coast for a Bouley Fix! The Bouley Bag is a lovely surprise as a parting gift.",1

Remember the food being excellent (but can't for the life of me remember what I ate). I do remember, that I adored the foyer full of citris. Mmm... Will have to go back to see if I remember correctly, and if this should really be a 5. Wasn't this useful?",1
4906,490,5,2/13/2007,"This is old school fine dining at its finest. I've tried almost everything on their menu from the summer of 2006, and while most of the dishes didn't rise to the sort of level that leaves a permanent memory with me, they were across the board solid. Â Furthermore, they served a seafood appetizer (phyllo wrapped shrimp, with squid and pan seared scallop in broth) that was truly sublime, and which did leave a permanent memory with me. Â Savory perfection. Everything about this restaurant makes you feel like you're sitting first class all the way. Â During one of my visits, a waiter accidentally spilled a tiny bit of sauce on the jacket of one of my dining companions. Â The waiter's supervisor came out and apologized profusely, appearing genuinely concerned. Â He promised to pay the dry cleaning fees, and when my friend indicated that he didn't have a dry cleaner in the city yet, he recommended one to him that he felt was that best in the city. Â He appeared very sincere, and overall service at Bouley is a class act all the way.",1
4907,490,5,1/29/2007,"Everything was AMAZING from the decor, to the food, to the service but they should really warn you about the small portions. I was surprised to see that the appetizer and main entree were about the same size. I'm sure that even with the small portions they have never seen two females eat so much. We ordered one tasting menu and an extra entree plus three desserts. For the starters, phyllo crusted FL shrimp, squid, and sea scallop then return from Chang Mai. These two really were phenomenal in taste and presentation. The part that I was a little disappointed in was my lamb entree. I had expected to have at least half a rack, instead I ended up with two pieces of meat that were very small. Thank goodness they had potato puree = mashed potatoes which helped to fill me up. Regardless, both the lamb and squab were amazing in taste. For dessert, chocolate souffle, rice pudding, and pineapple meringue. The chocolate souffle was the best I have ever had. Another thing that was great was a beet sorbet with some type of cheese that we had to start. I'm not a big fan of beets but this item was very tasty! Overall I really enjoyed my experience. I felt the restaurant was a little stuffy but it was a nice gesture to leave with something from their market. Next time I'm going to sit in the red room...it seemed prettier.",1
1120,490,5,1/19/2007,"I absolutely love this restaurant! I loved everything about it- the ambience, the food, the service- it was all amazing. I ordered the tasting menu and the food was delicious. My main course was a duck breast that was absolute perfection. I loved the different varieties of breads that they had to offer as well- I almost filled myself up on bread alone! (I also loved the cart that they rolled around to serve the breads) Our server was beyond attentive and I couldn't find a flaw in the entire night. I highly recommend this restaurant for special occasions- it's top of the line all the way.",1
4908,490,5,12/15/2006,"had a stellar dinner with exceptional service this week. the setting is elegant with vaulted cielings and a deep red color. they took very good care of us, and there were complimentary items from the chef to start and end the meal, which is always a plus. as a starter, the new york state foie gras was to die for, with an enormous portion, even for two people. i had the baby pig as my entree, which was nice, but not exciting. my companion had the lobster with the fricassee, which she absolutely loved. really not much to say except it was an excellent meal and i hope to go back. i was pretty sauced by the time i left, and i thought it would be endlessly amusing to juggle some apples in the entry hall. my coordination was a little off, and the staff was not as amused as i :).",1

4910,490,5,12/4/2006,"Sure, this place may no longer be considered the best restaurant in the city, but it's still without a doubt among the best. Â I will warn you that I am slightly biased towards this place because first of all, it served me the best meal that I have ever eaten in my life up until this point (although I am sure that it will be topped relatively soon), and also because this is the place that proved to me that fine dining really is something special. Â Up until eating here I was merely a fan of fine dining, but never got to truly experience it... I read about it, I learned about it, I even went to school to be one of the people creating it, but there was always a part of me that was unsure whether or not it could really satisfy me more than an extra indulgent trip to Chinatown could. Â This was the place that proved to me that fine dining really does have the potential to be everything that I dreamed it is... that gastro-orgasms can be stretched out over the course of 2 or 3 hours without one second of lowering from heaven until it comes time to leave, and even then a feeling of satisfaction seems to linger with you on your way out the door. My parents birthdays are only a few days apart, and to celebrate both of them, we had headed to the city, planning to eat at Landmarc. Â The wait at Landmarc was about an hour so we left our number and took a walk down the street and got some coffee at the cafe owned by Bouley across the street. Â Then we walked across the street to Bouley just to take a peek at the menu. Â My mother then asked, ""You want to eat here?"" to which I replied ""it's the weekend and we don't have a reservation, besides, look how I'm dressed"" (I was wearing an over-sized white tee shirt). Â She then said ""It doesn't hurt to try"" and disappeared into the door, only to come back out and wave for me to come in. Â Once I entered, I was treated like royalty, even if I was far from dressed like it. We sat down near the bar briefly before we were seated. Â We then all ordered the tasting menu with the wine pairing, and since most of the courses had three choices, we each got different ones, except for the second course which only had two choices so we got two of one and one of the other... and we each tasted some of each others dishes and wines, although we mainly stuck to our own. Â There was not a dull moment during the whole meal, and even though we did not have a reservation, the only waiting that ever occurred was the few minutes we waited to be seated, which wouldn't of even been waiting if we had ordered a drink. Â I'm not going to bother evaluating every dish we had because there were a lot and they were all perfect. Â So were the 8 different types of bread offered to us between just about every course, and so were all the wines. Â When the desserts came (well the second course of desserts, because there were two), there were two choices for the course and instead of giving two of us one of the desserts and one of us the other, they all gave us the same one (a valrhona molten chocolate cake with three ice creams, the best molten chocolate cake I've ever had so far, and I've had a few) and gave us one of the other to share, compliments of the chef. Â As the meal came to an end, I was filled with a mixture of extreme satisfaction as well as sadness that it had to come to an end. Â From that moment forward, I look forward to the special occasions which will call for me to indulge in meals of this caliber probably just as much as I look forward to anything of great importance in life.",1
4911,490,5,5/21/2006,"This place must rate as having the best weekend brunch anywhere! Â From the moment you step inside (and smell the fragrance of fresh fruit surrounding you) and are immediately greeted and seated, you know you are in for a grand experience. Â And Bouley does not disappoint. Â The decor, the service, the food...all sublime. Â Not cheap, but worth the price of admission.",1
4912,490,4,4/7/2006,"I wish I could give half stars ere because this classic mainstay from downtown deserves three and a half, not four. They are spot on with thier food, it's exactly what you would expect from a master chef. However, the captain and sommolier were bickering at the table as to wether or not to leave the carafe. Nonetheless it was entertaining but interfered with the feeling of clean service. Nothing quite like watching a gay man and a french man argue over wine edicit in whispering voices. I mention it, because the food, although good, and perfectly fine, was simply what you would expect. Nothing, and I do mean nothing more. It felt like everything was rote, and almost ingenuine at points because it felt like all of them had been around the block a few too many times. But I do admit the tasting menu was absolutely slamming.",1

We always get the tasting menu, which doesn't change as frequently as I'd like, but thankfully i love all their dishes so i haven't really been able to complain. Their breads are fresh and good - i always end up getting one of everything - and their strawberry cloud with rose petals dessert is delicious. I also love the lemon loaf they give you at the end when you leave. Always a favorite - David Bouley at his best!",1

4915,490,5,1/9/2006,"By far one of my best dining experiences ever! Bouley was not only pleasant to look at, but the food was amazing. Fresh breads wheeled right up to your table, 7 or 8 different kinds, great choice of wines, the appetisers were light and decadent, followed by main courses to make your heart melt. My father and i went together, and tried as much as we could on the menu. Nothing was a disappointment, everything was delightful. Now if i had been paying i probably wouldn't have had so much, but since daddy picked up the tab we went all out. A must try! Michael Bouley is truly an amazing chef!",1

Â Nevertheless, we decided to give it another try and returned today (12/17/12). Â Guess what...nothing has changed. Â The food was tasteless and they are still just as rude. Â BTW, we are Puerto Rican's so we thought perhaps the food might be as good as abuela's. Â We were wrong. Â We thought if we spoke Spanish, they might be nicer. Â We were wrong.

However, it seems that each time I venture down to Casa Adela without my spanish-speaking roommate, I step through some vortex into a parallel universe. Â Instead of smiles, I am met with glares. Â I am treated like an asshole. Â No matter how nice, quiet and patient I am with the service, I am treated like a nuisance. Â It makes me wonder if they haven't mistaken me for someone who took their lunch money when they were younger. Really, I would rate this place a 4, except that when I go by my non-spanish speaking self, this place deserves 0 stars. Â So if you are fluent in Dominican or Puerto Rican spanish or can at least fake it, go for it. Â Or, if you don't mind being huffed and puffed at or outright ignored, go for it.",-1

Now I'm the only customer there except for a couple sitting at a table. Finally after about 5 to 6 (I should have left at this time) minutes a worker says did you order? I'm like is she serious.

When I finally got my order, I went home and placed them in the freezer without giving it a second thought. Long story short, Â it turns out Casa Adela did not give me any yucca pasteles at all. None! Â Not only that, the one dozen they had wrapped separately for me marking them as yucca, were not yucca at all and were filled with chicken!

Â  I have been here a handful of times now and always order the beef stew with the arroz con gandules. Normally, the service is somewhat decent, but my last time there (Monday) was wretched. I'm thinking maybe it was because of the waitress (young girl) because we had never had her before. 1. She told us they were out of arroz con gandules. We were noticeably very disappointed. However, 20 minutes later we saw her take a plate of Arroz con gandules to another table, so we asked a different waitress if they had any left. The story then changed - they had enough for one serving. No apology. 2. They were out of beef stew, my favorite dish. Who knows if they really were, because she also said they were out of Arroz con gandules. 3. We were brought salads for appetizers. Not what we ordered. The waitress realized her mistake and took them back. No apology. 4. We were dining at the restaurant, but my friend also ordered something to go so he could eat it tomorrow. Well, of course they brought it out on a plate to eat at that moment. No apology. 5. It took us 45 minutes to get our food. 45 fucking minutes. No one ever once said ""your food is on the way"" or anything. A man came in, got his meal, paid and left within 20 min while we were still waiting. There was another man that Â ordered ahead and came in to pick up his meal, but yet, he still sat there and waited 45 min. Another table was very vocal about how long it was taking for their meals to come out. Everything was just inconsistent. Listening to that table bitch and moan behind us wasn't a very great dining experience either. And of course... No apology. 6. Our meal finally comes. There's no Arroz con gandules included... after all that. I then had to remind her to bring it out. She forgot of course. No apology. 7. We ended up ordering a piece of flan to share. I shit you not, the piece of flan was probably a 2x2 square piece, even after knowing we were sharing it and we had the shittiest experience. We both got like 2 bites each out of it. That was the icing on the cake (no pun intended). Now I'm never usually this nitpicky, but there were way too many mistakes with no apologies and it really pissed me off -- enough not to return. Because of the fact I've been here a few other times and it wasn't terrible service, it saved them from getting 2 stars. Hands down the worst dining experience I've ever had.",1
4938,13,4,11/24/2014,"Awesome Puerto Rican food. I have been here three times and ordered various things off of the menu and I have never been disappointed. I ordered a mofongo and as soon as the order was put in I saw an old woman in the back (the owner?) smashing plantains in her pilon (mortar and pestle) which I thought was awesome. The waiter is so nice and friendly and makes excellent suggestions. The food takes a little longer to come out, but i'm sure its because the chef is putting the same touches on it that a family member cooking for someone would. Â The prices are great, and the ambiance of the restaurant has a hard-to-describe Puerto-Rican feel to it. There is not a lot of seating so it's not very good for large groups, but i'm sure they'd be willing to accommodate if you call in advance. After a big meal you can sit back with a cafe con leche/coffe with milk, which they make very well here. 4 stars!!",1

Â Dona Adela is always around giving instructions to his employees, which gives you a sense of her strong commitment to serving Puerto Rican food just the way it is.

4941,13,3,11/10/2014,"The reason for a 3 star review instead of a 4 star is because their serving sizes are insanely small. In terms of flavor, Adela's has truly got a special thing going on but what's the point if you can expect to leave still feeling hungry! I've eaten here twice (once was dine-in and the other time as takeout) and personally love their Bacalau Guisado (cod fish stew) but its insulting how small their servings are, especially for a latin restaurant where big portions for hearty appetites are generally the expectation. Not so here. To give you a clearer idea, they fill an average sized coffee mug to measure out a cup of rice, a cup of beans and a cup of stew before plating! They take single serving to an absurd new low for restaurant dining. I generally always offer to share my dish with friends or at the very least look forward to taking home some leftovers anytime I go out. With servings being as small as they are you can't offer to share or expect any leftovers since there isn't enough on the plate to fill your own belly. If you order the meal as take-out their portions are exactly the same and as you can imagine the food doesn't fill the containers. I wish I had a picture of how ridiculous it looked. The containers looked half empty, not half full if you get what I'm saying. So yes, the food tastes good but for what you pay you can go to many other local latin restaurants (see my other reviews) where the portions and the price are much better aligned and the food tastes just as delicious. PASS!",1
4942,13,4,11/10/2014,"This is as back home as it can get. Sub-par service: check. Plastic table covers with the Puerto Rico map place mats: check. Friends and family of the owners sitting around: check. Their food? Un-effin' believable. I always go for the mofongo and pernil, and their stuff is serious - as in, for $13 you'll have lunch and dinner in one seating. Good (and not so obvious) bonus? Its a BYOB friendly place, so you can bring your wine and beer along. Buen provecho!",1
4943,13,4,10/15/2014,Good cheap Puerto Rican food. I've had lunch here a few times since it's right by my office. There's a bit of wait for your food but everything comes fresh and piping hot.,1
4944,13,5,10/9/2014,"The mofongo is in top 5 of the best things I have ever eaten in my entire life. Literally, the flavor is out of this world. Â If you usually go with the roast chicken (or anything else) you must try the chicken stew. I'm never disappointed with the quality and deliciousness of the food.",1
4945,13,4,10/9/2014,"The best puertorican food I've ever had. I wish California had a decent ace like this. If we come back to visit NY, we will definitely come back here.",1
4946,13,5,10/8/2014,"So far I only ordered delivery but their rotisserie chicken is mind blowing. It comes with delicious rice and beans, perfectly delivered. I was keep ordering from SeÃ±or Pollo before, but Casa Adela's seasoning made me switch to them. Highly recommended.",1
4947,13,5,9/29/2014,"Still the BEST Homemade Puerto Rican food in New York City. Adela still doing her thing and looking great after a recent trip to Puerto Rico. Adela sets a great tone. Having lunch or dinner here is like eating in someone's kitchen in PR, very casual, plus the TV's always tuned to Telemundo. Whatever you order, order it with Coconut Water as your beverage -- it's very refreshing. It's great to eat among such a nice family - bendiciones a La Reina Adela y todo persones de la casa!",1
4948,13,5,9/15/2014,"I was craving mofongo one evening and luckily this place was close by. They were closing up in 15 min. so I called quickly to order take out. The people were neither very nice nor rude but my food was to go so I can't really comment too much on service. They were closing up when I got there so they could've been tired as well. When I got home, I practically devoured the entire dish, which came with some extra pork fat sauce for extra flavor. I also got the garlic sauce that everyone keeps commenting about. I will definitely be trying this place again and may even sit down for actual lunch/dinner service to try some other dishes. FYI - ordering the mofongo doesn't come with rice and beans so you'll need to order that separately.",1
4949,13,2,9/7/2014,"To summarize - disappointingly inconsistent. Â We really want to like this place, as we're Puerto Rican and there aren't too many Puerto Rican sit-down restaurants in the city. Â The girlfriend and I ate there a few months back and while she loved her dish (bacalao guisado / stewed cod fish) I thought my roast pork (pernil) was merely okay. Â  Last night I was in the mood for the bacalao guisado, so we ordered it for delivery. Â The food arrived quickly but it was bland, at best. It tasted nothing like what we had eaten our last time there. Â Making matters worse was how expensive everything was! In total, for the two orders of bacalao and an order of steak and onions, we shelled out almost $52 (including tax and tip....) Â  So, sadly, I think we're done with Casa Adela. Â For much less money, we can get much better food from Rinconcito, the Dominican restaurant on 10th street. That said, Casa Adela has some of the best coffee and flan I've ever had, so maybe I'll have to split my time between the two; Rinconcito for the entree and CA for coffee and dessert!",1
4950,13,4,8/31/2014,"Had flan and a cafecito. Delicious, creamy tasty just the right amount of everything. Will def come back to check out their meals. Jani says 5 stars for the ensalada de pulpo.",1
4278,13,3,8/12/2014,"Thought the food was ok. Place was pretty run-down. Yes it was pretty authentic puerto rican food, but honestly I have had better in many other places in this city. Ok if you are looking for that type of experience.",1
4951,13,5,8/10/2014,"The tostones were amazing... the rotisserie chicken was flavorful, pork was cooked perfectly, service was quick, and the cafe con leche was to die for.",1
4952,13,4,7/29/2014,My only regret is that I didn't come sooner I've been living in this neighborhood for a year and just tried it. Â It's serves good out of mamas Puerto Rican kitchen- get the rice and beans and rotisserie chicken. I believe senior pollo on first Avenue has better chicken with a wonderful cilantro basil sauce but nonetheless this place is delicious. Great value!!,1
4953,13,5,7/26/2014,"Well, nothing to complain about... I was walking around the area, I saw this place and I decided to come check it out whenever I was around the area again. And that was today. I was born and raised in Cuba and I have never had Puerto Rican food before, but this was YUMMY!!! The place is small, and everyone is very friendly. It feels like the kitchen of your neighbour. The service is kind of slow, if you are in a rush it's better to say it from the beginning so they know and maybe do something. Once you order, they bring you the food by parts, first the side order, then the rice and bean, the meat, and so on. Be patient. Just think you are at a friend's house. We ordered the 1/2 Chicken, and the Mofongo con Pernil... They were delicious!!!!!!! They were so good and tasty that I do not have enough words to describe it. They say the specialize in the rotisserie chicken, but the Mofongo with Pernil was AWESOME!!!! The pork was fresh and delicious. In general, if you are in the area looking for a place to eat and do not want to break the bank, GO to Casa Adela! hmmmm, maybe I'd wish the flan was a bit bigger because a little square is not enough!!!!",1
4954,13,5,7/26/2014,"Loved the mofongo, pernil and sancocho. Amazingly kind staff, great value, great place to cure a hangover or a longing for a home-cooked meal.",1
4955,13,1,7/22/2014,"I have been coming here for the past few years and every time my experience has been great but recently I was very disappointed in the service. Â After my sister and I placed our order, the waitress tells us 25 minutes later that neither of our entrees were available. So I decided on another entree and ten minutes later the waitress brings only my side orders (salad & avocado). The waitress then disappeared for some which I became really annoyed, subsequently the owner saw that I was visibly upset and apologized on behalf of the waitress which comes to find out left for the night. Since the waitress didn't relate to the cook my complete order, the owner Â offered to give me anything I wanted on the house but after sitting there starving for an hour, my sister and I decided to leave. In addition, the staff appeared unorganized and the establishment gets smaller and smaller. I won't be coming back here anymore.",1
4956,13,3,7/16/2014,"My first mofongo (with pernil) and it was delicious. Â The waitress was pretty rude, seating someone before us who she appeared to know and grabbing bottles off our table without asking. Â But the food was great.",1
1204,13,3,7/16/2014,"Still craving more puerto rican food from my last experience at ""Pasteles y algo mas"", I decided to try casa adela since it was closer to me. Yelp, I love you, but sometimes the reviews for these Â restaurants are on crack! I absolutely did not see what the big fuss was about this restaurant! Â I get better spanish food from the cuchifritos or even the grocery store sometimes! It smelled good upon walking it, but lacked authenticity. Â I ordered the chicharron de pollo with yellow rice and red beans and a side order of potato salad. Â The chicken was okay, I liked the the crust it had on it but wasn't made the traditional way. It was like they had dipped it into a batter as opposed to just frying it. The rice was normal and so were the beans. The potato salad killed me! I had high expectations that fell flat to the floor and got ran over by a truck. Absolutely nooooooo flavor whatsoever! Â I was tempted to add salt, but I just left it. The bf ordered a sancocho soup, which he said was okay and a pernil sandwich. The poor pernil sandwich was dryer than the sahara. We asked for a mojo (garlic sauce) which they seemed to forget about. They had rotisserie chickens cooking which seemed to be popular, Â but I don't know there's a thin line between jui y and dry when doing rotisserie. The waiter was really nice however, but search for puerto rican food in nyc continues.",1
4957,13,2,7/14/2014,"The restaurant was not as good as I was expecting it to be. The reviews on yelp were good, which led me to come here but my experience was not as good. I ordered a Pernil sandwich and a sancocho, the sancocho was good but the Pernil sandwich was dry. The staff was cool but a bit slow. I found the food to be ordinary and nothing special about it.",1
4958,13,5,7/9/2014,"Extremely flavorful food, despite its simplicity. I highly recommend the half chicken- which is quite literally the most delicious rotisserie chicken I've ever had (don't tell my mom!). I agree with the other postings that the wait can be a little long and the service can be a little slow, but it's well worth it. Even if I didn't live around the corner, I would make the effort whenever I was in the mood for a filling, inexpensive, Puerto Rican meal.",1
4959,13,4,5/20/2014,This was my first time trying Puerto Rican cuisine and I loved it! The restaurant is a very cute mom and pops place and you feel like you are at a family house. Everyone who worked there was very friendly and very sweet. They treated us very well and couldn't ask for better service. The food was delicious and we cleaned our plates. I would absolutely return and recommend everyone to check this restaurant out.,1
4960,13,2,5/20/2014,Food is not that great. Service sucks. They play favorites with their customers. Place is better when adela is there when she goes away look out cause when shes not there its a bust,1
4961,13,2,5/17/2014,"A nice small homey restaurant with a take-out counter and about 5 tables...yes it's very small but worth checking out if you live in the area. However if you do not, then this is really out of the way. The closest train and bus leaves you 15-20 min walk away. By the time you get there, there will be a 20-30 min wait for a table, especially on the weekends...which I wouldn't mind IF the food was out of the world...which it is certainly not. I'm not Puerto Rican but I've had much better PR food in the Bronx and on vacation in Puerto Rico. Their yellow rice is bland and not flavorful and the flan is just way off! When a spanish place doesn't get these two things right, then don't expect much from everything else on the menu. My monfongo was very good, the chicken was too dry and needed more seasoning, my friend's order of pernil with yellow rice and black beans came with more RICE than pernil; it came on a small dessert plate with 6 thin slices...where's the rest of my meal?!?! For $10 the pernil should be at least half a pound worth of meat because no one is paying $10 for rice and beans. Oh and as we were having the flan, our waiter comes up to us and goes ""sorry but we need the table after you finish your flan because it's Sat and there's people waiting""....REALLY?!?! SO the place is a long trek, dont take reservations, 20-30 mins wait only to have sub-par food and rushed to leave. And their cash only policy doesn't help either. TWO stars!",1
4962,13,5,5/16/2014,"Authentic Puerto Rican cuisine that's mouth watering! I went with my friend and we couldn't stop raving about how well seasoned the food was. Â I had chuletas frita with white rice and pink beans and my friend had 1/2 chicken with yellow rice and black beans. The prices are affordable and the service is great, I suggest you go without thinking twice!",1
4963,13,4,5/7/2014,"They get 4 stars for food, but 1 star for phone etiquette and ordering/delivery attempts via phone.",1
4964,13,5,5/2/2014,Omg!!! Let me tell you Puerto Rican food at its finest!! Pernil(pork) is so melt in your mouth moist!! Natural squeezed orange juice goes down smooth like sailin' im telling you! Hidden gem in NYC. Coming from a Puerto Rican background...this is what COMIDA should taste like!!! Bendicion y Buen Provecho!!!,1
4965,13,4,4/16/2014,"Great little spot for some delicious spanish food. It was raining out and before heading over to Pitt Street I decided to stop in for the pernil. The service was fast and friendly, didn't even need to look at the menu. I had the yellow rice with red beans and roasted pork. The pernil was very well seasoned with nice cuts of meat. The beans came in a coffee mug with a side plate of Â yellow rice! Just took some hot sauce and shook it all over the pork, in the beans and on the rice. The rice wasn't overly seasoned just needed some salt, but after the splash of hot sauce oohhh boy this food is lively. Muy bueno!!!",1
4966,13,5,3/24/2014,"Went here last Friday with my Puerto Rican boyfriend. I had the chicken stew which came with rice and beans. Delicious!!! It reminded me of my childhood when visiting friends and their Mom would put a plate in front of me and watch this Irish girl eat. I can't wait to go back. Great prices, too.",1
4967,13,5,3/22/2014,"I've been looking for a decently priced Puerto Rican restaurant for quite a while. I've been trying different places in search for a restaurant that mirrors my grandmothers' cooking because I want to invite a few of my friends that have never tried Puerto Rican food. I was born and raised in Puerto Rico so I have high standards. I'm not looking for something that looks good on a plate; I'm looking for something cheap, authentic, and delicious. Okay, enough background info. Now to the review. FOOD: I wasn't expecting much from this place but I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered pernil which came with a side of rice (white, yellow, or yellow with green peas) and beans (red, pink, or black). I went with the white rice and pink beans. I also ordered a mofongo. I shared the meal with my date and the bill came out to be around $20. The food was great and authentic; it was very similar in taste to what my grandmothers make at home when I visit them in Puerto Rico. SERVICE: The server was attentive and polite. SEATING: The place has six tables with about 20 chairs. On a busy day it might be harder to seat large groups but I went at around 6pm on a weekday and there was no wait. Overall: 5 stars! I recommend this place to anyone that wants an authentic taste of Puerto Rico in NYC. BTW, CASH ONLY!",1
4968,13,4,3/21/2014,"No-nonsense stop for Puerto Rican food - granted, I've never had Puerto Rican food in my life and have no idea what to compare it to. All I know is what I ate here was delicious as hell. A friend of mine introduced me to Casa Adela and we went and split an order of the roast pork with rice and black beans. There's a $3 charge for sharing (even though our waitress stated $2, 3 was on the bill), but we don't eat much (two Asian girls) so I didn't mind. The prices are fairly low anyway. The dish came out in a matter of minutes (pretty quick). They gave us an extra plate without us having to ask, which I always note because a lot of places, even more upscale ones, won't do that without being prompted. The beans come in a mug, which is kind of cute, and makes it easy to pour over the rice. The pork is so soft and rich, it pretty much melts in your mouth. The rice and beans are well seasoned, although I added some of the hot sauce provided at each table because I like my food to be spicy. Overall, the dish was delicious and so comforting, you'd think you'd grown up with a Puerto Rican grandmother. The place is small and casual, there's a tv running Spanish speaking television programs in the background, and you basically feel like you're in someone's house. I left thinking about my next trip back.",1
4969,13,5,3/21/2014,"I love every meal I've had there. It's my kind of place- hole in the wall with questionably sanitation but super authentic Puerto Rican. I know this bc (I have a knack for these dirty hole in the wall places) and there was a Puerto Rican family reunion taking up 75% of the restaurant and they totally said that in comparison to the more well known Puerto Rican restaurant in Bew York, they thought this was more like grandma's cooking! I loved the first and second dish - pork with rice and beans & chicken with rice and beans. Tried the mofongo but if wasn't very used to the combination of garlic with plaintains and a salty sauce. But I want to try their plaintain chips and pork chops next time! And if you bring a large group, you can split their family style rotisserie chicken (it's their customer favorite)",1
4970,13,4,2/12/2014,"Great mom and pop's place with authentic Puerto Rican food that doesn't hurt your wallet. Good attentive service with a personal touch. they also have a GREAT red pepper sauce. It definitely has kick but tastes so fresh, like freshly purÃ©ed peppers. I had the 1/2 rotisserie chicken and the meat fell off the bone. Great flavor that went well with the generous portions of beans and rice. We got the flan as a dessert but it was rather overwhelming, a lot heavier and richer than the standard flan, almost cheesecake like. This place has free delivery and also a near BYOB policy! (limit 1 bottle per table)",1
4971,13,4,1/26/2014,"I had the Mofongo which was really good! In other restaurants it is sometimes dry, but here it was pretty moist, and they also give you a side of garlic butter sauce! Also, the staff were all very friendly.",1
4972,13,1,1/17/2014,"Terrible service! Â Casa Adela serves excellent food but the service was downright racist. I'm almost certain we were racially profiled for being WHITE. Â  I am far from that woman who thinks everyone is a racist or out to get me. I was born in east Harlem to a Jewish mother and Puerto Rican father. I brought a friend with me to eat Â some authentic Puerto Rican food. Aside from my abuela, Casa Adela is pretty close to having the best rice and beans in Manhattan. You can imagine how excited I was to introduce my friend to an important part of my culture and heritage. When we sat down I was told by a female waitress that they didn't serve alcohol but I was welcomed to bring my own wine and beer. I went to the bodega on the corner and got a 6 pack of corona. I asked for a bottle opener and we began drinking. After we were served our delicious food, we had another waiter, a male, who kept pushing the check on us. He was very aggressive. It was obvious that he was rushing us out. Although the restaurant was busy, it was not crowded. No one was waiting for a table. After being accosted by our waiter for the 3rd time, my friend paid the check. When we went to open our last beer, we noticed the bottle opener was gone. I got up and asked our waiter for the bottle opener and immediately he said ""YOUR TABLE IS CLOSED."" We kept asking why--again no one was waiting for the table, if that was the case, we would have left without a problem. Â We asked if we could finish our beer and if someone showed up wanting the table, we'd leave without hesitation. Â He immediately said, no. He went on to say that since we paid our bill, the table was officially closed and we couldn't finish our LAST beer. We realized this was why he kept pushing the bill on us--we were drinking alcohol that they weren't making money on, so by rushing us out, they could clean the table and hopefully serve new customers. But again, there weren't any new customers waiting for the table!!! There were many other customers, all Hispanic, who were eating and drinking, taking their time and not once were they pushed to pay their bill or finish their food. The Hispanic couple next to us even said it was strange how we were being targeted. I'm almost certain that if I spoke Spanish or looked a certain way, perhaps more Hispanic, we wouldn't have been treated so poorly. It's 2013 and I live in NYC! I thought we were way past this kind of behavior. When I called this morning to speak with Adela and/or Adela's son, who I know to be very nice, our waiter answered. He wouldn't let me speak with anyone and immediately hung up on me. Â  Yes, the food is great. Walking into Casa Adela reminds me of being in my abuela's kitchen. However, the way my friend and I were treated, I will never go back. I strongly encourage anyone who eats here to ask about their alcohol policy BEFORE you sit down eat. Sadly I will never return to Casa Adela.",1
4973,13,5,12/27/2013,We ate lunch at a great Puerto Rican Spot called Casa Adela's. Â The wife had Pernil Asado and I had Chicken Guisado. We also had Maduros and I tried a drink called Morir Sonando which reminded me of the Orange Cream Cooler I had at Olga's a couple days earlier. Everything was absolutely excellent and we both agreed that it was one of the best meals that we had on our two week East Coast Trip.,1
4974,13,4,12/26/2013,The best Boruiqua food in NYC. Only complaint is the service can be slow at times but I guess in a weird way it adds to the Old School charm of this spot. The Sancocho is unreal. I grew up eating PR food and this takes me home! My favorite cheap eats in the East Village.,1
4975,13,1,11/10/2013,"Just got back to South Jersey from visiting a relative in NYC. We decided to eat at Casa Adela for dinner. We have been there once before. The mofongo was good but it was not what I had ordered. I ordered a plain mofongo with extra garlic and I receive a mofongo with pernil. I let that go, they made a little mistake. I'll pay the extra money for the pernil. Â  I asked at the beginning if they had white rice with beans, and I was told that they only had arroz con gandules. So I said ""no thank you"", and just went with the mofongo. Â Later, as I'm eating my meal the waitress brings white rice and beans. Â ""Ok I'll take the rice and beans home"", I said to myself, even though I no longer wanted the rice and beans. When we get the check, the waitress had charged us $12 extra. I had her add the check and she came up with the wrong number herself, but continued to say that she was right. Since we had six people in our group, we were charged 18% tip which it was fine, but she charge us 18% plus and extra $12. Â The owner's son came to the register and gave me my money, but they were making me feel like I was in the wrong. I even had someone else add it up, and they were wrong. Â Last time I was there, the owner, Adela was cooking in the kitchen, and the service was much better. Maybe her presence makes a big difference in the service. I will never go there again. The customer service was horrible. If you go there, make sure that your food order and your bill is correct.",1
4976,13,2,11/2/2013,"My wife is Puerto Rican so I wanted to check out a different place while we were in the City (Jersey folks). Â First off, the neighborhood was sketchy, Wife is from Jersey City so its not like we don't know the ""inner city element"" ,not that bad, but not the greatest if you have to park 2-3 blocks away from the place. We decided to grab & go. Mofongo was ""15 minute wait. No big deal. We waited, talked etc.That 15 min. turns out to be closer to 30 min. (this is after wife goes into the restaurant to eye ball the workers.) Now the good part, Â we Â get our order & we drive to mid-town to meet some people. This is were we notice that the Pernil that we also ordered wasn't even in the bag. Are You kidding me? $18 bucks for 2/3 of a meal. Oh Well, I guess you have to check your Â food & do their job for them. Place wasn't that busy. I didn't even eat any of the food Â to rate it. Wife said it was good/authentic. Whatever. Word to the wise, check your order.",1
4977,13,3,10/27/2013,The place was a little hard to find because it's not near any subway station. Â The food there was incredible though. Â I was filled up and I was satisfied with my meal. Â The reason why it gets three stars is because of its terrible service. Â It had a homely feel but not necessary in a good way. Â The waitresses were arguing in Spanish on who had to take our table. Â The food took so long to arrive and my mom never got her meal. Â There wasn't a lot of room to sit so were were a little bunched in. Â I think think this is a great place to eat if you just want to take out but not if you want to sit down.,1
4978,13,5,10/16/2013,"Amazing chicken, everything tastes like it was slow cooked in my Abuela's kitchen. So happy to still find some authentic Puerto Rican flavors in LES; gentrification hasn't managed to destroy everything!",1
4979,13,4,10/16/2013,Very enjoyable dinner in a comfortable setting. The sancocho was delicious. My wife loved how they prepared the yuca. Salad was nothing special. Platanos were great.,1
4980,13,4,10/4/2013,"I've walked past this place loads of times since it is right around the corner from my son's school. I was hungry, had some time before I needed to pick him up so decided to go in. I am not Spanish, but love Spanish Caribbean food. For the most part, I've only had homemade Dominican and Cuban food. However, I enjoy trying different cuisines and this place looked really tasty. Even though it was hot out, I ordered the sancocho (I could eat soup every day) and tostones. The soup was good laden with various root vegetables and meat. I wish there was a little more pumpkin and cassava, but that is my preference. The broth, too, was good, but could have been richer and heated up a little more for my liking. The standouts were the tostones. After the waitress brought them to the table, she asked if I'd like some garlic to accompany them. Being a garlic fiend, I, of course, said yes. Oh my gosh. The combination of freshly made right off the stove tostones, so crisp and perfectly fried and salted, with the crushed garlic in oil dip, was amazing. If it was socially acceptable to lick the container the garlic came in, I would have. Be warned though, eating a whole container of garlic will lead to dragon fire breath. When I picked up my son from school I was praying that I would not run into any parents who wanted to chit chat. The meal was extremely filling yet I somehow managed to demolish everything. I cannot wait to go back and try the other dishes. As for service and ambiance, they are fine. The waitress who took my order was helpful answering my questions and checking in to see if I needed anything, but not overly friendly. The inside is cute, on the small side, not fancy, but comfortable. Initially I was the only one there (went on a weekday 2pm ish). Within about 15 minutes 3 other tables got filled. I imagine it'd get packed pretty quickly on the weekend. This seems like a great, authentic local place. I liked that when I paid the lady at the register spoke to me in Spanish even though I am clearly not Spanish.",1
4981,13,2,9/30/2013,"Few of us passed by this cute place which looks authentic. We decided to go in and tried it. The food was good but portion is small comparing to other PR food in NYC, specially beans which served in small tea cup. Â The service is terrible. Our waiter is rude when severing our food and taking our orders. Maybe PR people gets better service. We definitely will not go back or recommend it to others.",1
1844,13,4,9/24/2013,"I don't have a Puerto Rican grandmother. My grandmother is old school Chinese and whenever she has us over for dinner, the small wooden dinner table we sit around is always at risk of imminent collapse from the weight of all the dishes that come out of the kitchen. We gorge ourselves on her ancestral cooking like the filial descendents that we are, and then, to put insult on top of gastronomic injury, we binge on blue bell ice cream and seasonal fruits afterwards. When everyone is satisfied and teetering on the edge of a clinical coma, we drive home, faculties clearly impaired from hyperglycemia, vision handicapped by the tower of tupperware sitting on our laps, the delicious smell of fresh leftovers wafting below our noses, enticing us to steal just another bite. If you know what this feels like, you know what it's like to eat at Casa Adela. This is a no frills kitchen where food comes first. There are no locally-sourced 100% grass fed beefsteaks here, nor are there any self-righteous, aesthetically ironic hipsters to serve them to you. This is old school Puerto Rican eats at old school Puerto Rican prices. Pernil, Cubano sandiwches, rice and beans. When I go out to eat at restaurants, I feel the clear distinction between patron and staff. I feel the need to be served, to be pleased, to be entertained. When I eat here, I feel the need to help clear the table afterwards and make everyone some coffee. That's the kind of place this is, and that's nothing bad.",1
4982,13,5,9/9/2013,"Came here on a Saturday evening around 6pm. Was excited to try the rotisserie chicken and mofongo since everyone gave it such good reviews. However, they said the chicken wasn't ready and that i would have to wait an hour! Decided to wait anyway. This is the 1st time having mofongo, so i have nothing to compare it against but it was damn good. Tons of flavor. I got the side of the roast pork which was also full of flavor. The chicken steals the show. Probably some of the best rotisserie chicken i've had anywhere. Completely juicy and loaded with flavor. The first bite almost knocked me out. Comes with a side of rice and beans and the 1/2 chicken is huge. $9.00 for it. Mofongo was $7, but totaled me $13 with the roast pork. Portions are huge, prices are great, and it's BYOB. Will definitely be coming back again and again.",1
4983,13,5,9/8/2013,Best Puerto Rican food in the city!,1
4984,13,5,8/4/2013,"The food here is like eating at your grandmother's kitchen counter. Authentic, generous and jam packed with love and flavor. The mofongo is especially excellent with the chicharrones. Also the BYOB option is excellent! THANKS for an amazing meal!",1
4985,13,5,7/20/2013,"This place is the shiiiiiiiit. Been coming here for a few years, best meal in the neighborhood for under 20 bucks hands down!",1

4987,13,1,6/27/2013,"regular stuff, nothing to cry about i paid $40 for terrible service (the food was brought out when i asked for it and in the incorrect order) and i couldve made this at home in 5 minus. terrible alcapurrias. this is new yorican food not real puerto rican food ... waste of time try YUCA just around the corner ... so much more flavor and excellent service.",1
4988,13,5,6/24/2013,"The most satisfying dinner of the past few months. Â Pull out $20 from the ATM, grab a buddy and a sixer of Modelo from the bodego next door, then pop in for some mofongo. Â You're gonna want to use the extra $4 for a tip, if only to say it was the best 20 bucks you ever spent. Sure, the food didn't make me cream my jeans, but it did help me overcome my fear of mofongo, perhaps the least dignified of national delicacies -- Â a sticky, starchy lump of plantains and fried pork chunks that is usually so dry it takes a whole pitcher of gravy to allow a fork to pass through it. Â Casa Adela's was perfectly moist and came with an awesome garlic butter sauce, full of all sorts of spices -- I got monfongo'd. The biggest sell, though, is the atmosphere -- it's an authentic neighborhood dirty spoon, the cooks standing at the counter drinking beer and cracking jokes between orders. Â English is a second language here, which is fine because I love going to restaurants where I can practice my Spanish and not feel like a prick. Â BYOB, pay at the register, and hairnets is my gold standard from now on, assuming there's also some rice and beans floating around the room.",1
4989,13,2,6/24/2013,"They ran out of rice, and the food was alright. People who give it 5 stars obviously don't know good food. The service was horrific, and that's an understatement.",1
4990,13,5,6/8/2013,This is a real Puerto Rican family Resturante and with the best food made by Adela for more than 30 years in Loisaida! Amazing!,1
3065,13,5,5/12/2013,Mofongo. Â Just.... mofongo. Â The pollo. Â The everything. Â Everything is delicious. Â I love that I feel like I'm walking into a Puerto Rican kitchen and you have aunties in the back cooking for you. Â It's a hole in the wall and I LOVE that. Â Good food. Â Good prices.,1
4991,13,4,4/11/2013,"You can't go wrong with latin rotisserie chicken and yellow rice & beans. Â  I do prefer the chicken at Pio Pio and Pio Pio Rico, but the chicken at Casa Adela is MUCH, MUCH better than other latin spots in the neighborhood Â I've got to go back and try the mofongo.",1

3762,13,3,3/3/2013,The prices on some of their items was outdated. Also charged me extra because I was taking out. The mofongo is good here. Not the best neighborhood.,1

Â If you're polite about it, and offer to share, the friendly staff will even let you bring a bottle of booze to compliment your feast, if you please. Â I always leave satisfied, and extremely happy!!!",1
3324,13,4,2/10/2013,"When first came into this little restaurant the place was half full, it wasn't until I was waiting for my food that I realized that I was the only customer there, they all worked there or were friends hanging out. I think that's pretty much the laid back Puerto Rican culture and I'm perfectly ok with that. I thought it was endearing that a couple old ladies were sitting one of the tables peeling garlic spending time with each other. I think that kind of love of culture translates to the food here. I've only been here once but I was so happy with my mofongo (about $8) that I'll definitely be back. Most of the meals here are $7-13 so it's definitely an affordable place to make return trips. It's not a fancy place so don't expect the most attentive service or a romantic atmosphere, just classic latin food done well. Back to that mofongo. It was made 100% by scratch to order and was incredibly flavorful and unlike others I've had, moist. It's listed under apps but no normal person could eat it and still get a full meal afterwards.",1
4996,13,5,2/2/2013,"By far, being born and raised in Lower East Side, I praise this place the way I praise the hood. It's a staple. Â  The chicken here is seasoned so phenomenally, it makes you want to hug your abuela, as if you're dining there, you'll bound to see the old school locals come in and hug and yell at each other lovingly as if you was back in the isla, just kickin' it and eating good food. The mofongo is monstrously delicious, the porkchops are fried and juicy somehow. Nothing here is not worth trying. EXCEPTIONALLLLLLLLLLLLLL..... Except the service which is painfully slow but if you stare at your waitress while she's on the move, you realize it's cuz they run the whole show (food prep and all that good jazz) so with the best Puerto Rican food in NYC, gotta earn that plate and be patient. Brush up on your spanish and you can chat up the owner/abuela (Goddess of Casa Adela) while you wait. Â Oh snap, I almost forgot- Don't front on the chicharron de pollo, shit is sizzling crack, i am super in love with bone in chicharrons and this place got it and makes it with MAGIC. smacks you right in the mouth while you chew. Home is now at Casa Adela.",1
4997,13,5,1/21/2013,"delicious and cheap prices. Â service was a bit slow, but family run and very friendly! i just had the pork chops with yellow rice and black beans... so good.

4998,13,5,1/13/2013,Two words: 1) Phenomenal. 2) Mafongo. Can't wait to go back. Sweetest people.,1
4999,13,4,12/25/2012,It's getting harder to find home style Puerto Rican restaurants in NYC but Casa Adele is going strong. We had the mofongo with pernil and tostones. They really hit the spot. They even had some local folks playing drums and singing traditional songs. I am giving them 4 stars because no one's pernil or rice and beans is as savory as my mother-in-law's. We have found our new regular haunt in the city after the closure of Papasito's in midtown.,1
5000,13,4,12/16/2012,Don't miss it. Â Really authentic Puerto Rican food. Â  The best rotisserie Â chicken I've ever eaten. Perfectly seasoned n moist. Â Worth double the price. Comes with large portion. Of rice and beans. Â Chicarones de pollo was great . Prices can't be beat. Don't pay attention to ambience. Â It's small but clean.,1

5004,13,4,11/24/2012,"I usually come here on my lunch break since it's near the school I student teach at. It's a cute little familiy-owned restaurant that reminds me a lot of the bomb Mexican food places back home in LA. Plus: I get their 1/2 chicken and rice every time. Most often than not, they give me so much that I can't even finish it! Parts of the chicken is dry, but the juicier, tender parts are to die for. The white rice tastes like it was cooked with chicken broth, which adds an additional savory flavor to it. I come here so often, the waitresses have memorized my order! The wait for your food is typically not that long. Their black beans are so good and I don't even really like beans all that much! Delta: Sometimes, seating is hard to come by. Luckily, during lunch time, I can usually grab a seat and eat a quick meal. The arrangement of the seating is kind of weird, and when you're closer to the door, the draft gives you a chill whenever it opens. Ratings Service - 1 Food - 1 Environment - 0.5 Price - 0.5 Experience - 1 Overall = 4",1
5005,13,5,11/19/2012,"Very cheap, very delicious, authentic, and friendly. I am not sure what else you need... If you like food from this region of the world then you will like Casa Adela. For a more detailed review, read the review directly below this one. Couldn't agree with it more.",1
5006,13,5,10/24/2012,Super authentic and good. I can imagine this is how it feels to be in PR at some local joint.,1
5007,13,4,9/22/2012,I could eat an entire meal of just the yellow rice and red beans. Rotisserie chicken and steak with onions are both excellent,1
5008,13,5,9/7/2012,"After finally moving into the neighborhood, I decided to make Casa Adela my first spot to try with the family. My dad is puertorican so I didn't want him to be disappointed so I'm so glad that it was amazing! We came around 6 on Labor Day and it was packed so had to wait a few minutes for a table for 5. There's probably 5 or 6 tables so it shouldn't be too bad of a wait if you just walk in. The menu was pretty straightforward for those familiar with the cuisine, but unfortunately they were running low on a lot of the items. Â To start, we ordered alcapurrias, ensalada de pulpo (octopus salad -- SO delicious, will definitely reorder), and chicharron de pollo (fried chicken -- warning that the appetizer size is a LARGE plate). The appetizers were pretty filling so didn't leave too much room for the entrees. Orders around the table included 3 of the pernil asado (they were running low so I think our portion sizes may have been smaller than normal), 1/2 pollo, and the chicharron de pollo entree. Everything came with rice and beans. Sadly they were out of the yellow rice, but whatever, I was hungry and white rice would have to do. You also get a choice of red or black beans. Make sure to get the cafe con leche. So delicious. The flan wasn't ready though so we couldn't get any. Guess just a reason to come back! I'm giving Adela 5 stars in hopes that the next time I go they have everything and it's just as delicious as I imagine.",1
5009,13,4,8/18/2012,"For the past few years, my life mission has been to find authentic Puertorrican food. I was born and raised in PR, and moved to the States 4 years ago. Call me sentimental... but my body craves this food. I found Casa Adela after an Internet search. It's close enough to my place, so I decided to give it a try. -Food: Spot on. Adela herself was there in the kitchen. We had Rotisserie chicken (juicy and delicious) with tostones. Surprisingly, they had ""Mayo-Ketchup""... My fellow Island Puertorricans surely understand. Also, had mofongo. I've had better mofongo, but this was good. It's consistency was more like Dominican mangÃº, rather than mofongo (which I can understand given that this place is more of a fusion of both cuisines). White rice and red beans were delicious. -Service: This is where it's lacking. I called, and asked for take out. They said they usually don't provide this service, but they would make an exception for me (was it because I was ordering in Spanish? Not sure.) This took me by surprise, as both Yelp and Menupages state that they DO have take out. Anywhooo.... They took my order (which included Octopus salad) and phone number. They said it would take 15 min. Got there about 20 min later. Food was not ready, and to my surprise (again), no octopus. Should they have called or let me know before? I ordered an avocado salad instead, which was just that... lettuce with an avocado on top. After an additional 15 min wait, my food was ready (although I almost left without tostones if I hadn't checked the containers). They guy that took my order, made up for all of this by telling me to ask for him if I ever want take out again. -Overall: Puertorrican food rules, and this place delivers (not literally apparently). Would come back, but only with patience on my side.",1
2875,13,5,8/15/2012,"Born and raised Puerto Rican, I didn't move to the states till I was 18. It is always difficult to find an authentic Puerto Rican restaurant, not Dominican or Cuban, but Puerto Rican. And Casa Adela is just that! They have anything you could want from a Puerto Rican restaurant: alcapurrias, arroz con gandulez, mofongo con caldo, sancocho, and so much more. EVERYTHING on the menu is delicious and home made. For Thanksgiving we brought in our Turkey and they seasoned it the Puerto Rican way and we brought it back home and baked it in our apt... and it was delicious as well!!! It is cash only, really cheap, BYOB perfection....",1
5010,13,4,8/5/2012,"When I first walked in I thought it was going to be the same old over-seasoned Puerto Rican food that you would get at the local Cuchifrito. To my surprise, the food was excellent. I went there with a few guys from work and all had good things to say about the food. The wait is a little longer than your average PR or Dominican restaurant but well worth it. Everything is fresh and seasoned perfectly. The staff is friendly and the LES history covers its walls. The seating is limited and the place kind of tight. They only accept cash, but who cares? The food is great.",1
5011,13,5,7/24/2012,"Well, Well, Well....Authentic Rican food is something to be very proud of. Â This place is small and unassuming until you taste the food and you realize that it is FINE dining! Â CASH ONLY. Â Laundrymat across the street dispenses cash upon inserting debit card =) Small tables become quaint tables. Â Cluttered spaces become an eclectic and island style. Â  They are smart, they hand you two small plastic cups for the carafe of water they leave with you. Â There is a pretty decent size menu with meat, chicken and fish available. Â I chose the bacala with a tomato sauce and bay leaves, Â Yuka (casava) Â and onions, bacala and yellow rice con gandules (pigeon peas). Â Hubbie ordered their soup with root vegetables. The soup was ok. Â I know someone who makes a mean Honduran soup so I compare everything to that. Â AND my mother makes an awesome soup too. Â So the soup was OK. The bacala was awesome with the rice, beans and yuka. Â The bacala came with the rice and beans and the yuka was a side order. Â More than enough carbs to keep me going until our late night stop at Hot Pot Buffet in Boston at 11pm. Totally great place, will be back just to try other items on the menu. Â  They have pasteles available for purchase by the 1/2 dozen. Â Awesome.",1
5012,13,5,7/13/2012,The best Mofonggo!! Made fresh everytime you order. No wonder it has won so many awards. Mofonggo and roast pork (Pernil) is a perfect combintation. The pork chops and yellow rice with red beans were also great. Even the Cafe con Leche was perfect. To top it all is friendly service. Everyone is ready for a chat and will constantly check to see if you need anything. Priced well. Worth every penny.,1
5013,13,4,7/3/2012,"I typically, usually, who am I kidding, always get the 1/2 pollo with yellow rice and red beans. I stop by for dinner from time to time - just for take out - and they package everything so nicely. Definitely recommended - the best Spanish food I've had! I'm not sure if the rating changes but during the daytime it's a C but it changes to A at night? Odd.",1
5014,13,4,6/16/2012,"Casa Adela is one of the better Spanish restaurants the city has to offer. It's a much cheaper alternative to heavy hitters Don Coqui, Sofrito and Sazon. It's just as good as those three as well. I've never been disappointed after eating a meal here. I've eaten the pork chops, roast pork, fried chicken, chicken stew, roast chicken and octopus salad from Casa Adela. All of those dishes are delicious! The octopus salad is wonderful! If you are a fan of such dishes, it's a must try. The food here is made from the heart. It's similar to the yummy home cooked meal that only certain Puerto Rican abuelas can make. This place does not have many seats and the restaurant tends to fill up fast,especially in the evening. Come early if you want to dine in. The restaurant was also featured and profiled on the Food Network by Aaron Sanchez. If you are in the lower east side and want some good affordable Spanish food, go visit Casa Adela.",1
5015,13,4,5/28/2012,"The food was slamming!!!! Unfortunately, it doesnt get 5 stars because of the tight seating space. My friend and I came here during the Memorial weekend Â just hanging out in the city. Its a small restaurant with very few tables. When we arrived there was a large party already sitting and took up most of the space in the restauant. After reading the rave reviews on Yelp about their rotisisserie chicken, I had to order them. I also had some rice and peas and my friend and I also had the audacity to order the Monfongo. Uhm, Uhm, Uhm, it was alll soooo delicious. The chicken was juicy, tender and just hit the spot. The rice and peas were cooked well and very tasty. I really didnt have enough room to eat the monfongo we ordered but after eating a few pieces I couldnt stop. All I have to say is wow, I am very impressed especially with their affordable prices. I was able to take food home and it was just as good the next day for lunch. I will definitely return to the lil spot and taste some other items on the menu.",1
5016,13,5,5/12/2012,"Basically, I love this place. I want to bottle the delicious rotisserie chicken smell coming from their kitchen and scent my whole life with it. I want to serve their chicken at my wedding, and make everyone eat it at my funeral. That's how good it is. In all reality, their rotisserie chicken is awesome, but their Mofongo is pretty much equally amazing. Delicious lump of plantains and garlic and roast pork. Their flan is also pretty amazing. I am making myself hungry just writing about it.",1
5017,13,5,5/6/2012,"Now I can't comment on the interior or the service as I've never sat down and ate inside and my friend picked up the takeout order, but the rotisserie chicken was really outstanding. Â We spiced it up a bit with some Yucateco habanero sauce (as is our wont) but it's bursting with flavor even without using your condiments at home. Â Rice and beans were pretty much perfect. Â I'd love to try some tostones or mofongo for a more PR meal as I'm sure they must do them right but cot damn this was some delicious chicken. Â  And here's an idea for people whining about the service or the this or the that. Â Get your food takeout and you can go be miserable by yourself in your apartment without having to deal with other people and then coming to some website to have a whine about it. Â When you come to a small place like this, you come for the authentic cuisine not for somebody to put a napkin on your lap for you.",1
5018,13,5,5/4/2012,"Sweet baby jeebus why did I wait so long to come here! My first real experience with Puerto Rican food was here and it was glorious! I went with a friend on a Saturday night around 8 and we were seated right away. Though, while we were there a lot of parties had to wait as the place is very small. We ordered some tostones, mofongo with pork, and 1/2 rotisserie. I was in heaven! The mofongo was especially my favorite. I loved the family environment and our server came by several times to ask if we were good and to ask specifically how we liked the food. It's also BYOB, but don't get crazy. My buddy and I bought two big beers and shared that..but I'd avoid bringing a 6 pack since....well we were told they frown upon that. Also, the price is PERFECT! See you in Alphabet City!",1
5019,13,4,4/25/2012,"Wow. This place is something to rave about. A teeny tiny mom & pop restaurant with maybe 5-6 tables... the service is really above par, where they're super friendly, welcoming and helpful. The food took a little while, but it was worth the wait. 4 tiny girls had a table full of appetizers, our own dishes and sides. The mofongo tasted different than in PR but I enjoyed all of it (w/ pernil) and kept saying it was delicious everytime I grabbed for more. Tostones were cooked perfectly where the outside was crispy and the inside was plantainlicious. I had the breaded chicken which was simple but amazingly crispy and light. It's also BYOB, but like other reviews say, they only allow one bottle of wine at a time... they were going to charge $9 to open our second one but that could be because we were close to closing time and they didn't want us to linger. Friend forgot her phone on the table and they ran after us too. Really friendly staff with food to die for (and extremely affordable)",1
5020,13,4,4/4/2012,"The food is tasty, fresh and very authentic. Growing up Puerto Rican, I have an affinity for this type of food and I can be pretty critical if not done right, but no worries here. The staff is friendly, service is quick and attentive the only drawback is that it's tight quarters, but I guess some would say its intimate. Try the fried chicken chunks. And I can still taste the garlic a day later when you have the tostones.",1
5021,13,4,3/12/2012,"I came here by the recommendation of my friend's mom who is a lovely Puerto Rican lady who cooks wonderful food.Very highly recommended!! This was the first time I tried PR food. I went with a couple of friends and they tried the pork and chicken.I had a bite of that Â (not eating that kind of meat these days, but oh, I want to try sometimes new flavors) and it was delicious! But trying to be a good pesciterian, I ordered rice, beans and papaya juice. Well...it was super good!! I am getting use to be disappointed with vegetarian side dishes but this was great meal, super tasty. I ordered the papaya juice without milk though, just as I am used to drink it. The portions are gigantic, so beware, I recommend to share. The place is tiny too, and there are no reservations so allow some time to wait for a table. Totally worthy though!",1
5022,13,4,3/3/2012,"The food was excellent, service--could be better. Though it's BYOB, we were only permitted to open one bottle of wine (to share between 6 people) because they didn't want us to stay long (their words). I respect that, since it is a small place and six is a HUGE group in a tiny spot, but it was like they couldn't wait to get rid of us. I think they were actually a little disappointed when we ordered dessert. Try going with a small group on a weekday and try the mufungo.",1
5023,13,3,2/12/2012,"I liked this place overall, but its more of like a lunch spot than a dinner place. Â The food I had was good and I was told the pulled pork was excellent.

5026,13,5,1/9/2012,"If you want some good Puerto Rican food, I would try Casa Adela. The place doesn't look like much - it's really a hole in the wall kind of place. Not much room, so if it's busy you'll be lucky if you find a seat, but the wait would be worth it. Everything in this restaurant is delicious. The roasted chicken is so moist. The maduros are nice and sweet. The tostones are warm and crunchy. The rice, beans, yuca, pork...everything is good. Bring your own beer or wine to wash everything down. The best part of it all is the bill! This place is so affordable. You will eat like a king and pay something like $20. It's true. This place is amazing. Check it out!",1

Â We ordered the mofongo and originally wanted to order the rotisserie chicken as well, but they were out. Â Instead, they suggested fried chicken, which we were wary about b/c it's just hard to do right. The mofongo w/ pernil was amazing. Â If you don't like garlic, don't get it. Â If you do, you'll love it. Â The fried chicken, however, was the real surprise. It was perfectly seasoned and fried in a way where it was still very moist and didn't taste dried out at all. We went to PR a week after this meal, had mofongo 3 times and it came close to this place twice, but even w/ sunshine and 80 degree weather, I was still wishing I had the mofongo at Casa Adela. Â The one time we tried to get fried chicken, it was nowhere close...",1
5029,13,5,12/30/2011,"Since there's no good Puerto Rican food in Boston, I save my appetite for my trips to New York. I've been to La Taza de Oro and it's quite alright, but this place was everything I wanted. $4 bought me a pretty big salad with tons of avocado, and for $8.50 I got the best pernil (roast pork shoulder) I've had in a while with some rice and beans. The service was friendly enough, not over-the-top friendly but I could always get one of the old ladies to bring me what I needed. This place is small and casual and they're blasting trashy Univision on the TV and I'm not rushed out the door, so it works well for me! I will be recommending to all my fellow Puerto Rican friends. Oh, and grab a coffee on your way out-- I'm not a big coffee drinker but theirs was just like I remember back home.",1

I tried the steak w/ onions instead, and it was not good. It didn't look appetizing at all, and the onions tasted funny; the meat itself wasn't terrible, but definitely not great. I ended up eating some of someone else's chicken. The rice and black beans are fine, and the sweet plantains were good.",1

The prices are great, but I get carried away everytime I go, so I end up spending more than most would. They treated my friends and I like family! (Coo' tip: BYOB...just don't get carried away!)",1
5032,13,4,9/10/2011,"Straight to it. The Pork Chops here are on a Point! I've learned to avoid Pork Chops at Latin restaurants 'cause nine times out ten it's going to be a bland piece of pig that's been sitting under a heat lamp for 12 hours prior to it hitting your plate. Â Casa Dela, The total Opposite! Two Banging Ass, Muy Moist Chops of a Flavorful Pig served up with yellow rice and red beans. Tore it up, Tore it Up, Tore it Up. No Fat. Not Charred. Not Dry. Just perfectly cooked pig. I wana give the place five stars but they hit some bumps before the pig made it to the plate. The place is pretty small so we had to wait due to all the tables being full. Â Another couple walked in right behind us and had to wait as well. So you got four customers patiently waiting to be seated for 15 minutes. After contemplating leaving the place a patron that was sipping coffee and surfing the web walks behind the counter, sticks money in register and then moves his laptop to smaller non-customer table. My company and I just looked at each like these people have to be crazy. Â No Bueno! Maybe it's just me, but don't waiting, paying customers take precedence in that situation? or any similar situation? Big frown on our faces as we were seated at the table that web surfing staff guy got up from... My friend tried to order the Rotisserie Chicken and Sweet Plantains, which they had none of. So that didn't go over to well with us after the wait. I think that's enough reason to subtract one star, right? Â So we both ended up with the Pork Chops!! When the food came out we forgot about all of no bueno stuff Â and the remaining staff was warm and friendly. Enjoyed the meal by far. Will most certainly be back. Fa Sure. if you like a pork chop, bookmark the place.",1

Their chicken, I swear it's cooked to perfection, I've never had chicken that tasted sooooo good, I'm not exaggerating, I'm being honest. Go try it, you'll say the same thing, I promise. It's so good that I had to update my ""Favorite Restaurants"" list and I had to knock out Sofrito from being number 1, yahuh, it's that good. Plus the icing on the cake? it's a whole lot cheaper than Sofrito...duhhhh! The service? It's awesome but I guess it's because his Uncle knows the whole staff including the owner, they're all sweethearts, I love it.",1

Â The workers all situate themselves out in the dining area - chattering. Â It's fine by me as long as my food doesn't take 20 minutes to make. Â AND it was just a Cubano. Â AND it barely looked like it had anything in there. Â SMH. Â Luck for them I guess, I have a ""small"" stomach. Â  My boyfriend's food came after mine and it was just a plate of cut out pernil as supposed to stredded, a plate of spanish rice and a cup of red beans. Â It was good but not as fulfilling as he wanted it to be either and not as he remembered it used to be. Food is cheap and good but not to the point where I'd recommend going if you have an appetite.

I've been here twice now and am returning again. Â I've had the pernil and roast chicken which was really tasty, the pork is well cooked and the sauce it's cooked in adds great flavor; it mixes well if you top it over your rice and beans (if you take it to go). Â Also have had the chicken stew, which is just as amazing as the pernil. The wait is long, even for take out, but expect that to be a compliment as they actually cook your food. Â The wait staff is extremely friendly and patient and are more than willing to strike a conversation with you. Â  Expect to pay just under $10 a person, without tip. Â They have a sign posted that says ""Let's just pretend I'm in business to make money"" which is a solid indicator they don't take credit, so bring cash! In my latest experience, we didn't get the correct order for take-out (they forgot to give us our pernil) but we came back the next day and they gave us a complimentary pernil to make up for their mistake...

Tucked away on a quiet street where hipsters have not been spotted, is this unassuming little shop that houses some of the best, authentic Puerto Rican dishes you'll find in Manhattan. This place is unassuming and noticeably homey. From the checkered plastic table linen to Telemundo blasting on a TV, this place offers up comfort and good food at a great price. It was a dark and cold evening and we decided to meet here for a week night dinner. Now, the Puerto Rican (Boriquen) dish to order is pernil asado (roasted pork). Cooked to perfection with flavors slowly steeped into the pork, one can't help but feel paradise with every bite. The meal also came with salad and tostones (fried green plaintain). This dish could easily feed two HUNGRY people. And although it has been awhile since we came here, what sticks out in my mind, is the cheap prices, the high quality pernil, and the wonderful store owner who poured extra-virgin olive oil into our dishes with love and care. There is nothing like a good meal with good company and friendly waitstaff. I will be back to try the guisado (beef stew) and to have some mofongo (mashed plaintain). Le Amo Puerto Rico!",1

Thanks to the previous review of Thomas D, I kidnapped my cousin who lives in Brooklyn and I finally had the opportunity to dine at this Awesome joint! I ordered everything that Thomas D suggested along with some Rotisserie chicken...just one word..WOOOOWWWW!!!! The neighbor is a little sketchy, but the food is soo worth it. Thomas D mentioned that it's BYOB, well you don't have to ask me twice. Â I showed up with a bottle of Pinot Grigio and we were quickly serviced by Miguel Â who immediately opened our bottle and served it to us in glasses. Let me tell you; he was awesome. He suggested some other foods and actually suggested another wine called Albarino. I quickly ran accross the street to this wine shop and got us a bottle. The wine was Awesome...I just couldn't believe how amazing the Food, Service, and atmosphere was. I will definately be going back to Casa Adela, every chance I get.

I came here for lunch today and the chicken was just ""meh"" - it doesn't even begin to compare to Pio Pio. I had the mofongo which was a new experience for me, and I wasn't blown away. It was moist, but not terribly flavorful until I doused it in hot sauce. The prices are relatively cheap and you get a big portion, but they tried to charge me .50 more per item than was posted on the menu. I told them about it thinking it was an innocent mistake and the waitress got pretty pissed off, saying they had to raise prices. That's fine, but if you raise prices you have to update your menu. I kind of felt like they were taking advantage of me because of the way I look/dress, although I don't want to believe that's really the case. They finally took the extra charges off. Overall, lunch including a begrudgingly-given tip was $12.",1

Â Bring the dinero for dinner, because cards are not taken. Â Also, Casa Adela is BYOB, but that's a plus rather than a minus. Â Always cheaper to buy and bring your own anyway. Â  Another note: Â the establishment is rather small. Â Not many tables (maybe 6 or 7) so get here at a decent hour to avoid the inevitable overcrowding. Â We went on a Sunday night around 6-ish, and there was plenty of room. Â  We had the Tostones, Mofongo, Pernil, Bacalao, Chicharrones de Pollo, and Arroz con Habichuelas. Â All of them were excellent!! Â Top notch flavors, good portion sizes...not a thing at all to complain about. Â Seriously: Â the food tasted GREAT! Â  Adela's son was present in the restaurant while we were there. Â He told us Adela had recently been on the Food Network because Aaron Sanchez had said her Pernil was the best he'd had in NY! Â Turns out Adela was in PR at the time, but the food was in very capable hands. Â  Service was quick, friendly, and it helped having a wife order in the native tongue! Â  We will most certainly be back when we can find the time. Â We drove 2 hrs. to eat here and stop at Ferrara's in Little Italy before returning home and we were NOT disappointed.

Â If there is a criticism, and this is minor, it's that some menu items are frequently not available. Â The staff do, however, always remind me to call in advance if you want something specific.

The staff here is very friendly. The place is a bit small (there are about 6 tables), so it can get crowded. The food here is just like home cooking. The roast chicken here is very good. I have also had the chuletas fritas here (fried pork chops) and those were amazingly juicy and tender as well. You can order entrees here with rice and beans, or with salad and plantains.

Rice and beans are like you would get in abuela's kitchen. The chuletas cause a serious mouth-gasm. The cafe is delightfully strong but delicious. I wish all coffee in NYC was as good.

I normally order the half a chicken with yellow rice & black beans, but as of late I've been trying other dishes. I recently had the bacalou (dried cod cooked with veggies in a tomato sauce), the roast pork & the chicken stew. All good dishes, but the chicken is still my favorite. It has a deep red, flavorful skin (I'd really like to know how they spice this dish) & succulent, moist flesh. I've tried to replicate it at home & just cannot get anywhere as close. With the weather being this cold, you might also want to try out the Sacocho, an awesome soup with loads of root vegetables & a chunk of oxtail. Â Guaranteed to warm you up!

Â  While very charming, this little eatery is not for the fickle. We waited a while, a long while to get attention from the waitstaff. But it is a tiny neighborhood staple, with its own nuances and we weren't prepared for it. Once it became apparent that the we weren't being served - the staff took extra care to be attentive to us. The food was good. We ate the mofongo - a mashed plantain/pork/garlic staple of the Caribbean. The garlic in the mofongo was very potent. I find mofongo can sometimes be a bit to dry, that was not the case here. The san cocho here was also nice, as good as a restaurants interpretation of the hearty stew can get. The rotisserie chicken was delicious, well seasoned and slow cooked to fatty perfection. The tostones were nice but a bit softer than I prefer.

5074,13,5,3/27/2009,"i'm Puerto Rican and this place reminded me of when i would be dragged by my parents to a relative whom i've never met's house, left to sit on the plastic-covered couch watching fuzzy tv, deathly afraid to change the channel, only to have that interrupted by my mother yelling ""Gaby, quieres comer""...the portions aren't insanely big but the taste makes up for it, the pernil and mofongo are among the best i've had and so is the roast chicken, it can be hit or miss but so was my mother's cooking so i don't hold it against the chef, this is after all a mother's kitchen just open to the public",1
5075,13,5,3/19/2009,"One of my favorite places in the entire city. Insanely huge portions for the money and the half-a-chicken is perfection itself. The wine is good, the water is freezing cold and the tostones are my favorite appetizer. There's a huge fridge of Goya juices (just like you used to drink as a kid!) and sodas. Everything is delicious because it's homemade. Highly recommended.",1
5076,13,4,12/16/2008,I came here to use the bathroom. This place has a lot of heart though. There seemed to be a whole puerto rican family here. I got some sort of strange chicken dish. It was good except for the red beans. I was served food by like a ninety year old grandmother. Got to love it. I felt like part of the family. Note: There were a bunch of copies of the financial times here for the customers. This was pretty heavy reading lol.,1
5077,13,4,10/6/2007,"Casa Adela has great, authentic, inexpensive Puerto Rican food. After a show at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, I took my friend who is originally from Puerto Rico (she's a finicky former model and is generally found at Ciprani in 4 inch heels making the scene). She absolutely loved it - both the food and the atmosphere. Try the beef stew. It is the ultimate comfort food. The beef is cooked to perfection. I live a few blocks away and I stop by (to eat in or take out) semi-regularly in the winter. The restaurant pulls locals from the neighborhood and just like my neighbors who have lived in the hood forever, they ain't gonna cater to you. And unless they know you, they are not going to be overly friendly...they warm up over time. During the blackout, the owners took action and served up huge plates for 5 bucks a pop. Everyone instantly bonded over the homemade food. Great experience.",1
5078,13,2,8/31/2007,"Neighborhood charm my ass. A small rundown spot with greasy tables and blaring Spanish language TV from the corner. The waitress seemed overwhelmed and unqualified. I love Latino cooking, but the food here is weak. I had the pork chops. Two over cooked under spiced slabs with a side of rice and beans. The rice and beans were really tasteless. In a city that is so rich in Latino cooking Casa Adela is a waste of time.",1
5079,13,4,8/2/2007,"Just moved to the area. Â Super excited. Â Decided to step into Casa Adela to have my first meal in my new neighborhood. Â Had the half chicken with rice & beans, avocado salad, and a batida de papaya. Â Chicken was super juicy and flavorful. Â Black beans were soooooo yummy, cooked perfectly. Â She used the West Indian type of avocado for the salad - I kind of prefer the creamier avocados, but it was still good. Â The batida was so-so... Â it was too ice-creamy for me. Â Overall, it was a good meal - I cleaned my plate! Â Will definitely be back to try her other stuff!",1
5080,13,3,5/13/2006,"This slightly run-down Puerto Rican luncheonette draw in more Puerto Rican locals than East Village hipsters, which can be a refreshing change. On a slow weeknight, you might be the only actually paying customer. A grandmother is sitting in the next table shelling beans and watching telenovelas, a group of old men are flirting with the waitress, someone comes in to pick up her kids who are coloring at the front table. The food is fantastic and the bill will make you wonder if you're in Puerto Rico, not Manhattan. Generous portions means that an order of their fabulous roasted chicken or pork, with rice and beans, and fried plantains is enough to feed two. A word of warning: If you don't finish your plate, or if you don't know your way around PR food, there's a chance you'll get the evil eye from the waitress. Being the recipient of the evil eye enough times where they actually recognize me now, I can tell you that it's definitely not a good thing. At this point, I'm actually kind of scared to go back (thus the three stars). If you go, I hope you either have a Â larger appetite or a steelier nerves.",1
5081,13,3,3/22/2006,"Casa Adela was started by Adela (who still around) back in the early 70s. According to family members, they've seen a lot of change in the neighborhood but they're happy that things have been cleaned up a bit. Adela turns out a crave-worthy cubano sandwich (~$6.75). A stellar and voluminous combination of supple roast pork, ham, swiss, and pickles on a warm and toasty roll. This is a near perfect sandwich. The mofongo (~$5.50) combines mashed plantains, shredded pork, and garlic. While I liked the dish, it needed salt and maybe a squeeze of lime to brighten the flavors. I also tried the pernil asado, or roasted pork, which included a side of rice and beans. I opted for yellow rice and black beans, all three items came on separate plates with a brothy sauce on the side. I mixed everything together, added a few squirts of the table squeezy bottle of hot sauce, and a bit of mofongo. Although the pork was not tough, it was not quite as fatty and luscious as the roast pork on the sandwich. Eating at Adela's felt like I was eating at the Puerto Rican grandmother's house that I never had. Telenovelas on the tv, occasional bursts of song, loud conversation, and sass amongst the ladies running the place, and fellows from the neighborhood dropping in for this and that. The rotisserie chicken looked good too. 3.5 stars overall, but I would give the sandwich 4.5 on its own.",1

Pickled watermelon rind au jus or ambergris foam with morning-glory-infused pumpkin fritters or whatever the heck...can't they just serve a really nice, well-done fried chicken? It always seems to me that places who feel the need to fancify their food are just trying to cover up the fact that they can't cook and hope you won't notice. The angel biscuits are good, but I won't be back.",-1
5084,14,3,10/16/2014,"I mean, it's fine and I had no complaints -- cute spot, nice servers, everything tasted good -- but food this basic should cost a lot less. Every single thing on the menu is overpriced by $5 to $10.",-1
5085,14,3,10/2/2014,"PROS: My wife and I fancy ourselves as fried chicken experts, and Root & Bone's fried chicken is among the best we've ever tasted. Â The way they lace the honey and lemon into the seasoning, so that you taste the lemon as well as the honey in each bite is amazing! Â The macaroni and cheese is pretty good too. Â CONS: The prices are on the high side compared to other chicken and waffle places to which we've been. Â The pecan pie was a little watery for our tastes, and venue is on the small side, so you might consider taking your food ""To go."" Â OVERALL: Â We will definitely be back!",-1
5086,14,3,10/1/2014,"Tried the two piece plus biscuit take-out fried chicken. If you are looking for southern fried chicken, this is not your place. If you want fried chicken with a distinctive Asian flair, this might be for you. The meat is brined so it has that odd, seemingly raw meat texture that brined bird has. It is not raw, just looks that way. Tasty and crisp, but from somewhere other than the south! I miss Mama's.",-1
5087,14,4,7/24/2014,Finding good fried chicken in NYC is difficult. Some of the most highly rated options I've tried were no better than the Publix Supermarket deli chicken (although their chicken is great). The fried chicken here was delicious. They incorporate sweet tea & lemon with a light breading and tender juicy chicken. It makes for a deadly combo. The menu is very inventive with new takes on old southern favorites. We tried a few different items and enjoyed each of them. I also recommend taking a look at the cocktail list. The drinks are well crafted and offer great flavor without being overpowering.,-1
5088,14,5,12/17/2014,"I'm going to get right to it: Root & Bone is as good as it gets. There are so many places to eat in East Village, that it can get overwhelming. But if you're ever in the area, I hope you find some time to get a bucket of bird because it might be the best fried chicken I've ever had. Each time my boyfriend and I go, we order half of a bucket of bird, the mac and cheese, and whatever else we feel like having. The deviled eggs are a MUST! It gets very crowded at times - my boyfriend and I have yet to sit at an actual table. But we'll gladly sit at the counter, knowing that we're about to get a quality meal.",-1
5089,14,5,11/9/2014,One word - WOW! Definitely worth the wait. Sat bar side with friends. Our server/bartender Victoria was the best.

5092,14,5,9/13/2014,"Absolutely scrumptious! I went on the recommendation of my sister and it definitely lived up to expectations. Between the three of us we had some mac and cheese, fried chicken, salad and the meatloaf - all of which tasted as good as the next. Service was perfect and we were sitting up at the chefs table so could see two of the chefs preparing a lot of the meals. They were friendly enough to chat with us and answer questions as well as checking on how our meals were. It was so worth the visit and I'll be sure to recommend to my friends who are coming to nyc!",-1
5093,14,1,1/6/2015,"Terrible service! Â No amount of cute decor or even fluffy biscuits can make up for poor service. Â We got there at 6 pm and were seated right away, which was encouraging since I'd heard it was difficult to get in. Â Started out okay but it was 20 minutes before the server came over to take both our drink and food orders at the same time -- a particular pet peeve. Â Then she proceeded to take the orders for two other parties, collecting them as she went along but not submitting any until she had done practically the whole room. Â That was the last we saw of her. Â The food eventually got delivered -- lukewarm (why? Â I have an idea it was sitting on the counter waiting for someone to shuttle it over to our table.) Â Nothing was that great, although I'm sure I would have liked the chicken and waffles if they had actually been hot. Â The side dish we ordered arrived after we had all finished our entrees. Â When I asked about it I was told it takes a ""long time"" to make -- isn't this something the kitchen should coordinate when they see the order? Â Overall it was basically amateur hour in there service-wise and I would never go to Root and Bone again. Â There are too many places in new york with both good food AND good service to put up with anything that lousy.",1
5094,14,4,1/6/2015,"Delicious stuff -- and we lucked out with a short wait (seems like most folks are waiting at least 30 mins., and even more when the weather isn't a total tragedy). I found the seating surprisingly spacious for an Alphabet City restaurant, though if you sit in the first room in the center tables, one or more of your party will sit a bit slanted :) We ordered the biscuits to start, which was definitely a highlight. They're soft, come topped with a crispy sugar layer and ready for dipping into a chicken jous (sweeter rather than saltier) and salt. The fried chicken was very good -- won't blow your mind, but the lemon powder they dash on the crispy skin was a stroke of genius. We also would really recommend getting a couple of sides rather than an additional entrÃ©e, like the carrot salad or the roasted butternut squash with marshmallow-pepper cream. Overall, met the quality I expected from the hype.",1
5095,14,5,1/6/2015,"This restaurant was amazing! Everything was simply perfect - the food, the presentation, the decor and the lovely service. I had gone there with my friend on Monday night around 6:30pm and it was crowded but there were a few seats open by the window and near the kitchen. We opted for seats in front of the kitchen and the chef. Immediately when we sat down, there were two chefs who were both so sweet and nice and they made us feel very welcomed as if we were eating dinner at a friend's house. We ordered the whole fried chicken with waffles (it comes with cheese on top) and the collard greens with pumpkin purÃ©e and it was delicious. The best part was watching it being cooked in front of us and it made the experience so great. As a complimentary appetizer, the chef gave us deviled eggs to try which were amazing! And later as we were almost finished eating, the chef later gave us mac and cheese as well!! It goes to show just how sweet and kind the staff at this cute restaurant really is and how homey and comfortable they make you feel. I would definitely come back again and try more of the menu because everything they were cooking looked so yummy and beautifully plated. It was a great dinner and the chef's personalities made the experience so much better.",1
5096,14,4,1/5/2015,"We stumbled upon Root & Bone by accident. We were down in this hood because I had a groupon for a place nearby. In my infinite wisdom I didn't see what time that place opened...which was 5pm...not 1pm when we were there. womp womp...Well Yelp to the rescue. This came up at the top with 4 stars. And well, we were standing right next to it. Anyway, it's a southern joint in the East Village so it's not really ""southern"" inside, it's more East Village inside. The waitress was excellent, and asked if we'd been there and explained the menu. It's small almost tapas style but with the option for a full plate on many of the menu items. We opted to split and try multiple things. We got the chicken and waffles, brisket meatloaf and just regular biscuits. All were absolutely excellent! The biscuits, while not amazing were very good and the sauce that comes with them was great. I think these could be lowered in price a buck or 2 though. The brisket meatloaf was not like we expected (which is good), it isn't a heavy ""loaf"" it is pulled brisket and it was great, could have been a bit warmer but still great! The chicken inside the chicken and waffles...wow. just wow. I will go back to get just the fried chicken, it was outstanding!!!! And they give you maple syrup. The drinks were good, we only got one each because we weren't in the drinking mood or spending lots of money mood. But, they were very good and had a punch. Of course the one I ordered came in a dainty tea cup...man card revoked. But it was good nonetheless. I will give this place a go if I'm back over here!",1

Â The service and execution of the dishes were flawless. Â We were able to observe the dishes from inception to service by sitting at the chef's counter. Â The devil was in the details, and each dish that went out was flawless. Â They are known for their fried chicken, which is seasoned in a propriety dry seasoning and is succulent and far from dry. Â Add a few sides like biscuits, mac, and you are good to go! Â I can't stop raving about this place to friends because literally everything we tried on the menu was delicious.

Â At select times being single does have its privileges as I did not have to wait an eternity for a table!! Â There is a very narrow entryway separating the dinning area from the entrance.

5102,14,4,1/3/2015,The best place to have southern comfort food. Our table ordered the deviled eggs for the appetizer. And it tasted sooooo good.it didn't look like the usual deviled eggs. A must have for the appetizer. For the entree we orderd the 8 piece fried chicken bucket with a side of waffles. By far the best fried chicken I have had so far in NYC. The chicken is marinated in a homemade brine for a day and then sprinkled with lemon powder and It had the right amount of crispyness. It goes well with their homemade bourbon and spicy honey sauce. Sprinkle it over your chicken and dig into it. The side of waffles were topped with cheese and it went well with the fried chicken. We also ordered a side of Mac and cheese which was too cheesy and heavy with a bit too much of salt. At the end of it we were all in a food coma.,1
5103,14,4,1/3/2015,"The place is small and quaint. REALLY small though. We (party of 2) came on a Friday night around 6pm and had two choices - bar or a 45 minute wait. We chose to sit at the bar. We split the chicken and waffles sandwich, mussels, and the mac & cheese. For dessert we got the lattice pie and swapped vanilla ice cream for the stout ice cream. Everything was delicious, only thing I would comment on is the salt content in the food. I drank through 4.5 big glasses of water, I'm 100% the food would taste just as good - if not better - if they cut back on the salt. The mussels were my favorite part, followed by my cocktail: Kill Devil Hills. My date's favorite part was the chicken and waffles, followed by his cocktail: Whiskey Cobbler. Their stout ice cream was so good! When coming here, be prepared to spend, they are expensive. I'm very glad I came and tried the place, but it is not a place I would frequent.",1
5104,14,1,1/2/2015,"So, like everyone else who comes here, I was suckered in by ny.eater's review of the purportedly amazing fried chicken at root and bone. Nicholas, our server, told us that they were voted to have the best fried chicken in New York (by whom was not mentioned). When we sat down I checked to see if my fav Pete Wells reviewed Bone in NYT. Apparently he hadn't (Wells don't got time for this Alphabet City ""best fried chicken in town"" nonsense) so I was left with a review in Bloomberg. It turned out that all of this reviewer's favorite items were off the menu. Three other menu items were off the menu too because they ""ran out"" by 10pm when we sat down (when normal people sit down for dinner in NYC). I suggested they reverse run out of items by keeping some items off the menu until reasonable time (like 8). Nicholas wasn't amused. Fried chicken was underwhelming. Grits and deviled eggs were good, and root vegetables had nice acid. Bur let's be real this place is genuinely terrible; terrible like how your San Francisco friends tell you they could never live in NYC because it's too busy, of course, only after having visited midtown just under Central Park; after walking through Greenwich village to get to brunch they report its starting to grow on them. I asked Nicholas about his experience working at Bone, saying the place reminded me of Georges' ABC kitchen (not in a good way - the place feels like it's trying to be Alphabet City low key chic but it is trying SO HARD). Customers are hustling hard too -- everyone is having their ""special nite (no not night) out in amazing nyc"" at this cool place far from the subway that the read about in a food blog - ""don't worry, Avenue B these days is totally safe."" Because really, let's be real -- $35 chicken is obviously NOT low key. The place feels disingenuous -- trying hard to be chill low key but making probably $30 margins on its most frequently pushed (but so highly rated!) menu item. I couldn't take it seriously. I left the place laughing. We'll not be back.",1
5105,14,5,12/30/2014,Amazing. If you haven't eaten here you must. Service was extraordinary as well as the food. Only thing I found confusing was the entrance!,1
5106,14,3,12/30/2014,"I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan of fried chicken so my review is probably biased here but I wasn't impressed at all. The chicken was fresh and piping hot when it arrived so that was a big plus but it wasn't juicy and the white meat was pretty dry. I didn't think there was anything special with the skin, it just tasted like fried chicken. I think Bojangles is a lot better. However, this is a 4 star because of the biscuits, which were out of this world. I loved the gravy, which was full of chicken flavor and also probably fat, but I'm going to ignore that. I'd come back just to try their other food and avoid the chicken",1
5107,14,4,12/30/2014,"The place looked very cute. I ordered the Mac and cheese and the angel biscuits. Our was so filling! I was not able to finish it. And the Mac and cheese was getting really salty towards the end. I should have asked for less salt. I guess that is common for southern food. My friends ordered the chicken and waffle sandwich. The chicken was very good, the right crispness and no bones. The waffle was made really thickly like scones so therefore very filling too. My other friend had the see waffle Benedict. The eggs were very good. However the salad was swimming in sea salt. Tasted so bad. I think I would come again if only it comes with less salt. The okras was tasty.",1
5108,14,5,12/29/2014,"Okay this place is totally Celine Dione level expensive but that's the way it is when you want it the most (there's no easy way out). We did a shared family style of like 6 or 7 different things, and each was better than the last. There's a bunch of hoohaa southern places in NYC, because I guess southern food is hip right now. Most are pretty blazÃ© and when it comes to southern food it's not hip to be square--looking at you, Huey Lewis... It's southern food with a ton of creativity, good vibes, and a handsome staff. I ate a waffle with cheddar cheese and tons of other good things, including a pink deviled egg. Not a complaint on any of it. I generally don't recommend southern food in NYC but this place is legit as it gets, if you can afford it. Oh and those hot blondes from Top Chef created it, so you should pack your knives and go ;)",1
5109,14,5,12/28/2014,That fried chicken was the best I've ever had.,1
5110,14,5,12/28/2014,"I must have been pining to try this place for at least two months now--countless Saturdays have passed by where I would wake up, head to this restaurant in the early afternoon and find myself stuck with a 45min-1hr30min wait. Since I'm not keen on waiting that long (usually), I found myself skipping over this place until I finally had the opportunity to try it recently for brunch. So, to start-- Root & Bone is well decorated on the outside and stands out amongst the other venues on the block. Strolling inside, you'll find the environment feels like you're inside a very small cottage home which helps add to that Southern / countryside feeling. The seating is very close together and it's tight inside. Like many other restaurants in the city, expect to be rubbing elbows with dining parties nearby. Excited to make the most of my trip here, me and my friend decided to try the following options on the menu: Iced Tea -- So good! I'm a sucker for sweet tea... this does NOT miss the mark at all! I had to have three glasses of it because I was so addicted. Grandma's Daisy Angel Biscuits - If you come here and do not get these, you pretty much ruined the experience. This is one of *the* mandatory items here, in my opinion... their biscuits are PHENOMENAL. Bucket of Bird -- well presented fried chicken with lemon tucked into the flavor. When the server brought it out, he gave us full detail on how the chicken is prepared, cooked and seasoned. The level of energy and passion the server had while describing the chicken made it that much more exciting when trying it! I loved the fried chicken, the flavoring is *just* right, the meat was deliciously juicy and the skin was nice and crispy. Waffle Benedict -- So much flavor in this option. The bits of bacon are super thick and will fill you up in an instant, and the preparation of the benedict was just unbelievably tasty. By the time this dish got to us, the bucket of bird had already been completely demolished so getting through the waffle benedict was pretty tough. The lemon yolk sauce is to die for, seriously. With the amount of traffic in the restaurant, the service was very attentive and can you say remarkably friendly a million times over? They're way too kind and beaming at all times -- it's fantastic. Definitely coming back here a few more times in the near future. Only when I feel like eating the world is necessary, though. Great comfort food spot. Highly recommended.",1
5111,14,3,12/28/2014,Ok - nothing too special about the chicken. Not too tasty but succulent. Still prefer KFC by far. If only they can make a KFC cage free organic farm to table version. :(,1
4752,14,5,12/27/2014,"Absolutely delicious, and worth the wait. Great service, reasonable prices, and a very relaxed East-village style atmosphere. Small place. You could bring a group, but I feel like this place is best for parties of 4 or less. Waffle sliders. Grits. YES.",1
4351,14,3,12/27/2014,"Avid followers of Top Chef will recall Jeff McInnis (of Season 5) and Janine Booth (of Season 11); while the two competed in different seasons, only some were surprised to learn that the two chefs had plans underway to open Root & Bone in the East Village. The two met at Yardbird in 2010, a restaurant in Miami that McInnis was behind, and the rest, as they say, is history. I waited a fair amount of time before visiting Root & Bone, partially because Southern cuisine isn't my forte, and partially to let the inevitable opening hype die down. When reviews and feedback remained mostly positive, however, I finally came one summer evening with three others who were also curious to try what would come out the kitchens. As the restaurant had transitioned away from doing reservations, we arrived on the earlier end of dinner and were seated quickly. We went through the menu with ease, choosing the signature Fried Chicken, as well as a handful of starters and sides to help round out the meal. First and foremost, Root & Bone does an excellent biscuit. They're typically served three to an order, but the number can be adjusted for quartets (or whatever size group you come in). They have that crisp sheen on the exterior, which gives way to a perfectly soft and slightly crumbly interior; it's best when dipped into the sweet-savory honey chicken jus on the side and sprinkled with the accompanying toasted benne seed sea salt. The Macaroni & Cheese, which uses large elbow pasta and is baked with a crisp biscuit-thyme crust topping, is also satisfying, as it similarly exemplifies how a dish with various forms of texture can be executed to a tee. And the Waffle Cut Fries are also worth an order; they're fried to just the right crunch and the dill pickle salt and chunky remoulade on the side only make them even tastier. Unfortunately, not all the dishes were as successful. The side of Roots, which had various roasted and fried vegetables, was far too soggy, a feature that dulled the flavor of the purple carrots, turnips, and potatoes that had been utilized. And the Crispy Free Range Bucket of Bird wound up being a disappointment as well; the skin wasn't as crispy or well-seasoned as it could have been, and the interior white meat was much drier than I had expected. The sweet tea brine and lemon dusting was very faint, but the spiked Tabasco honey on the side was a smart, if slightly jarring, contrast to the protein. I've since learned that Root & Bone made a number of changes after opening; the various chicken sandwiches, which received a great deal of acclaim, have been taken off the menu and the fried chicken is no longer made to order. The latter is a change I can understand, given the build up of orders that must accrue during service, but it's a sacrifice that leaves the diner wanting. It unfortunately made the dining experience average at best, and should I return to Root & Bone, it will not be for the fried chicken.",1
3007,14,4,12/26/2014,"Such a cute, warm place. Huge fan of yardbird in Miami and so excited to try root and bone. Service was excellent.. With a cheerful smile. Scored seats at the bar.. Really cool decor with decanters on the ceilings as light fixtures. Got chicken and waffles (juicy meat and sweet and salty skin), ricotta and root vege sandwich (loved the melded earthy flavors and awesome bread but the sandwich fell apart a little) and the Mac and cheese. Yum... (The cheese sauce was a tiny bit runny for my preference, though). Looking forward to try other items on the menu.",1
5112,14,4,12/24/2014,"Visiting NYC last saturday. We picked up the address from the Food Network triple Ds tv show, the old restaurant isn't there anymore, was replaced by Root and Bone, looks like similar menu. Anyhow, food was great, atmosphere super cool. Miss it already!",1
5113,14,5,12/23/2014,"My group had come from the Wild Project after a 3 day run. One of the actresses opted to buy a whole chicken for $30. Needless to say, I looked at her like she was cray cray...until I tasted it. I took one bite, walked out of the club in freezing weather, sans coat, marched right across the street to tell the cooks I can no longer eat KFC, BBQs & Crown Fried Chicken. I'm so done. Have women been dethroned? Man's place now is apparently in the kitchen.",1
5114,14,4,12/21/2014,"Just writing this review gets me itching to go back. The waitstaff is courteous and the wait time was not too egregious for a Sunday brunch- about 30 minutes for a party of 3. I'm sure everything on the menu would be delicious- what we ordered (and I would totally reorder, if I weren't so determined to explore the rest of the menu), was the: chicken and waffles (yes, give me that cheddar and scallion)- the maple syrup and honey tabasco accompaniments were amazing cheesy grits- the perfect grainy texture and melty cheese combo buttermilk biscuits- first you dip it into the au jus, then the sea salt, and finally the sesame seeds, before popping these wonderful little carby bites into your mouth.",1
5115,14,4,12/21/2014,"This place is the perfect amalgamation of everything that hipsters do right and hipsters do wrong! We came with high expectations helped along by the glowing reviews. It was late Saturday night so we were seated without delay. On first sight, the ambience is nice and cozy with mismatched china and a mix of high and low tables. We wanted to keep it simple for our first time so decided to go with the fried chicken although the chef was offering a truffle ""special"" where you could have shaved truffles on your steak for 28 dollars or a 32 dollar truffled Mac and cheese. We ordered: half a bucket of chicken, grandma daisy's biscuits, butternut squash with black pepper marshmallows and root beer. The biscuits came out first and they were good but the chicken jus was what blew this out of the ballpark! As we were devouring the biscuits, the server told us there was no more root beer. So I asked for sprite. They served me fizzy water instead! Apparently something was ""not working"". So my only non-alcohol drink option was water. When we were halfway done with the biscuits they bought the chicken. This is some of the best fried chicken I've had. The sweet tea brine...seriously!!! We were still waiting for our side of butternut squash but couldn't wait to eat that chicken, so we started. We were almost done with our food and still no side. We asked the server and he said it would be another five minutes. At this point we were almost done with our meal, so we asked to cancel it. The server said ok to our faces but I saw him walk back to the bar and make huffy gestures to the other staff. Not cool, hipster. If you don't want people to cancel orders then pace your food. No one eats a side after they've finished their main course! In the end, we were still a bit hungry ( I guess that makes us a bit piggy) so we ordered dessert. Best. Decision. Ever. The sticky toffee cake with stout ice-cream and whiskey foam was just beyond delicious and totally redeemed all missteps. I'll be back and I'll know better than to order butternut squash! And I'll not be coming with people who don't drink alcohol because really who wants to drink tap water with fried chicken??",1
3243,14,4,12/20/2014,"There has been a lot of anticipation about this place ...so bf and I came to try on an early Saturday around 630-7. We had to wait about 45 then were able to sit at the bar.. The bar is pretty cramped, as is the entire restaurant. I'd say if you're with a large group, come at 5 to avoid an insane wait to do takeout next door at Little Root (their minuscule market next door). Their e my is relatively small and everyone comes for the fried chicken. Â We did the half bucket of bird which is two breasts, a drumstick and wing. Â It's as good as they say- crispy and juicy but not at all greasy, I guess the brining in sweet tea helped with that. The lemon salt flavor is subtle but there. For sides, we had the Mac and cheese which was really a must try- it was the combo of cheesy, salty and crunchy and had lot of texture. It was a toss p between that or the grits - they don't have the cornbread anymore so that's the only way you can taste it - in the Grits! Â We also shared the roots which was quality locally sourced ingredients- turnips, carrots.. But they were a bit under seasoned and under cooked. Â We also shared Grandma Daisey's biscuits, Â which was the biggest letdown for $7. It was a nice biscuit, maybe on a tad dry side and the chicken jus gravy was light (maybe lacking in flavor?). Came with a pile of salt and sesame seed to sprinkle on which was very flavorful. We also had excellently crafted cocktails, and our bartender/server was very attentive, and detailed oriented. Â I had the Smash and Grab which was nice and refreshing and BF had the Rye one .. It was quite sweet for me. All in all, Â great food and glad we journeyed to Alphabet City to get it.. We were too stuffed for dessert, but I would be sure to get it upon a return.",1
5116,14,4,12/18/2014,"Of course, the size of the bird and price are different from Popeye, kfc...it did taste much better than others, especially for a big bird...lol...",1
5117,14,4,12/18/2014,"When you arrive on a Wednesday in winter and a place is packed, it's a pretty good sign they're doing something right. Root and Bone is known for their fried chicken since the chef came over from Miami's Yardbird. This means you should find a way to sample said fried chicken, whether it's in waffle slider form or delivered whole in a basket. We went the waffle slider route so I could try the short rib meatloaf, mac and cheese, and biscuits. Everything was really good but I have to say the biscuits were AWESOME, probably top 5 in the city. They serve it to you with honey roasted chicken jus, thyme, and sea salt and tell you to rip, dunk, and roll which were helpful instructions, though when you are the customer I think you should eat it any way you want short of pouring the honey over your face like gatorade. I'd like to come back to try the fried chicken by itself to get a better taste. The short rib meatloaf was good but on the salty side for me. It's loud, fun, and service was quick as shit which is always appreciated.",1
966,14,5,12/15/2014,"The East Village is becoming a fried chicken death trap. Â Last I heard there was so much fryer grease circulating in this neighborhood that oil companies were going to start fracking Tompkins Square Park. Â But I digress... When the ""Bucket of Bird"" was brought out, present parties declared that it was ""the most beautifully presented fried chicken"" they had ever seen. Â But as we all know, looks alone ain't enough. Â #amirightladies? It was indeed, a good serving of fried bird. Â It had great lemony tang, and was juicy. Â The special hot sauce they brought out added a good kick and a hint of sweet. For the sides, we ordered the mac and cheese and the spoonbread. Tip: don't ever order the mac & cheese AND the spoonbread... they'll run out of cheese... because it will all be in a smoky molten pile in front of you. But, cheese coma aside, the spoonbread was the standout hands down. Lovely drinks, lovely desserts, lovely staff (though, I have to say I expected more southern belle and less British accent), and a great setting. I'd be back in a flash, but now I have a tough decision to make... this or Bobwhite... oh the agony.",1
5118,14,5,12/15/2014,"I think by the time we got seated, it was give or take an hour BUT, every sip of Bloody Mary and every bite of food was absolutely worth every minute we waited! This was my first time dining and my only complaint is I wish I had more room in my stomach. To start, the hostess staff was fantastic. With over 10 years of FOH/BOH experience, these girls definitely handled the chaos superbly well. Our waitress was super friendly and had a genuine smile the entire time. Not something you come across in NYC...EVER. The food was out of this world. No brunch is complete without a Bloody Mary, although their cocktail list looked delicious. I'm always on the hunt for a delicious Bloody Mary & they do theirs well. The perfect amount of spice. We started with the Drunken Deviled Eggs. DRUNKEN. Enough said. I went with the Fried Chicken & Waffle Sandwich. I can't even put into words how delicious this was. And the whiskey maple syrup....GODLY. My friend went with the Waffle Benedict. If you like hollandaise sauce, theirs will put EVERYONE ELSES to shame. Pretty much if you have taste buds, you're not going to be disappointed with anything you order. I would also like to give recognition to Chef Jeff. (Very handsome btw.....) He appeared to be running a lot of the food and did a great job of taking a moment to explain the dishes, not just to us, but other guests as well. We even got a little 411 on some of their lighting and decor. Overall, this restaurant is definitely one of the best I have been to living in the city. The ambiance, the staff, the food....it really is the epitome of Southern hospitality and comfort. As a Florida girl born and raised, it's really refreshing to find hidden gems like this. So, thank you Root & Bone!",1
5119,14,5,12/14/2014,The best fried chicken and biscuits I have ever had from a restaurant. I don't know if they sprinkle fairy dust but whoever is the chef is doing a fantastic job. Oh and those biscuits...nom nom nom. I understand why this place is popular. I want to go back again but I need to exercise some discipline and wait a few months because I don't want to expand my waistline. The downside is that the place is CROWDED. There is barely any room to move.,1
5120,14,4,12/11/2014,"A world of amazing fried chicken and wildly caloric Southern staples greets anyone lucky enough to eat at this East Village hype machine. All in all, Root & Bone is well worth a visit, although in my opinion it is not the end all be all of fried chicken in NYC. So first of all, I came here for brunch and the fried chicken and waffles were the obvious choice. They were great and, as sad as it sounds, I think I might have loved the waffles as much if not more than the chicken. The waffles are covered in this thin slice of cheese and then dusted with sea salt and chives. There are also some chives in the batter I believe. They are amazing. My fried chicken, sadly, had soggy skin. This is usually where a yelper starts complaining and drops the 2/3 star but the soggy skin didn't ruin the meal for me. The chicken was still really tasty and the dehydrated lemon sprinkled on top was pretty awesome. The service here is also excellent and both the waitresses and chefs are really nice and happy to help you through the menu. One chef actually came out from behind the kitchen and seated me himself when I was standing at the entrance all confused. Awesome. The shrimp and grits here were kind of so-so. I liked them but I was kicking myself for not getting the biscuits instead. I think the problem was that the dish contained a little too much ham jus. Anyway, this place is great. I know it is very, very not cool in 2014/2015 to hype Blue Ribbon but they, along with Wilma Jean, Redhead, and Pies n' Thighs all have comparable fried chicken. They just don't have the bright lemony taste of R&B. So definitely try this place by for the hipster ambiance, the awesome waffles, and truly unique fried chicken.",1
5121,14,3,12/8/2014,"I'm far from a contrarian, so I hope no one takes this review as some sort of retribution against popular opinion. With that caveat, I'll note that Root & Bone is an attractive, well-executed restaurant. The shabby chic (if that's still what the kids call it) decor and the environment are appealing, down to the old-timey artwork about Grandma's pies in the restroom. The brunch menu has a great array of Southern-style favorites. The fried chicken waffle sandwich - doused with maple - was spot-on, and everything I expected from such a hot joint. The grits weren't the pride of the Carolinas or anything, but they were satisfying (in a calorically vicious sort of way). The cocktail list was also pretty solid, but in a City of financial excess, I thought they were a little low on the cost-to-enjoyment ratio. If I'm going to have bourbon, I prefer it not be in a 1.5-ounce tea cup. Anyway, I can see why Root & Bone is popular, but I think the lines are an indication that people might want to branch out to other spots in the neighborhood. There are some real melt-your-brain menus out there that deserve the patronage, too.",1
5122,14,5,12/8/2014,"This place is legit. The atmosphere, the amazing attitude of the staff, the phenomenal food! Everything was great. Super rich and delicious. Eating here makes you feel bad but in a good way...or good in a bad way? Corn spoon bread is a total must covered in melted cheese and creme fraiche. Roasted squash was covered with housemade pepper marshmellows. Yum! And to end it off we had the bread pudding. We were told it was the sweetest of the desserts and I am a serious sweet tooth. Ooey gooey goodness covered in caramel and stout ice cream. Need to come back for the fried chicken.",1
5123,14,4,12/8/2014,"Whoa. Amazballs. Started off strange when we arrived for brunch and they told us not to put our name down and just to come back in 20 minutes and we'd be seated. Following the hostess's orders we came back in 20 and she acted like she didn't know who we were and told us it would be an hour wait - WHATEVA our naive mistake for not enforcing that we put our name down. Once we got seated they were extremely accomodating. My three friends and I ordered the spoon bread the bucket of bird the cheddar waffles the pork belly bacon (?!?!?!?) and the mac and cheese we also got bloody mary's that had a stick of beef jerky inside! (how exciting!) the chicken was so perfect as was the rest of meal. Would 1,000% come back for brunch, lunch, dinner....anything really...",1
5124,14,5,12/7/2014,"This place was amazing. I went with a party of 4 on a Saturday night. We put it our name at 730 and were seated at around 830, which is exactly what we were expecting. The service was great - our waitress was very helpful and made good recommendations. Also, the price point is really good. We each paid $34 + tip and we ate a LOT. Switchblade cocktail - I love cocktails with mezcal, and this was no exception. It was tart and exactly what I wanted. Spoonbread - my friends and I still do not know what spoonbread is, but it is delicious. It comes in a skillet and is essentially the consistency of very creamy polenta. It has a cream on top. This is an absolute must if you eat here. Mac and cheese - really good as well, a perfect ratio of the pasta and the cheese. It was creamy and really well seasoned. Deviled eggs - I am a big fan of deviled eggs, and had heard that they were delicious here. I thought they were good, but nothing epic. They're not a must. Bucket of chicken - this was amazing. We did the full bucket and had food left over. The chicken is perfectly fried and not greasy and is very juicy. Butternut squash - this was very good, but didn't stand out. Sticky toffee pudding - this comes with stout ice cream, which is delicious. I thought it was the standout of the dessert.",1
5125,14,5,12/7/2014,"Last minute decision and it was the best decision. The gooey cornbread , Mac and cheese, and fried chicken waffles was the best I've had in a long time. great staff and service.",1
5126,14,5,12/5/2014,"Great atmosphere, amazing food (honestly, the best chicken I've had in my life), wonderful staff. I was stuffed, but still ordered dessert. I just wanted to eat there forever. (It's also a great date spot!)",1
5127,14,5,12/5/2014,"I thought it was going to be bad when Root & Bone doesn't take reservations. But on the weekday night I went, there were a few tables available at 7ish. It was pretty odd the hostess offer the bar tables facing outside to us when there are plenty of tables available. So make sure you inquire if there's any table available. The decor of this place is really homey and warm. It has that old country look which suits perfectly to their Southern-inspired menu. The handle of the beer tap are different kind of bones. Finally, back to food. I am glad the waiter suggested the Gooey Corn Spoonbread. With the buttermilk whip on top, it was delicious. The drunken deviled eggs are not average at all. I am glad the waiter explained to us why the egg white is pinkish. They were soaked in beet juice before it was served. There was only 3 halves of eggs but it was pefect given the many things we ordered. The Mac & Cheese is made with big pasta. And the softness of the pasta was perfect. This is one of my fav M&C in the city. We also have the half-bird. It was very crispy and I really like the flour they use to fry the chicken. Half bird is more than enough for a party of 2. We had plenty of leftovers. I will definitely return to this place again, though not sure when given it's in alphabet city...",1
5128,14,5,12/1/2014,Food is so awesome. Creative dishes with a homemade touch. The squash with marshmallow cream was the best I ever had. Looking forward to coming back here again.,1
5129,14,4,11/30/2014,"Mac & cheese side was DELICIOUS. I would come back just for that. Their chicken and waffles were wonderful as well. I had the skrimps and grits and it was great as well, just a little too much bacon. Overall, it was great food and great atmosphere.",1

It's very nicely decorated. As for the food, it's pretty good. Southern style comfort with a hippy and creative twist. The biscuits were really good. Buttery and flaky with a beef dipping Au jus. A favorite of mine. The waffle fried chicken sandwich was good but there were several drawbacks from all the pickled stuff included. Pickled green tomato, ocra, pickles and shallot was a bit much. Of course you can remove them but the couple of bites sorta turned me off. Also, the fried chicken felt a bit salty. It's all a matter of preference but you should still try it. Mac n cheese was freaggin good. That's all you need to know. Get it. The root potatoes were good. A couple of surprise onion rings and the almighty sweet potato was nice.",1
5131,14,5,11/27/2014,Just got take out thanksgiving. Fried turkey and biscuits were out of this world. The staff was kind and helpful. Â Pecan pie was so-so. Excited to test out their chicken.,1
5132,14,3,11/26/2014,I was excited about coming here because I've read so many reviews and I live in the neighborhood. I am also a fried chicken enthusiast. I liked the fried chicken here but I really can't say it lived up to my expectations. I didn't really feel the brine was distinct considering they mention it when they serve it at the table. The cocktails were yummy though!,1

2231,14,2,11/24/2014,"People have been raving about this spot since it opened up, but after my experience on Saturday I'm really not sure why. Â I mean i get it, its a cool space that's said to have delicious fried chicken, but in actuality, it was the worst fried chicken I've ever had. Â The skin was ok, but the chicken itself was stringy and rubbery at the same time. Â My ""gulf shrimp"" and grits were sub-par (definitely did not taste the way a delicious gulf shrimp should taste, they were cold, slimy, and possibly thawed out while I ate my appetizer and tossed into the grits without even seeing any form of heat.) My husband had the meat-loaf which he enjoyed, and we shared the gooey-spoon corn bread, which was good, because who doesn't like under-cooked corn bread? All in all, it was ok, but I don't see us going back there again. Â  PS, maybe next time time its 30 degrees outside, the restaurant could turn on the heat? Â It was freezing in there",1
5136,14,4,11/23/2014,Food 5 stars!! Chicken & waffle was amazingggg. Gooey corn spoon bread was THE BEST! will go back just for that! Skrimps grits was good.. a lil salty but still good. Went with a friend saturday around 1:30 and the wait was about 1 hr. Totally worth the wait. There are couple stores here n there and a playground in the neighborhood to kill time. Theyll call/txt u when ur table is ready. The guy who brought us our food explained each plate. Super friendly. And friendly bartender! 4stars for the longgggg wait!,1
5137,14,5,11/23/2014,"I can easily say this my favorite place for brunch to date. Everything was so so good. We ordered brunch drinks, I ordered a mimosa which was deliciously refreshing. We then ordered the deviled eggs which lord, they were the best deviled eggs I've ever had. I recommend it! I ordered the chicken and waffle sandwich and I was in the zone. Literally everything went mute and it was just me and that crispy moist chicken on top of that sweet soft waffle, dripping in some type of sauce. My date enjoyed his poached eggs on waffles as well. The servers were all friendly and looked happy to be there. It's such a cute restaurant, so warm and welcoming. I will definitely come back!",1

Okay, fair enough, its a Friday night in NYC. We go grab a drink and come back in just under two hours. We wait about ten more minutes, at which point the hostess finally acknowledges us. Then, with a totally straight and unapologetic face, she says that its going to be another hour. Not. A. Chance.",1

Â It appears to be smaller than it is, that being said, there will be a wait because it is packed so plan your trip out. Â You can make reservations or they take your number & can call you when your table is ready. Â When we got there we had about a 30 minutes wait & went around the corner to Mama's Bar for a drink. Â When the hostess called us we went right over and were seated at the Chef's Corner. Â Our server was friendly & knowledgable. Â  Now onto the food we got the whole bird fried chicken with the cheddar waffles, the honey biscuits with chicken jus, & the mac & cheese. Â The fried chicken was amazing - perfectly crunchy & juicy. Â Also added bonus you can request white or dark meat & of course depending on availability they will bring out your preference!!!! Â  The honey biscuits were so fluffy, mildly sweet & of course buttery, they were melting in my mouth & the chicken jus was a great compliment to these flavors. Â The cheddar waffles were just ok, to be honest could've done with out them. Â The mac & cheese however was great, it had the just the right amount of cheesiness. Â  The drinks were ok - I think the cocktails are just a little to tart for me. That being said overall I had an amazing experience here.

5141,14,4,11/17/2014,"Brunch is the best time to check out this charming southern-inspired resto apparently by two Top Chef alumni. Get there early on weekends or else you will wait (probably outside). While everyone raves about the chicken waffles and Mac and cheese, my favorite dish had to be the short rib meatloaf. It was a perfectly tender, falling apart and flavorful roast. The chicken waffle was good in theory but the execution was poor as it wasn't piping hot and the cheese had congealed a little bit. The Mac and cheese was ok, I like a more cheesy sauce than saucy cheese, if that makes any sense. Most of the cocktails and beers are bitter which is great with the fried food. The southern farmhouse decor is super cute. If I were to return I'd try the half fried chicken and get the meatloaf again!",1
5142,14,5,11/16/2014,"If you are from the southern area, this is as close as you can get. Of course the fried chicken is not as good as what you get from Georgia or Alabama, but it's fresh! Not crazy about their shrimp and grits because I like mine simple. Theirs is a little too much on spice and ingredients. The cheese wAffle is genius! So yummy!!!! Me and my frds were so full but we just couldn't stop eating. We went around noon and I was going to try one of their drinks. But they didn't have it because they make their syrup and stuff fresh and they were out. Staff are attentive, but we did notice most of they playing with their phone all the time which is a little unprofessional. I will def. come back! And you should try it too!",1
5143,14,3,11/16/2014,"Ok after reading this place mentioned on Thrillist a million times, I was really worked up to try this place. Boyfriend and I headed over around 7 pm, and the wait was an hour. Â The host took our phone number to call us when a table was ready, and we wandered away. A little over an hour later, we (very hungrily) went back to the restaurant, and I overhead the wait was now 3 hours long! Â Two more people were still ahead of us, mainly because a table of six girls were lingering over an empty wine bottle and empty glasses (why don't places kick people out who aren't buying? So annoying). Â We finally got seated at the bar counter by the windows. Â It may all be in my head, but I'm pretty sure the cold air from outside contributed to our hot food cooling down to room temperature at a faster-than-normal rate. Ordered the mac and cheese--just order it. Â Thank me later. Â It is divine and you will love me for suggesting it to you. Â The applejack smash cocktail was quite excellent as well. The chicken and waffle sandwiches on the other hand...I was kind of disappointed. Â I didn't realize it would be open faced (the few photos I saw on Yelp featured a traditional looking *sandwich*) and buried under a forest of watercress. Â My verdict is there are too many competing flavors in the sandwich: Â a cheddar waffle, a pickled green tomato, cheddar cheese, butter garlic pickles, and the sweet tea brined fried chicken skewered with pickled okra and a small pickled red onion: Â holy pickled everything! Â There was scant chicken in the breading. Â It wasn't particularly fryer-fresh hot when it was served, and most of my bites were of the tooth-breaking hard breading. Â Given this place's description as ""southern"" and ""comfort food,"" well, I don't find anything comforting about this rock hard chicken that doesn't taste southern. I want to believe this is a great place. Â I'd give it another shot--but I'm not waiting three hours for it.",1
5144,14,5,11/16/2014,"Love this place!! Love everything about this place: the name, decor, people, and fooood. Their mix of femininity and masculinity is so well done through their beautiful decor, the food, and of course their name. The food is quite amazing. These people definitely know good, quality food, and a lot of their dishes are executed in a very smart way. A lot of their dishes are very unexpected but they all work so well in flavor & taste.

5145,14,3,11/16/2014,"Coming here, I had high expectations for their fried chicken and their take on Southern comfort food. I would say their take is classier, as befits New York. I am not an expert on Southern food, but I did not get the satisfying feeling you get after you eat comfort food. Thurs. night at 6pm, the wait was not too bad for 4 people. If you come at 6pm, right on the dot, there is only a 10 min. wait. They will only seat you with your whole party there. Crispy Free Range Bucket of Bird - This consists of two wings, two breasts, legs, a thigh. It was good fried chicken, but I wouldn't say it was the best I have eaten. It is free range so less greasy and on the leaner side. With the description of tea-brined with lemon, I expected some unique zest to it, but I did not taste anything out of the ordinary. The chicken wing was nice and moist, but the breast was really dry, as expected of white meat. Tabasco Whiskey Honey Sauce - Perfect sauce on the chicken. The chicken is not as great without it. Grandma Daisy's Buttermilk Angel Biscuits - Delicious. We thought it came with 3, so added an extra one for added cost, but instead we got 5? On the side, they give you honey roasted chicken jus, fresh thyme, and toasted benne seed sea salt. Dipped in the sauce, the biscuits take on a sweet taste. Though small, the biscuits were incredibly fluffy. Macaroni and Cheese - This dish was bland to me. There was not much taste to it, despite looking so cheesy. Root Vegetables - Full of interesting colored rainbow vegetables, including purple carrots, potatoes, turnips, etc. I loved the crunch from the root chips, and the juicy, pickled grapes added some sweetness.Great side dish to go along with the chicken. Waffle Cut French Fries - Delicious and Crispy, my favorite kind of fry. Made better with the dill pickle salt scattered on top. Very friendly staff. Nicest staff ever. There was a wait outside, but we sat at the table for a while and they did not ask us to leave. I feel bad about that but did not see the people waiting outside. The bar at the window looks out for a nice view into the open. It roughly came down to $22 per person. Not bad for a chicken and 4 side dishes.",1
4249,14,5,11/14/2014,Everything we ordered from the chicken to the dessert! The waffles are a little soggy - maybe because the batter is different than the crisp ones I like. But it comes with bourbon maple syrup! They have other interesting things in the menu. The corn bread is served in a small iron pan with lots of cheese on top. The pies are both excellent! My favorite is the chocolate bourbon pecan pie. Â The thick apple pie is served with cheese gelato. Watching sugar? You can share the dessert. But these pies are not that sweet because they have either more apples or more pecans in them instead of thickeners like other pie places do. It will be one of the 3 favorite fried chicken places I will go back to in NYC - I shall return!,1
5146,14,4,11/14/2014,"Had good ambience, food was very unique then have its like anywhere else. The fried chicken I had was very moist and season well. Pretty pricey, but you could tell the price is based on the quality of the food. The service was good overall. No meal. We went for brunch and there wasn't many people in there, at least not in our section. Very satisfied with the service and I definitely will go back one day.",1
5147,14,5,11/13/2014,"I couldn't even wait to write this review, I am still eating the chicken! Â Our office ordered lunch from here for clients. Â The buscuits are mouth watering! Â They are glazed and square and topped with sea salt, and on the sweet side but my lord is this a distinctive biscuit! Â The chicken, and the herbs in which its made, I don't know what to say other than it's finger licking good, enough of batter and not overdone, moist and crispy, anything you'd want in a fried chicken. The mac and cheese isn't earth shattering but still a very nice addition to the heavy (well this is southern food) meal. Onto the decor and service (again we picked this order up and didn't eat in) - everyone is super friendly and you would expect from a name Â like Root and Bone is very laid back and simple yet refined, and strong, and full of comfort. Absolutely highly recommend, apparently they also serve brunch for you brunching folk.",1
5148,14,4,11/12/2014,"My friend and I spotted the horn/bone beer taps through the window as we were walking by and that is what made us want to give this joint a try! I liked the term that a fellow reviewer used to describe the decor as ""A Pinterest Feel"" as it hits the nail on the head. The design inside is eclectic but not busy. Beyond the neat beer taps, above the bar the lights were actually crystal decanters hung at different heights with their bottoms cut out. Smart. Interesting. Unique. My friend and I sat at the small 4-seat bar in the second room (where they do serve the full menu). Originally we were just going to have drinks and maybe an appetizer. Well that turned into 2 appetizers and an entree and 2 cocktails. The bartender was pleasant and didn't make us feel rushed (a nice positive in a city full of quick table turns). We shared the charred romaine salad to which we added the ""house-made"" bacon. The bacon was the bomb! Get that! Also, we had the deviled eggs which were pickled so the eggs themselves were kind of purple in color. Very rich, but well worth it. Lastly, my friend ordered the fish of the day, which looked lovely, but I honestly didn't try any so I can't speak to how it tasted. All in all, I liked this spot. It is pretty new (I think only 4-5 months old) and yet the menu is relatively expansive for tasty, southern-inspired food. According to the bartender, their fried chicken (in the ""bucket of bird"" section on their menu) is their most popular item. Perhaps if we go again, which I just might, I'll give that a shot.",1
5149,14,5,11/11/2014,"I came for the chicken and waffle sandwich, which was slightly underwhelming, but still very good, and also literally every other thing I had was amazing. Tremendous Mac n cheese. Excellent biscuits. Outstanding beet salad. All leading up to without a doubt the best fried chicken I've ever had.",1
5150,14,4,11/10/2014,"Our waiter was super friendly and accommodating. Â We asked for wet-naps (which they didn't have) and he brought us napkins that he sprinkled with warm water. I went with 4 people, so we got to try a few things Loved: corn spoonbread, Â fried chicken, biscuits, and the chicken and waffles. Â  Liked: skrimp and grits, deviled eggs Ok: the meatloaf. Â  Not into: the lemonade tasted like powder lemonade Overall, can't wait to go back!",1
5151,14,5,11/10/2014,"This place was recommended to me by multiple coworkers and absolutely lived up to the hype! Everything we ordered was incredible- the half bird of fried chicken, side of potatoes with buttermilk dipping sauce, and cheesy waffles. I am obsessed with their chicken, loved the unique seasoning on the meat as well as the dipping sauces (my favorite was the maple whiskey one, which paired well with both the chicken and the waffles). Our server, Emery was one of the nicest waiters I have ever had, he was super attentive about refilling our water glasses and was incredibly friendly- we had a great time chatting with him! Its clear that everyone who works at Root and Bone loves their job, they are always smiling and when talking to them you can tell how enthusiastic they are about about the food. I cannot wait to introduce this place to all my friends, and come back and try more of their menu items (because everything looked spectacular).",1
5152,14,5,11/9/2014,Best fried chicken I have had. Not recommended for people on a diet as the food is very rich. The decor is very trendy and pays homage to the restaurant's theme. Staff is very friendly and attentive though a bit chaotic at times (we were serviced by three different people). Be aware that lines are long so it is best to arrive 30 min before opening to secure a spot.,1
5153,14,5,11/7/2014,"Thought everything was well executed and flavorful. Really liked the ambience / great lighting, music, and friendly service. Ordered the spoon bread, butternut squash, fried chicken, root vegetables, and swordfish. I enjoyed each dish and the obvious careful attention to the flavor and allowing each ingredient to shine",1
5154,14,3,11/6/2014,Supposedly the best fried chicken in NYC it's good but not the best. Really a nicely appointment small place the staff was courteous & fairly accommodating. The chicken was good Â but could have been definitely better too much lemon that it tool away from the sweet tea brine and the wings were not Â fried quite enough to get that perfect crispy Skin. Â The roots were interesting but nothing to write home about. All in all its tasty but could be executed much better & for the price not a great value. The desserts looked great but I didn't try any of them. It's worth trying for yourself but don't go in expecting the best fried chicken around because it's not quite there.,1
5155,14,4,11/5/2014,"Not only is the food good, it's super filling. I got the cornbread appetiser (for myself) and the mac n cheese and I struggled to finish it. My boyfriend ordered the half chicken and fries, and even he struggled to finish. So much chicken! Oh and I would recommend the lemonade. It's extremely tart, but very delicious.",1
5156,14,5,11/5/2014,"Very cute little spot in east village. Â The best way to describe the decor of this place is... ""A Pinterest Feel"" Â A lot of DIY decor in this place which gives is that simple elegance, yet also a ""being at home"" vibe. I love their chicken. Â Very flavorful. Â What gives it its flavor is their awesome sauce, in which it includes a citrusy, spicey, sweet taste. Their waffle fries with Bacon was a hit also, along with their mac and cheese. Â  Expect to be put on a wait list, because the restaurant gets packed, especially for brunch! Â Definitely worth the wait.",1
3278,14,4,11/4/2014,"Your typical Instagram-worthy decor and atmosphere with the wooden tables, little chairs, plants in glass bowls hanging from the ceiling, etc. The entrance isn't all too inviting, but the host is. Everything we ordered was delicious and definitely worth getting again: Chicken and waffle sandwich: They got rid of the top waffle ""bun"" so now it's just a stack of waffle, chicken, tomato and what looked to be an okra. Delicious despite the waffle being a little too soft, borderline soggy, but I guess that's inevitable when you top it with just cooked chicken. Basket of chicken: Seasoning good. Crispy. Delicious. No other words necessary. Mac and Cheese: Was probably the best out of the three. So good. And the sauces that came out with our food? Maple and balsamic was it? Hot sauce and honey? Amazing--could not get enough. If they sold it in stores, I would buy bottles of them. So simple, but so good.",1
5157,14,1,11/4/2014,"Dear Root and Bone, We heard such good things about your restaurant and were eager to try it one night during our recent trip to NYC. Â Before leaving home, we checked your website to view your menu and hours of operation. We got here on a rainy Thursday night - right after you opened at 5:30 p.m. Â We walked in and immediately picked up on the inviting aroma of comfort food being prepared. Â We also took note of the dinnerware that gave the feel of eating at Grandma's house. Â Then things went bad very quickly. We told a server that we were here for dinner and she told us that the restaurant was hosting a private party thus we couldn't dine there until 8:30 p.m.! Â Wow...! Â No sign on the door saying this and no mention of this on your website. Â Your failure to inform potential customers is inexcusable. Â  Now, if you if you had made this known on your website (I'm sure that you had this closure planned for quite some time), we would have made plans to eat here on another night and would, no doubt, have left a far, far better review. I don't know if we will try to go to your restaurant on a future visit. Â You need to step up your game. Â First and Â foremost, place such info in a prominent place on your website since most people, when researching places to eat, start by visiting the restaurant's website.",1
5158,14,4,11/4/2014,"Really cool southern dinner spot with amazing service. Everyone from the server to the kitchen staff were very nice - 5 stars for service. Food was very good, but not incredible. Had the biscuits, pumpkin soup, deviled eggs, wedge salad and half a chicken. The chicken, as everyone seems to agree on, is incredible - but I don't like how they didn't offer a side or two with half a chicken. For $18, should get a couple sides - that's why I'm giving it 4 stars. Â Will be back!",1
2341,14,4,11/3/2014,"Go early. Like super early. I went ten minutes before the official opening time and all the tables except for maybe three were full already. We ended up sitting at the bar because we weren't early enough, and sitting at the bar for a group of four does not foster a good conversational environment. At least the chicken was good! The chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. And the honey tobasco is pretty amazing. Dip it! Don't get the crab omelet, it was complete shit. The meatloaf was great! When I think meatloaf, I picture a disgusting slab of ground meat, but their meatloaf is actually short rib! They should rename this dish. The biscuits were average. It came with a jus, but it was tasteless. Bottom line, go early and get the chicken! Half order is a piece each of wing, thigh, breast, and drumstick.",1
5159,14,5,11/1/2014,"I could lay my head on the waffles and fall asleep. Fluffy, and delicious.",1
5160,14,5,11/1/2014,"So this could have been bad. We started out by putting our name down and they told us it'd be a 1 1/2-2 hour wait. Ok. They said they'd call, we went to a bar next door. 2 hours later, turns out they wrote our number wrong and crossed us off the list after no answer. Well here is where it picks up: the manager comes over full of apologies (and biscuits and deviled eggs on the house too). Needless to say, we weren't too upset. We sat down in a cute, tight packed room. We ordered a whole fried chicken, Mac and cheese, and meatloaf (as per the managers suggestion). For a party of four, it was a perfect amount of food. They have honey hot sauce and whiskey syrup. Delicious. Everything was yummy, home cooked (but way better than anyone can actually home cook) style food. They also had some live music come in that gave it an adorable, southern throw back feel. All in all, after a two hour wait resulting in us eating at 11:30, we still left really happy. The manager was wonderful and totally turned our experience around.",1
5161,14,3,10/31/2014,"I really wanted to like this place after so much praise from various food sites and Yelp review. Got here 10 mins after opening on a Saturday and there was already a wait for brunch. There was an option to sit outside where they have a few tables set up but it was somewhat breeze that morning so we decided to wait. Seating is kind of tight if you're placed in the middle row of tables. The chairs they use are so low, It reminded me of the chairs from kindergarten class. I almost busted my ass thinking that I didn't have a chair behind me. Now down to business! Started off with a pick me up aka East Side Snap ( rye, lemon, ginger and claret snap). It was actually quite refreshing. The waitress recommended we try the deviled eggs as a starter. MY GOD! The best deviled egg I""ve had. So luscious, decadent and creamy. An order came in 3's but i could of eaten 30. Next off was the braised short rib meatloaf. On the website, they list the price for full and half. In person, they only list the price for full. Consistency is what it should be but it lacked much of any flavor. Even paired with the ketchup jam wasn't enough to save the dish. I did enjoy the carrots and poached egg it came with. My babe ordered the Waffle and chicken sandwich. Her hankering for CW is what drove us here. She didn't seem impressed after taking a few bites. I shortly followed suit when I gave it a shot. Staff was very sunny and lively. Not a bad place but I probably won't be back anytime soon.",1
5162,14,4,10/29/2014,"Dined here for dinner on a Monday night with 3 girlfriends. Overall the food was AMAZING but the atmosphere is just meh. We had a bit of a wait, since they won't seat you until your entire party arrives. The food was some of the best southern cuisine I've had in NYC, although the portions are tiny. Â The fried chicken was unbelievable as was the mac & cheese and roasted squash. The corn spoon bread was a stellar bowl of cheesy corn goodness and the short rib meat loaf was very tasty but not quite as good as the chicken. Cocktails were pretty standard and the service was friendly and on point. Didn't have the biscuits, but will definitely be going back to try these as they looked awesome. The space is cute, very shabby chic,farmhouse style decor, but it is very small and very cramped. Hopefully you like your neighbors because you will be basically sitting on top of them. (Our neighbors were kind of my heroes though for ordering both the cornbread and the biscuit appetizer, well done sir, well done.) The chairs at the tables are old school house style so you can store your bags, etc. in the cubby underneath them to keep things out of your way. Definitely a great spot to hit up on off peak dining hours, unless you have time to kill and can enjoy a pre-meal cocktail in one of the bars on the block. Otherwise a prepare for upwards of an hour wait.",1
5163,14,3,10/27/2014,"Root & Bone is a quaint little restaurant. It may seem a little small at first, but there's actually more room further inside. The bozo and I got here by 11:45am on a Saturday and we were quoted a 30 min wait. Mind you, it opened at 11:30am. 15 mins makes a difference! Either get here early, or get here late. Don't be a hooligan and come at prime time just to wait longer than you should. The 30 mins wait wasn't too bad. I've enjoyed the experience, but I must say, I was really disappointed in the chicken and waffle sandwich. Our sole purpose of coming here, was just for that dish to satisfy my fatty cravings. I've had Roscoe's, Amy Ruth, and etc and unfortunately, this did not make the cut. Not even close. The chicken was crispy and light which I appreciated bc it wasn't oily. But it lacked flavor even on the skin. If you're like me, thinking about trooping all the way here just for the chicken, then be forewarned, and set your expectations low. Now, what saved our meal from ending in a disappointing note, was surprisingly the deviled eggs which were phenomenal and had such a beautiful presentation. The colors were so pretty. Pink egg base, yellow swirls of yokie mixture topped with a tiny colorful taro chip. The creaminess of the egg filling was slightly rich but bold. The worst part was that it only came with three and guess who ate two? :: looking guilty, then pointing at the bozo :: Overall, this little southern gem was cool but needs to focus more on making the bird more flavorful. Until then, my quest for the best fried chicken and waffle continues.",1
5164,14,1,10/26/2014,"came here for Sunday brunch. Was told there would be a 1 1/2 hour wait, which turned out to be a pleasantly surprising 30 min wait. We ordered the 1/2 bird fried chicken and the whiskey cheddar waffles. Also had the okra cola and a cherry cola. The fried chicken. Couldn't read a review without the chicken being mentioned. The Holy Grail of chicken. Worlds best fried chicken. Push your mom in front if a bus to get to this amazing fried chicken. What a let down. The chicken was moist and the skin was nice and crispy, but there was no real flavor. Im not sure if I overhyped myself into thinking this would be the best fried chicken ever or what. There was a bottle of a hot sauce (tobasco?) and honey concoction, which gave the flesh some actual taste. On to the waffles. Another disappointment. Didnt taste the whiskey, tasted like regular waffles with some cheese. The one saving grace were the scallions, it truly gave the waffles a needed kick in the flavor department. This came with a bottle of syrup, which didnt do much, at least not for me. The okra cola was just house cola with a quirky name. On a positive note the waitstaff were very friendly and the food came out very fast. Overall a very disappointing meal, especially when you expect so much, flavorwise. This is the baby of 2 top chef contestants, so I expected so much more.",1
5165,14,4,10/24/2014,"A solid meal. Â My boyfriend and I went there last Wednesday prepared to wait and have cocktails at another restaurant. Â We were told the wait would approximately be an hour, we put our names on a list (specifying we wanted a table), and received a call that our table was ready 45 minutes later. The restaurant feels like a quaint shabby chic farmhouse and boasts an open kitchen. It was refreshing. Â However, this is a farmhouse that is willing to accommodate as many villagers as possible, including the occasional idiots, so you will likely be in close proximity to your neighbors, who may or may not be extremely loud and ignorant. Our table was located in the middle of the main room, which was quite loud in part due to the music, and I was unable to hear my boyfriend. Â If you're going on an early in the game date, you may want to sit in a place that doesn't mandate shouting. Â The place was packed the evening we visited so the service was extremely slow, the syrup canister we were given was a Â sticky mess, and the only bathroom appeared to be a war zone, littered with paper towels with the toilet covered in urine. Â At least people are washing their hands, so that's a positive. We ordered a decent amount of food- fried chicken, deviled eggs, waffles, mac and cheese, and gooey corn spoonbread. Â Everything was hot and flavorful. Â As others have pointed out, the waffles are not as crisp as they can be, but the chicken was crispy and moist and the mac and cheese was perfectly cooked. The gooey corn spoonbread tasted a bit like baby food to me, but I have never had that dish so I'm not in a position to judge. Â  Is it the best fried chicken in the city? Â I think that's clearly subjective, taking into account the fact that people genetically vary in their experience of taste. Â Most people seem to like it. The bottom line is that chicken is good. Â The food is good. If you don't mind the prices and are reasonable about the time you may have to wait, there's a moderate to high probability you'll enjoy it.",1
5166,14,4,10/23/2014,"Yum! Â This place is good. Â My friend and I trekked all the way to Ave B in the rain last night, but it was worth it! Â We didn't have much of a wait. Â I wanted to hold out for a table, so we actually could have been seated a little sooner. Â The table was nice, although I'm sure sitting at the bar/counter would have been fine too. Â This place was actually a little bit bigger than I had imagined. Â When you walk in it's a tiny area where the hostess' are there to greet you/do take out, and are super nice/friendly, and then there are two (smallish) rooms with tables and counter space, and one counter facing the open kitchen so you can watch them prepare the food. We decided to go with small plates, and just share everything. Â Everything came out really quick. Â First up was the gooey corn spoonbread, and it was so good. Â I didn't even know what spoonbread was, and it didn't matter cause it was great. Â Then they accidentally brought up biscuits meant for the table next to us, and after giving it to them they felt bad and brought some biscuits for us to have. Â Again, amazing! Â They suggest splitting it apart and dipping it in the jus they give you and then sprinkling it with sesame seeds and salt. Â The fried chicken and waffle sandwiches did not disappoint! Â I'm not even a huge friend chicken person, but that was the main draw for going and I definitely enjoyed it. We were starting to get full, but we still had more food on the way. Â Next up the grilled butternut squash.. had to get a vegetable in there, right? It was grilled and had salt and pepper marshmallows on top, so it was a vegetable, but prob not the healthiest. Â Last up were the grits. It was pretty similar to the spoonbread, esp with the pieces of corn in it, but I didn't mind cause it tasted so good. Â Even though we were stuffed (we got some of the butternut squash and grits packed up) we couldn't leave without dessert. Â So we were between the red velvet cake and the apple tart, and per recommendation we got the apple tart. Again, it didn't disappoint! Â It was nice and warm, and had ice cream and an apple chip on top. Â  Needless to say, I would definitely come back. Â I think the chances of going and having a wait are pretty high, but I think it might be worth it. Â It was definitely a nice, warm, and comforting meal on a Â cold, rainy night.",1
5167,14,1,10/22/2014,"I think the idea of this place is great. Â The fried chicken, the grits, the okra, etc. Â It all makes sense, I get it. The thing is, there are so many places like this place. I know what separates this place from others like it, and they arent good things. Â  The scene: Arrived on a decently warm Sunday afternoon looking to get some viddles from a place which we thought was highly-rated. Â We encountered a woman that informed us we would be able to sit in 30 mins, no problem, so we hovered. The nice young woman then offers to take our number and call us. Â We go across the street and wait, the phone rings about 15 minutes later. Jackpot!! Nope! We get hung up on but quickly call back. The woman says she never called us and we have to come to the restaurant to put our name in. We return to explain the situation, about how we came, left a name and number and were called. She informed us, ""she knew who we were"" and walked away. Â 15 minutes go by and we walk up to the nice young woman and she informs us that the tables she seated were Â people who were waiting that had been called...just as we thought we had been. We walked away hungry. Two weeks later: Following the bad first experience we decided to try it again, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice...you know how it goes. Â So, we approach the restaurant, which now has a different set up, you approach a small door that is also the ""takeaway door"" and we gave our name to different nice young woman. Â She told us that it would be about 30 minutes for 2 people and that was fine with us, but alas, she mentioned we could also order food at the window and sit outside. We figured that would work, so we ordered. After we had ordered and as we were filling our drinks at the soda machine, about to try and sit, we realized there were no tables outside, but a bench to sit and wait. Â What seemed like 4 minutes later the same woman who took our names walked out of the takeaway door with a couple items of food that appeared to be ours. Â After flagging her down we tried to tell her we did not have a table yet. She proceeded to have an extended conversation with a random passerby while she held our once warm food in her hand. Â She followed that niceness by saying, ""I told you it would come out fast"". Â As we stood there trying to figure out what to do. Â The bar next door took us in. Â Thankfully. Â So, we got our lukewarm takeaway and sat in a bar next door which was not our plan or ideal for a brunch. Â Mostly not cool. The food: Sorry to say, the best part of this meal were the waffle fries, by a long shot. Â We also ordered the $6 deviled eggs and swore they were quail eggs (3 halves - thats $2 per ""quail egg"" half!!!!!) they were that small and also tasteless. Â The cheese-covered grits were tasty, thanks to the cheese!! Â I hoped redemption would come Â in the form of fried chicken and waffle sandwiches. Â I was wrong. Â The sandwiches showed up sans tops, a la open-faced, which made for a tough maneuver if its meant to be a sandwich. Â We were hungry and sitting in a bar unrelated to Root and Bone so there was nothing we could do. Â We ate half of a half before encountering three rubbery, chewy and in our estimation in-eatable bites and gave up. Â The cornbread was just ok.",1
5168,14,3,10/21/2014,"HMMMM... It's hard to give this place 3 stars but I feel like I have to. Here's WHY. And prepare yourself for a rant. I feel like a real ""southern"" cooking spot shouldn't treat itself as an uppity french restaurant but this one does. And no, I have nothing against the ambiance of french restaurants (or price). However, it seems a violation against ""southern"" cooking laws to serve food a) in tiny portions b) that is overpriced. Despite the negativity, I have to say it is a quaint spot with great tasting food. Just be prepared to not eat your fill and leave with much less $$ than you expected. BTW - great cocktails! and they serve them in unique little tea cups.",1
5169,14,3,10/21/2014,"Food: Corn Spoonbread- Cheesy, gooey goodness, but I personally did not like all the buttermilk cream on top. After it melted the spoonbread got too greasy to eat and was overly unctuous, could have used half the amount. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Half Bird- The breading was crispy and I liked the tabasco honey it came with Â  but it was altogether too bland. The fried skin should be the best part and I usually rip it off the breast before my dining companion has any time to protest but when I lunged and ate my first piece this time it tasted like crunchy, flavorless, fat. Because the texture of the breading was nice, I just doused everything in the tabasco honey to make up for the lack of flavor in the chicken itself. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Cheese Grits- Were too similar to the Spoonbread, the grits' texture was very close to the cornmeal with the cheese and the corn kernels. So we decided to take it home and ordered the mac and cheese to see what they would be like. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Mac and Cheese- My favorite of the evening. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Service: The server was super friendly and informative. The entire staff was accommodating. Overall: It was a pleasant experience, and the staff was great but the food was just Â  Â  Â  Â not worth the cost. At the end of the day the two of us ate fried chicken with cornbread and sides, two cocktails, and two beers for over $100 (including tip). If I get a fried chicken craving in the future I'd rather pick up some crown fried chicken and a six pack from a bodega.",1
5170,14,5,10/21/2014,"Another fried chicken place? That's what I thought when I first heard about root and bone, but soon realized that's not the case. The menu has much more than just fried chicken and I can't wait to go back and try everything. I got the ave A fried chicken and waffle sandwich which was sweet, savory and delicious. Very well balanced and a huge portion of TWO sandwiches per order, which makes it great to share. The cole slaw salad was good and we'll balanced between sweet and tangy and the bacon cheese waffle fried with secret sauce we're possibly the best I've ever had. I really want to come back for some shrimp and grits and try all the other sandwiches like the meatloaf and ave B sandwich. Great friendly service with a well designed cozy interior, I really enjoyed the thoughtful root and bone graphics and atmosphere. For a place that's only been open for 4 days it seemed like they really have it down. If I had to make one complaint, I think the pickled green tomatoes on the sandwich could have been sliced thinner. They were delicious and my girlfriend swears they tasted like lemon meringue pie but maybe they overwhelmed the chicken being cut so thick. edit: I recently went back for their shrimp and grits and they were extremely good. Not like a traditional southern 'poogans porch' style that is my favorite, but still excellent. The beer sauce was great and better than expected.",1
5171,14,4,10/19/2014,"This a cute little restaurant. I love the decor and though small, doesn't feel cramped. Very friendly hostess and wait staff. The cocktails are quite delicious. I tried the Smash and Grab and one other with ginger, both good and $12. The food is the main attraction here and really good overall. Had the deviled eggs app (3 tiny half eggs total; a little stingy for $6). The one bite I had was yummy. I had the Mac n cheese (yum) and the chicken waffle sandwich, both very good. My friend had some salad with apple slices, she didn't have much to say about it. I wanted to get dessert because the pecan pie looked amazing but my friend insisted on spoon bread. It was good but I'd Â rather have had the pie!!!! Long wait, no reservations for parties under 6.",1
5172,14,4,10/19/2014,"We arrived at 11 and were told that they should be able to seat us immediately when the restaurant opened, but we returned at 11:25 and there was a queue formed outside already. Determined to try the fried chicken, we put down our names and got called back 45 minutes later for 2 seats at the bar. The bartender/waiter was so kind and attentive, which put us at ease. We started off with the biscuits and boy, are they good. I'm not usually a big fan of biscuits but They were fresh, crumbly, and smelled so good - tasted even better with the chicken jus dipping and sea salt/sesame to sprinkle on top. They were really buttery and on the heavier side though, so we ended up with one left untouched. Waffle fries are just your normal fried, nothing to write home about. Then the chicken arrived: the chicken skin was thin and crispy just the way I like it, and seasoned really well. The sweet tea brine worked its magic and even the chicken breast was juicy and tender. I was told that half a chicken would feed two but I think a dude can probably finish all that on his own - had I not exercised some self-restraint, I could've finished the entire basket on my own. Bottom line: go early and order a whole bird to share.",1
5173,14,3,10/19/2014,"Had some visitors from out of town and everyone was on board for chicken and waffles so decided that we will try Root and Bone. Â By the time we got there at 1pm the wait was going to be around 1 hour. Â The hostess explained to us tho that if we want, we can order all the same dishes as takeout and there is hardly any wait for that (15-20 minutes tops). Given we had hungry people in our mix, we went with that option. We ordered the bucket of bird, cheddar waffles, biscuits, mac n cheese, the R&B signature bacon, cheese grits and a serve of the braised short rib meat loaf. Of all the dishes we ordered - we liked the fried chicken, the short rib meat loaf and the signature bacon the best. Â The cheddar waffles while interesting and different, didn't have the fluffy texture and crunchiness on the skin that we had hoped for. We loved the flavoring of the fried chicken batter, and the bourbon-flavored bacon/pork belly was excellent. Â The short-rib meat loaf was actually surprising good and prices were decent for a 1/2 serve at brunch (more value for money if you consider 2 eggs and bacon would cost you the same normally!) Like other reviewers indicated - the honey sauce that came with the chicken was really good (I think we ended up adding that to our biscuits along with the chicken jus to just give get that salty-sweet flavor. Since we did not sit down in the restaurant for the meal, I suppose I will reserve judgement on whether there are any differences to the taste. Â Food was solid and the staffs were very friendly and helpful. Â If I could give half stars, I'd probably do 3.5 with this one. Maybe I will revise once I have had a change to sit down and eat at the restaurant itself.",1
5174,14,4,10/16/2014,"This was a truly great dining experience. Considering that I come from the South I approach all restaurants claiming to offer southern cuisine with quite a bit of skepticism. However, I was pleasantly surprised with how spot on the food was (at least what I ate). The one star ding is because they don't take reservations. I know it's the LES and it is becoming the ""chic"" thing to do--that is not taking reservations. But come on! It is NYC and 2014. My boss and I agreed to meet at 6:30 and luckily that is considered an early dinner for NYC so our wait wasn't too long. However, I couldn't help thinking how inconvenient that would've been had we decided to come at 7:30 or 8. Setting: It is a really cute spot with a very farm-ish decor. Drinks: My boss and I started with their speciality cocktails. I can't remember what I had so that should tell you the impression it left. As with every other place in NYC the drinks are way too overpriced for my southern heart but hey when in Rome... Food: We began our meal with the fried green tomatoes...which I just realized are no longer on the menu! BLASPHEMY. The fried green tomatoes were amazing. I hate tomatoes and I loved this dish. Bring it back! We also ordered the half chicken which was good--not the NYC best but it was decent for NY standards. My boss and I both agreed that there was some inconsistency with the pieces of chicken. In some pieces we could taste all the quoted flavors (sweet tea and lemon) whereas in others we couldn't. However, the tabasco honey really saved the day. As much as I hate tomatoes, I also hate spicy food so if I am saying TABASCO saved the day just know that it was really good! We also had a really fresh salad that was amazing but I also noticed that is no longer on the menu either so I won't go into great detail. All in all this was a great find and I am sure I will be back to give it another try.",1
5175,14,3,10/15/2014,"I went to Root & Bone last night (a Tuesday) at 7:30 with 3 friends and was told the wait would be an hour and a half to two (wow!) and was also told/ encouraged to order take out from the restaurant and eat at the outside tables of the bar next door. Being that we wanted to have the full restaurant experience, we decided to order a couple of apps and get drinks next door while waiting on our table for entrees. We checked back in with the hostess a couple of times and she asked if we would be okay with ""any type of seating"" so we said sure as long we're together. I guess we should have asked more specifically what that meant because after an hour and 45m we were given the option of a row of four seats that were separated in the middle by a partition...seating for 4?? Absurd. But we still wanted to try the food and were told it would be 45 more minutes for an actual table (gotta be kidding me). So we ordered take out and went back to the bar outside. The food was great - I'm from South Carolina and have had my share of Shrimp and Grits and these were awesome. The tabasco honey sauce with the chicken was unique and delicious, a great pairing with the fried chicken.The fried chicken, great, not too greasy and with a crunch. The buckwheat waffles were AMAZING. I would come back and deal with these shenanigans for the waffles alone...but probably with no more than one other person or with the plan of sitting at the bar next door.",1
5176,14,3,10/14/2014,"good food, lot of hype, and definitely a lot of waiting... 3rd time trying to get a table, and finally snagged one with an hour wait. Ordered the following: half a bird, biscuits, cheddar waffles, and mac n cheese. (talk about heavy meal) biscuits were good. bit too dense for my liking - heavier than most biscuits. Chickn Jus was great with a side of sea salt sesame, and thyme leaves. Would've liked that flavor in a more compact way. Mac n cheese - good. but what mac n cheese isn't? But their breadcrumbs were very noticeable unlike many others. Chicken... chicken....you can tell that it had uneven coating. Not too crunch exterior, however, an extremely juicy meat. You get a hint of the sweet tea brine that they're known for, but eh. I could positively say that this is not the best fried chicken you'll find in nyc. Cheddar waffles. VERY fluffy and soft, with a light chew. They could chop up the scallion a bit more tho.. check it off the bucket list and move on.",1
5177,14,4,10/14/2014,I'd say this place is a solid 4. Love the chicken & waffle sandwich...though the syrup was hard to extract out of the containers. The fried chicken was also good either on its own or with the sweet and spicy sauce (also hard to extract). The root (roasted roots) was somewhat bland. For dessert we tried the buttermilk panna cotta. Really delish. If you come early (maybe around 5:30 or 6) there isn't much of a wait.,1
5178,14,4,10/12/2014,"Came here with a friend on a weekday at 5:30 (no wait). Â Our waiter greeted us, helped us decide what to get, and joked with us the whole time - even though it started to get busy. I have to say... my favorite thing from Root&Bone was the honey tabasco sauce (it came with the fried chicken). Â The fried chicken was zesty which added a nice twist to the typical fried chicken. Â Can't say it was the BEST fried chicken i've ever had but one of the better ones. I also liked their biscuits (fluffy and soft) and their mint chocolate chip ice cream cake. Â It was the perfect dessert (light and refreshing) to end a heavy meal. We also tried their cornbread and mac&cheese but they were not outstanding.",1
5179,14,3,10/12/2014,"We arrived on a Sunday at 530 and got a table for two right away. Â It fills up fast so make sure you get there promptly of you want to get a table, or expect to wait if you're not all there. Â We ordered half a fried chicken and biscuits. Â It was fresh, delicious and served with a smile. Â The beer was $11 and not even a pint so when we go back we probably won't order beer because it seemed so expensive. Â Also, very pretty decor and beautiful windows. Â Enjoy!",1
1766,14,4,10/12/2014,"Great upscale bunch spot in the EV. With pretty much the best looking bartender, like ever. Is that inappropriate to put in my review? Do I care? No, I don't. So yeah, come here if you like tasty southern grub and 11/10 hot bartenders. OK, but really. Came here for brunch one day and was SO hungover. And this place was just what the doctor ordered. We came here as soon as they opened so there was no wait. Thank god. Got the mac and cheese, which was SO cheesy and so amazing. I also got an egg on a waffle, which was fine, but not the best thing ever, which is probs why it's not on the menu that way. My friends got the skrimp and grits and the chicken & waffles, which they said was AMAZING. The service was totally great and I really love the atmosphere here. Oh yeah and the bartender. Like, really, who the heck is so good looking that my friends and I were extremely distracted the whole time?",1
5180,14,1,10/12/2014,"I get that there is a long wait for a table, however telling me that I have to wait outside in the cold is ridiculous. Food keeps people coming to your business. But customer service will help your business grow.",1
4025,14,4,10/11/2014,"Fried Chicken Deviled Eggs Cornbread Sweet Tea repeat. No bones about it, Root & Bone is awesome at the things above. Rus, some friends and I headed to the city for Root & Bone on a Monday night and easily waited over an hour for a table. MAKE RESERVATIONS. That said, folks in a party of two were seated much more quickly. Our waitress was upbeat and empathetic about the wait, which I appreciated. I ordered the Sweet Tea, which wasn't too sweet, but instead just right! We ordered a few other things in addition to the list above (corn on the cob, waffle fries, waffles, macaroni and cheese), but the fried chicken and deviled eggs are so so good. The skin on the fried chicken is perfectly crispy, and the meat delicious and moist. I scarfed down my first piece because I was so hungry, but if you take your time (and chew between bites) you'll pick up on the lemon flavor of the chicken. It's not overpowering at all, but instead adds a refreshing little zing. JUST TRY THE CHICKEN ALREADY. The cornbread is also awesome. I love when cornbread has little bits of corn in it. People were also raving about the biscuits, so we'll be sure to try those on our next visit. So here's all you need to know: - Make a reservation (but still be prepared to wait) - Order the chicken - Eat all of the chicken",1
2119,14,4,10/5/2014,"Laid back and small, yet classy. Reasonably priced and casual, yet impressive. The food is excellent!!!The fried chicken basket. It will stay with me forever. The only chickens I ever want to spend time with from here on out; Â flavorful and crunchy. And with that glorious chicken comes a sauce that I firmly believe is the elixir of life disguised as a condiment. As soon as I discovered it, it was all I could taste, see or want for. It's Tabasco sauce meets honey. Also, the waffle fries were decent and the cheese grits were great. Can't wait to come back here to enjoy the great atmosphere & the food.",1
5181,14,4,10/5/2014,The mac and cheese and biscuits were amazing and so was the service. I wasn't particularly a fan of the chicken but to be fair I only had the chicken and waffle sandwich and I forgot to put some of the maple syrup on it. I'll have to go back and try the actual chicken.,1
5182,14,4,10/4/2014,"Came here last weekend with two friends around 10:30 on Sunday morning. We put our names down and walked around the neighborhood for a bit. Just 15 minutes later, we were called to say our places were ready, but when we were back, we ended up waiting about 30 more minutes. We could see from the window that there were spots open, but the turnaround/clean-up was really slow. This was a little frustrating, but once we got seated, things moved quickly. We ordered: 1. Cornbread: visible corn (always a good sign!) and delicious! Came with fresh whipped cream and an awesome grapefruit marmalade. 2. Waffle fries: perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Loved the dill in the sauce! 3. Half a bucket of chicken with waffles: SO GOOD. The freshness of the lemon was tasty, and we could taste hints of tea from the sweet tea brine. The outside of the chicken could have been crispier, but all in all delicious. Came with honey tabasco sauce and whiskey maple syrup, which are a must! 4. BLT: small portions, but great flavors! The bacon was a thicker cut, more like pork belly (which I'm not complaining about!) and the fried tomato was awesome. Our food came quickly, service was prompt once we were seated, and we left totally satisfied. Other than the hiccup at the beginning, totally delicious!",1
5183,14,4,10/3/2014,AMAZING! One of the best friend chicken places I've been to. Â Will def go back,1
5184,14,4,10/2/2014,"I'd crawl on my hands and knees from midtown just to eat the Mac and cheese here. It's that good. In fact, I feel like I just did it was so hot and humid out when walking over here. But it was worth every step. The hype is valid. Everything we had was amazing. My wife has been searching the globe for kick ass fried chicken for several years and I think I just found what she has been seeking. The pork chop was also delightful. Â They really want out of their way to accommodate my gluten free vegan friend too. The chef went through the whole menus and identified what she could and could not eat and made some tweaks for her too. And they were super busy as always. We waited 1.5hrs for a table. No joke. Â Enjoyed it all. You should too.",1
5185,14,4,10/2/2014,Sat at the bar and the chef told us the story about where their chickens are from. He was very nice and attentive and occasionally asked us if we were enjoying the food. I really enjoyed the fried chicken. The skin was so crispy and the flavor was zesty. You can taste the hint of lemon which gives it a good kick. The mac and cheese is also delicious. I normally don't like Mac and cheese but this is different. They have a crunchy layer on top and it's amazing when you mix it together. I originally came here for the waffle and chicken slider. It wasn't bad but the bottom waffle got a bit soggy with the chicken sitting on top of it. The concept is cute though.,1
3504,14,5,10/2/2014,"Maybe I have too many friends that are all concerned with ""health"" and ""not having heart attacks,"" because I keep hearing this term: ""cheat day."" They use it to describe having an occasional meal that doesn't fall on some boring list of tasteless food that -- while providing sustenance -- doesn't provide the blissful happiness that comes from a truly marvelous meal. Let's be clear here. The real ""cheat day"" is if you go to a place like Root & Bone and you don't get the crispy, free-range Bucket of Bird. That's cheating YOURSELF. Now, we probably didn't have to get deviled eggs (gorgeous), corn bread (not bad), salad (salad), and multiple orders of mac & cheese (excellent) too...but I had eaten some healthy fried cheese curds earlier that evening, so I felt like I was due for a little extra indulgence. Root & Bone also makes everything easier by having the sweetest of people working the most efficient of take-out counters, so you don't even need to go into the actual restaurant and bother the diners if you'd rather shamefully stuff your face in the comfort of your friend's apartment.",1
5186,14,2,10/1/2014,"Some friends and semi famous bloggers suggested the place. Thursday 8:30pm, told there was a 30-45 min wait. 1 hour later we were seated in the back room. The white wall had just been painted with oil based paint, the room reeked of turpentine - overpowered, I had to leave. My friend who I convinced to come, was non-plussed and I was embarrassed. I sympathize with small businesses/how hard it is to open a restaurant, ect. And, the host should have warned me about the very strong and obvious smell before I wasted a hungry hour waiting. I'm sure the food is good, but if you can't manage the front of the house experience, you will have customers like me... not coming back.",1
5187,14,4,10/1/2014,"The food was amazing. The atmosphere adorable, and the service was great. We ordered the biscuits, which come with this chicken broth dip, so good. The fried chicken waffle sandwich, (it was an open face sandwich though, still tasty not as pretty as the pictures), and the roots for a side, which is a bowl of veggies with pesto, so delicious. The drinks....not so good (Only reason they are not getting five stars). We ordered the Whiskey Cobbler and the Smash and Grab (I Think that was the name). I love whiskey, so I was super excited for this place as basically everything is a whiskey/bourbon/rum cocktail. They got better over time (maybe we got use to the bad taste, or the ice melted and it helped) They were very strong (not in a good way), and the alcohol tasted like bottom shelf whiskey too me, aka rubbing alcohol. Also the drinks took a while to come out. We order drinks before our food, and we were served our drinks after our entree came out. I am assuming the bar was backed up, or maybe the waiter forgot about them, Â because the food came out fast and the service was super on point with the food. Â  I would go back for the food 100%, but no need to order a cocktail.",1
5188,14,3,10/1/2014,"I was really excited to try Root and Bone, given all the hype leading up to its opening--particularly since the hype seemed to be really focused on the quality of the food, not the 'hip' factor, the chefs' celebrity status, etc. We came on labor day weekend, since we figured getting a table would be easy with everyone being out of town. Â First impression was that they were very friendly and efficient. Â The woman taking down names quoted us a 20 minute wait, max 30 minutes. Â She took down our number, and we went next door to Croxley for a beer. Â We got a call no more than 5-10 minutes later saying they had space available at the counter - awesome. We wanted to order literally everything off the menu - my bf and I tend to be major over-orderers, but I convinced him that a whole chicken would be overkill and narrowed it down to a 1/2 basket, biscuits, mac n cheese, and waffle fries. Biscuits came out first and were very good, but TINY. Â which was okay because we ordered so much food anyway, but I feel like they could be more general with the portions instead of giving bite-size biscuits. Â The gravy they served it with was delicious though, so overall a win. Fried chicken - obviously what I was most excited for, because there are few things in life better than a delicious, crispy, fried chicken. Â R&B nailed the first part, but came short on the crispiness :( Â The flavor of the chicken was awesome. Â You could taste the sweetness of the brine coming through, and I LOVED the lemon - such a genius touch and so refreshing - every fried chicken place should get on board with their magical dehydrated lemon powder. Â Unfortunately, the chicken wasn't very crispy, which was really disappointing. Â I'm hoping we just maybe had a bad batch...but given that this is their signature, I would expect it to be pretty consistent. Waffle fries - perfectly fried and crispy...but I feel like you can't really mess up waffle fries. Mac n cheese - we sat at the bar where we saw them making these, and they looked really good, so we decided we had order it. Â Must say that I was a little disappointed though...it looked like it was going to be very cheesy, but it was a little short on flavor. Â Also almost a little flour-y? As if they used a roux but didn't cook it enough. Â Idk. Â It was fine, but not a must. I'm tempted to give Root & Bone another try, because I was soo excited for it, and I really do hope the lack of crispiness on our chicken was a one-off. Â I don't want to try it and be disappointed yet again though. Â I will say that I was impressed with the friendly, attentive serve, and for a shop that had just opened up, it seemed to be running pretty smoothly, so those were definitely pluses!",1
5189,14,5,10/1/2014,"EAT HERE NOW! Wow this place is great. we found it after having a hankering for some chicken and waffles and it surely didn't disappoint. Â We waited maybe about an hour to be seated on a sunday night, the place is real small, but the hostess' who are very friendly and accommodating, take your number down, so you can go grab a drink or something in the area while you wait. Â During some conversation between us and the hostess we casually mentioned that it was our anniversary and it would be great if we could get a window bar seat. She made that happen, and to our surprise when we were seated the chef himself brought over some house made biscuits and cornbread as compliments of the house, these have to be the best biscuits I've ever had! We ordered the bucket of bird, the whole bird. Which comes with homemade mini belgian waffles with melted cheddar on top. And we got a side of mac and cheese. Its A LOT of food, I think that two people can easily share the half bird and be super satisfied. The chicken is perfectly seasoned and fried to perfection, its juicy and served with a side of honey tabasco. A++ The waffles are amazing perfectly crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside, the melt cheddar is a very nice touch. Its served with whiskey maple syrup!! WISKEY MAPLE SYRUP!! Our server was great, super nice and attentive. On our way out the chef happened to be out in front, he wished us a happy anniversary, and we sang his praises on the lovely experience. We will definitely be back!",1
5190,14,4,10/1/2014,"I was really excited when I read about Root & Bone being the hottest fried chicken place to open up in New York. I realize that fried chicken has been such a divisive food, but fried chicken should unite us.... not tear us apart. .. My guest and I waited for about 20 minutes on a Tuesday night which is not bad at all considering many patrons have complained about the wait. The chicken did live up to expectations, it was crisp, moist, and packed full of flavor. I was a bit indifferent about the sides it came with though. It's certainly quite an addition to the LES though so I cannot complain about that.",1
5191,14,3,9/28/2014,"Good first time experience. Had to wait almost 40 mins to get a seat as the restaurant is quite minuscule in size and accommodation of customers. Food was good but had expected more based on the hype this place has going around. We found the food quite tasty but cold and lacking seasoning (Fried chicken was a bit cold & the waffle chicken needed a dose of salt). Our order wasnt taken completely and despite reminders, we never got a particular item on the menu. No biggie as this place is worth a visit! Just make sure you have enough patience to wait :).",1
5192,14,1,9/27/2014,"The fried chicken was simply put...the BEST I've EVER had!!! The local catch was HORRIBLE!!!! It tasted disgusting and repulsive. As if it should have been taken out with the trash 3 days prior to my arrival. I arrived with my daughter and her boyfriend as they were preparing to open. The staff was very friendly and inviting. Since this was our second time dining there, we were very excited. We were going to try something new. I needed to use the bathroom while we waited for our meals to arrive. I did get something new. The bathroom reeked of old urine. I almost gagged! I looked around the perimeter of the toilet, and it looked as if it hadn't been cleaned for at least 2 weeks. The smell was atrocious!!! It was not like this the first time I visited Root & Bone. They need to re-group!!!!!!",1
5193,14,5,9/27/2014,"I love this restaurant, and its very talented husband and wife owners and culinary team. I am southern, so I welcome with open arms any place with great southern food to the CIty. But when that place serves food that is better than the South can produce, then that is truly impressive. I'm a fried chicken connoisseur, and Root & Bone perhaps has my favorite in the City (my other is Red Rooster in Harlem). The chicken is juicy, perfectly crusted and fried, and capped off with a sweet citrus taste. I honestly could have eaten the entire chicken. The cocktail list had so many enticing offerings, but I chose the Bloody Mary with bourbon. I loved it. Yes, bourbon. Â  I ordered the cheese grits as my side, but I don't think I shall again. They were just boring and not too tasty. Other than this, the food was outstanding. t Our service was friendly, fast and passionate. Just the way it should be. Next time some ""Yankee"" friends want me to take them to a great Southern restaurant, this restaurant will be at the top of my list.",1

5195,14,4,9/21/2014,"This may be NYC's best fried chicken EVER!!!!! I came here for Sunday brunch with no expectations. When I put my name down on the list I was told there was a 45 minute wait. We were very lucky to be seated after waiting only 15 minutes! I ordered two different yummy cocktails. I really liked the Bumble n' Bone (gin, white egg, maple, lemon, and black pepper). The signature dish at this restaurant is a fried chicken and waffle sandwich. While seated, I looked around to see what people were eating and most of the tables had someone eating this sandwich. However, I ended up ordering the half fried chicken in a basket instead (without the waffle). I also ordered the waffle benedict. I really didn't expect both dishes to be this gooooooooooooooooood! The chicken was so crispy and tasty. Some of the best fried chicken I've ever had in my life! This is only a guess, but I think they may have used potato starch flour instead of regular flour. I thought this because my mom makes great Japanese fried chicken (karaage) back home in Japan and the crusty outside is very similar (^_^) Potato starch flour makes it much more light with a very soft yet crispy outside. I am not a fan of southern food or waffles, but this waffle benedict is the exception. It was fluffy like pound cake. They could definitely change my mind about waffles forever ~(~_~)~ The poached eggs with lemon yolk sauce and side salad were also great. My only complaint is the two pieces of tiny cut bacon that came with this dish. You can order extra bacon as a side, but I wish they were a more generous size. :( Over all I give this place 4 hearts. Very cute decor and the brunch atomosphere was lovely with the open windows. ""Cutie Patroller is always on the prowl in NYC for cute places and good food.""*\(^_^)/* xoxo Cutie Patroller",1
5196,14,3,9/20/2014,"Since we couldn't make reservations we decided to get there at opening 5:30pm on a weeknight. My friend doesn't eat meat but was interested in the shrimp & grits. They said that would take an hour. She didn't like anything else on the menu & I really wanted to try the fried chicken and mac&cheese. So we sat down anyway. They said you're in luck we can have the shrimp & grits in a few minutes. So the fried chicken came first almost like an appetizer in a basket and then 15 minutes later her shrimp & grits came and then 10 mins later the Mac and cheese came. That was quite strange. Food: fried chicken wasn't anything to write home about. That's a southern saying. It had a semi sweet taste, but it didn't taste like my grandmothers southern cooking & that's what I was expecting. Mac & cheese were shells with cheese sauce and topped with bread crumbs. It was bland and no flavor. I honestly thought for a second that I was eating velveeta. My friend totally enjoyed the shrimp & grits and I will definitely go back to try that.",1

It's an open floor plan so you can see the kitchen with brick walls, white tile, glass cabinets, wooden tables & chairs so you feel like you're sitting in your mama's kitchen waiting for dinner. I came here 2x in one week haha. I tried different things both times. It's a small spot so try to get there when they first open at 5:30 PM (it gets crowded quickly). I had the same waiter both times (he recognized me) & he was very knowledgable of all the items on the menu & the preparation. Feels homey. Delicious bourbon cocktails as well. you MUST get: - Corn bread - Fried Chicken - Mac & Cheese - Waffle fries - Whiskey Maple syrup I wasn't impressed with: - Southern Peach Caprese salad - Fried Chicken & Waffle sandwiches I plan on going back & trying the rest of the items on the menu. I'm always so full I haven't made it to dessert yet but everything looked/sounded delicious so I will next time.",1
5199,14,5,9/16/2014,"Totally in love with Root and Bone. The environment, atmosphere and design is creative, hip, thoughtful and comfortable. The staff were clearly all trained with a 'southern hospitality' charm and kindness that is a reprieve from typical NY service. Deviled eggs, cornbread, succotash, $8 for the best mac n' cheese ever = all unbelievable value. There is more than enough vegetarian options to choose from. The space is intimate for a date night too. Fast service too!",1
5200,14,4,9/16/2014,"Damn this is some good food. I had dinner here last night with my old roommate. We feasted on biscuits which come with this delicious dipping sauce with sesame seeds and salt, followed by epic mac n cheese, delicious waffle fries and a half bird of fried chicken which was in a word heavenly. Would absolutely return Â - and remember to save some room for dessert next time!",1
5201,14,5,9/15/2014,"Sweet holy monkeys this chicken is good! It was a crappy Friday and everything was made all better by an awesome meal at Root and Bone. We loved every dish we ordered - the fried chicken and waffles sandwich, the succotash, and of course THE CHICKEN! The chicken was moist, juicy, tender and flavorful. Apparently, they brine the chicken first and it totally makes a difference. I've never been so passionate about fried chicken and when I took the first bite, I heard angels singing. Seriously its that good. They provide sauce but I didn't even use it because it was just that delicious. At first sight, $18 for half a bird is an eye sore but after my meal, I can say that the price is completely justified. There are 4 or 5 pieces but they're huge and very filling. I'd also recommend trying the fried chicken and waffles sandwich. I originally scoffed at my friend for the idea of getting chicken and more chicken but really, what do I know? The waffles were amazing and the fried chicken was actually a different kind (more similar to the traditional style). One downside is the size of the restaurant. It's pretty tiny and I can imagine that coming at a later time would make a claustrophobic run for the hills. BUT no worries - they deliver! *happy dance*",1
5202,14,4,9/14/2014,"Came here after work to grab some food before dessert and was greeted with amazing service and beautiful decor. I didn't get to try their chicken but I did order the waffle fries and ""the BLT that will tickle your pickle"". What was really unfortunate was that the waffle fries were EXTREMELY SALTY. I had my cup of water refilled at least 4 times because I had to down the fries with lots of water. Upon asking for the check, we were given dessert menus so we decided to stay for something sweet (could be due to the salty waffle fries). The mint chocolate ice cream cake was heavenly and so was the carrot cake. Overall, I really like this place because of their amazing service and delicious desserts. About the waffle fries, I honestly think I was just unlucky because I see no other reviews that complained about the same thing. I think this place deserves another chance so I will definitely return and try other menu items.",1
5203,14,5,9/14/2014,"that was a really good meal! we got there super early like 5:30 when they opened and they were packed in a few minutes. however the crowd didn't stop the service which was super attentive and really friendly. Â the place is so Â so cute. Â country chic with hanging mason jars and light fixtures at all different levels, open windows , plates like grandma had, lots of whites, lots of wood, vintage chairs-really ascetically pleasing. and the food---- black tea brined Â fried chicken - finger lickin good. loved loved the biscuits that you dipped into a chicken honey jous, sea salt and some sense me seeds. Mac and cheese good - little too rich for us but we complimented that with a nice refreshing watermelon salad. wish we had room for dessert - next time!",1
5204,14,4,9/12/2014,"This place is really popular right now that I had to try it. The chicken is very well done. I wouldn't say it blew my mind or was the best chicken ever, but I thought it was uniquely spiced and was a solid meal. The mac and cheese is a really good side choice, yet a little over salted and extra cheesy. This is definitely a meat lovers place, not much for those who are health conscious as well. Would be nice if they had a grilled chicken option for those that don't want it just southern fried style. That is just my opinion.",1
5205,14,4,9/11/2014,"Hipster Southern! It's a thing, and it is good and this place is very very good. Fried chicken is indeed excellent but even better are the biscuits! Amazing. Â And the staff! I have never seen a staff more excited about their restaurant and its food. Â Bravo",1
5206,14,4,9/7/2014,"Root & Bone's critically acclaimed fried chicken is everything you're going to expect and more. In addition to the fried chicken, Root & Bone doesn't disappoint with its appetizers, particularly the deviled eggs. The beverage menu is equally tantalizing with a list of refreshing cocktails and spirits. The cocktails are pretty delicious, but I wish the mixologist had a heavier pour. :P Root & Bone cooks the chicken under high pressure to ensure that none of the juiciness is lost in the process. The skin is crispy and has an interesting lemony taste to it that feels both rural and a twist on traditional Southern fried chicken. The chicken also comes with a tasty Tabasco honey sauce. You should also order the buckwheat waffles on the side. I wasn't a huge fan of the cheddar on top of the waffles, but it didn't deter me from enjoying them. Â The whiskey maple syrup and the Tabasco honey went well with the fluffy waffles. So far, these are the best chicken and waffles I've had in the city. Â Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken might still be my favorite, but this place surely doesn't disappoint.",1
5207,14,5,9/6/2014,"Amazing fried chicken. Got a whole bird to split for two, it was probably one or two pieces too much. Prices and reasonable and sides are awesome. Cool decor also, check it out.",1
5208,14,2,9/3/2014,"Waiting time wasn't bad... 20mins or so. Â The fried chicken was just ok (nothing special). Â The fried chicken waffle sandwich was terrible, waffle was soggy and it broke apart after the initial bite not to mention it was very bland. Mac n cheese was ok, a little undercooked. Â Fries were good with a nice seasoning on them. Â Drinks was over priced for what they are at $13 each. Â And the place doesn't serve beer which is weird... You need beer with fried chicken!!! Â  Would not go back...",1
5209,14,5,9/1/2014,"This was my second time at Root & Bone and it was just as good as the first time I went! The food is amazing (biscuits, mac n cheese and fried chicken!!) and the service is top notch. Friendly servers and chatted with Chef Jeff after our meal. I will definitely be coming back and continue to highly recommend this place!!",1
5210,14,5,9/1/2014,"LONG wait ... ridiculously small dining area given the hype Buckwheat waffles w/ bourbon maple syrup were amazing, but not worth the one-hour wait unless I had time to kill",1
5211,14,4,8/29/2014,"1. Â fried chicken: not the best i ever had, but still very good. Â what's special about it is its zesty from the lemons, meaty, and you can taste the sweet tea brine.

5212,14,4,8/28/2014,"Went there with a friend, a few nights ago, for dinner. Food - Good. Very good.The fried chicken is one of the best I've tried in the city. The hint of lemon with herbs combined with the crispy, crispy skin. YUM! Service - Very attentive. We accidentally dropped our waffle fries (because the table was a tad small) and without us asking the waitress replaced it with a new batch. The hostess at the door was very bubbly and quite funny. I walked in with a smile and out with some laughs. Ambiance - It is a fairly small restaurant so it felt like a squeeze (but luckily the food and service made up for it). The only complaint I have is that it was quite loud in the restaurant, so maybe not the best choice for a quiet date (definitely not when they are busy which unfortunately is pretty much every night). Overall - Highly recommended. Go, be prepared to wait, but it will be worth it.",1
5213,14,3,8/28/2014,"I've been here twice and I will say that this place gets way more hype than it deserves. Â  Like Clinton Bakery across Houston Street, it's not worth the wait. So make reservations. My Yankee taste buds tell me the fried chicken is variable - from fair to good depending on the day. Â It's really no better than Bobwhite over on Avenue C which is a much better value for comfort food in the neighborhood. Â But that place offers a very different experience. The short rib meat loaf was alright. Â My friend had the Shrimp and grits. Â It was smothered in an orange sauce that reminded me of General Tso's Chicken. The smoked pork chop was excellent - as good as Mustard's Grill in Napa Valley.",1
5214,14,5,8/27/2014,"I had the most AMAZING time here tonight. My friend and I, after reading Tasting Table's list of best fried chicken spots in NYC, decided to embark on our own after-work mini fried chicken crawl. This was the first spot we hit up. We love, love, LOVED the layout and decor of Root & Bone--it's rustic enough to feel homey, and the details feel kind of like a Pinterest board threw up all over everything...in a good way. It's utterly charming. It's like stepping outside of New York for a minute, even smack dab in the middle of the Lower East Side. We got there a little after 6 PM and it was relatively empty so we were seated at the counter in front of the open kitchen. The staff and chefs were super-friendly! My friend and I ordered the fried chicken. We ordered the half size since we figured we'd save some room for the other fried chicken we'd eat during our crawl. We never made it to the other fried chicken spots. One bite in, we looked at each other and communicated with our eyes that a) this was the best damn fried chicken we had ever had in our entire lives and b) we were going to stay right there and eat fried chicken until we physically could not eat any more. And that is exactly what we did. The chefs told us that the chicken was brined in sweet tea, so we ordered two glasses of that, too. It was the best sweet tea in the world. I actually thought I was going to start crying. Like, I'm not even joking. Tears sprang to my eyes. I know the crowd there is kinda hip or whatever but my friend and I ditched our manners and tore into that chicken, and our subsequent order of it, like we were animals. ANIMALS. My face, hands, and hair were covered in fried chicken. I didn't even care. I started humming BeyoncÃ© and I didn't even notice until I was halfway through ""1+1"". I placed an additional order to go and cabbed it to my mom's apartment on the Upper East Side because she had to, had to, HAD to try it. She started singing and dancing after her first bite. I can't make this up. It really happened. I'm writing this now because I feel a sense of happiness and peace I never thought I could achieve through eating food. I feel like my soul got a hug, like a real bear hug--none of that side-hug business. My friend and I are planning to go back next week. Our lives will never be the same. GO HERE. DO IT.",1
5215,14,4,8/27/2014,"I'd say 3.5 stars but I would consider going back there (and I didn't have a negative experience) so I give it 4. Went there for brunch on a Saturday. Wait was not bad (at around 12pm). Everyone has different taste in fried chicken right... Lots of people like Korean style fried chicken but I really don't like it- I'm more of an Amy Ruth's fried chicken kinda person. Part of the reason why I didn't love this fried chicken may have been because I ordered the half chicken for myself and it was too much (the server seemed to be new so I will be forgiving, but they should have told me that we ordered too much food). By the time I ate the thigh and the breast I was really full (we also ordered the pickled quail eggs and mac and cheese) and the bottom two pieces had become a bit soggy. I think it's cute to have ""chicken in a basket"", but as someone who loves fried chicken, I'd rather not have them stacked up on top of each other. The flavors were pretty awesome though. Apparently they brine them in tea. It's dusted with a lemon salt and it kind of tasted a bit like dill as well. I liked the mac and cheese a lot- very creamy! But again, I was pretty full so appreciation for everything was going downhill... Between two people, I'd say a half chicken, mac and cheese and maybe a small appetizer would be plenty for brunch. I really like the fact that they use free range chicken (though I'm not so sure what the definition of free range means these days...).",1
5216,14,5,8/27/2014,"This place was excellent! Â Came here for dinner after loving their sister restaurant, Yardbird, in Miami. There were 3 people in our party on a Thurs for dinner. Wait for a table was only about 15 min. Â The Grandma Daisy Angel Biscuits are like heaven. They will leave you wanting a dozen to take home with you. I had the fried chicken and waffle sandwiches -- which were delicious and plenty of food as a meal. The chicken is wonderfully crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. The waitress was super friendly and sweet. Cocktails were also really good. Â Only downside is that the space is small, a little cramped and a tad on the loud side. But the dÃ©cor is cute and inviting.",1
5217,14,5,8/27/2014,"Ate here last night after by chance literally running into this place last week after my wife and I locked our bikes in front of their restaurant. Â We normally come to the block only for our fix for 20 cent wings at Croxley around the corner but now we will be coming more regularly here for Root and Stone's great vibe, service and menu! Small place that is worked well with the seating and decor for an enjoyable time. Â We reserved the already acclaimed fried chicken for the next visit to try the other items on the menu and it did not disappoint as we were able to taste a sampling of the chicken with the 1) waffle chicken (boneless thighs) green tomato and cheese sandwiches ($15) and it was a well designed very favorable sandwich. Â The waffles were moist and a great compliment to the chicken. Â You are offered either house designed maple syrup or honey tabasco syrup as condiments. Also ordered the 2) Mac n cheese (larger noddles and velvety cheese) and a great bang for the buck! 3) fish of the day (swordfish) which was cooked perfectly crisp on the outside and moist on the inside! 4) the short beef rib meatloaf which was an ingenuously designed dish using tender and moist braised short rib meat compacted in mini loaf slices and seared and crusted on an iron skillet. Â It came with some of the best root carrot and mashed potatoes I had in a very long time! Â My wife had red wind and I had their draft pale ale which went great with all of the dishes! We are coming back to try the remaining items on the menu for the shrimp and grits, the waffle fries, the pears and the succotash as it looked amazing on other peoples tables! Â Get there early in the week and when they open at 5:30pm or you will be waiting. Shout out to our waiter Danny and to Olivia at the front door who welcomed my wife and I with open arms! Â Overall great service all around and a great quaint place to eat in alphabet city!",1
5218,14,1,8/26/2014,"An awful experience never to be repeated. Let's start by setting the stage. Â I've got a couple of friends in from out of town, we know we r going to be waiting a solid hr so we get there at 7:30. Â I said we could be 3 or 4, so put us down for 4. 55 minutes later I go to check and they said ""your table is on their entrees, it'll be 20"", I said that sounds really inaccurate I would guess another 45, the hostess agrees and we head back to mamas next door for another round. Boom, finally at 9 my phone goes off 90 mins after we got there and 30 after they said a table would be available. Â  I'm willing to let bygones be bygones if the food is amazing, so we head over and they put 3 of us at the bar U can't put a group of 3 at a straight bar after a 90 minute wait. Like most yelpers I only leave bad reviews, but the hostess and staff were a******es for making us wait and then pulling what they did We didn't even eat, we just left in disgust Horrible service and no matter how good the food, no one should go through what we just did. I suggest sending the chefs back to restaurant wars and seeing if they can win on service this time round (top chef reference)",1

Â  while the claim to fame is their fried chicken (we got a whole bird for a party of three!), i was blown away by their apps/side dishes. Â To start, their biscuits are warm and inviting. Â The crab waldorf was good, but a bit messy to eat. Â The peach caprese salad was sweet, salty and crisp with a touch of smokiness. Â The grilled corn (done a few diferent ways) was quite playful.

Honestly that's the #1 thing I ate. They also have a watermelon thing that's great, and the waffles benedict also super tasty. Decor is lovely, service is friendly, etc etc. Jeff and Janine are both very blonde and charming and attractive and of course that never hurts.

Nice ambiance and service and the decor brings you to someones southern home's mom's kitchen. Plates, tables, utensils, decor all have that kind of vibe. For tonight we were a fan of the shrimp and grits. You'll get some nice course grits, flavorful shrimp, along with a great rue sauce. The halfbird fried chicken was good too. Crispy and moist on the inside with hint of lemon flavor. The biscuits were light airy and crispy crust that went well with accompanying side dipping sauce. Skip the cheese and waffles though as they came off a bit dry and dense. Nice charming addition to the neighborhood.",1
4404,14,5,8/25/2014,"KenScale: 9.0/10 Root & Bone is a new restaurant from Top Chef alums Jeff McInnis and Janine Booth who previously worked at the acclaimed Yardbird in Miami featuring traditional Southern food. I haven't quite appreciated how great the Southern cooking can be, as I have always been more interested in New American style cuisine with global influences instead of fried chickens, mac and cheese, etc. Root & Bone proved me quite wrong. I had an awesome dinner on a recent weekend, absolutely in love with the hearty dishes coming out of this kitchen (also approved by two friends in my dining table who were huge fans of Yardbird while they were in Miami). As I had a dining party of four, I had an opportunity to sample a variety of dishes. You have to start with biscuits here, absolutely tasty bites with silky smooth texture that you can dip in honey roasted chicken jus and sea salt. I also liked the cornbread and deviled eggs (which came in pink) as well. Obviously, the highlight of the dinner was fried chicken. I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken in general, but the bucket of bird here was perfectly crispy on the outside and very moist on the inside. Given that we ordered a bunch of dishes, we settled with half bird, but I think we could've gone with the whole bird. Side dishes of macaroni and cheese and waffle cut French fries were not just average dishes you see at cheap chain restaurants either, each rich in flavor. I was also very impressed with the braised short rib meat loaf (it was closer to a very moist and juicy short rib dish than what you would normally expect from a mushy meat loaf) and shrimp and grits (very rustic with very crisp shrimp pieces). For dessert, try at least one or two Southern-inspired dishes such as the decadent dark chocolate Mississippi mud or the peach and blackberry tart that comes with sweet corn and thyme ice cream. Although it takes reservations, Root & Bone is primarily a walk-in restaurant. I showed up around 7 on Sunday and had to wait for about 30 minutes, which wasn't that bad considering the buzz coming out of this restaurant. I liked the hip neighborhood joint vibe coming from the restaurant. Definitely try some draft beer or cocktails like filthy Manhattan to go along with the dishes. I truly believe Root & Bone is a winner that I am glad opened this year, with so many outstanding dishes that made me appreciate how great the Southern cuisine can be. Show up with a larger group and indulge in a variety of dishes, and you'll walk home giddy.",1

Â At 9pm, we walked back to check on things and were told they were ""close"" and they just had a 4 top, 5 top, an 8 top and a 6 top ahead of us.

Â We also saw they had seated people listed after us on the reservation list. Â  I have lived in New York for 8 years and enjoyed or endured the restaurant scene.

5222,14,2,8/22/2014,"Wanted to LOVE this place...but such a huge disappointment. After loving their Miami establishment we were thrilled to have them in NYC. Came in on a Sat night at 5:30. Figured we would have best of the best as the restaurant just reopened after a break from the brunch rush. We ordered the 1/2 chicken with waffles. The chicken was very good, tender and juicy inside and crispy, crunchy, not greasy coating. But the size of the chicken was much smaller than I anticipated (more the size of a cornish hen). The waffles were tasteless and barely warm. A side of their ""famous"" Grandma Daisy's biscuits were dry, no flavor of thyme and cold as well. The jus was watery broth. The best thing that we had was the grilled sweet Â corn...husk Â n all, done 3 ways, homemade corn nuts, popped corn with cornbread butter and an ear of corn grilled in the husk cut into portions. It was heavenly. We should have sent the waffles and biscuits back but we were starving. We had originally come for brunch but there was a two hour wait which brought us very close to their afternoon closing so we opted to wait for dinner opening. 2 stars for the corn and the very attentive staff who constantly had our water glasses full. I don't think I will return.",1
1647,14,4,8/20/2014,"I really wish I wasn't sick and congested when I came here. But even with muted senses, their bucket of fried chicken was pretty damn good. Corn bread was unexpectedly glorious. LOVE the decor, the openness of the restaurant, the open kitchen where you can sit at the bar and talk to the chefs. Will definitely come back when I'm not sick -- this may become the best fried chicken ever... we will see.",1
5223,14,4,8/13/2014,"I'd give five stars for the chicken alone. Â Because, let me just get it out of the way - Root & Bone is some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. Â  It's a bold statement. Â I want to doubt myself for saying it - I feel your incredulity already, but it's true ! Root & Bone is flexible with how you order the chicken - you can do half baskets (4 pieces), full baskets or any kind of baskets, which is what I did, cause it's all about the thighs, baby. I dream about that lusty, lusty crust, lightly sprinkled with soft sugar flakes, because chicken skin makes the best kind of dessert you can ever have. The chicken itself is incredibly succulent, brined overnight in sweet tea (which you should also order here because it's the right amount of tasty) and oh so flavorful. Â Coupled with that crisp skin, each bite is absolute perfection, though most of us liked to peel the skin off to eat at the end, savoring the very best for last. But aside from the chicken, I've yet to find a side I like - we tried the waffles (too thick and bready), the biscuits (too dense, hard and flat), and the macaroni and cheese (very cheesy and rich). Â I know - I just have to return to try the waffle fries, the cornbread and some of those duhlicious sounding pies.",1
2005,14,4,8/13/2014,"I was aware of the hype surrounding this place and had been dying to go since they opened. After some confusing phone calls regarding reservations (only available for parties of 6 or more), our party of 5 came on a Tuesday evening around 6 or 6:30 pm. I was expecting a long wait, especially after seeing just how small the place was. After taking counter seats first, a table opened up after maybe a 20 minute total wait, so not too bad at all. Had some drinks and lemonade - there was also some delay in a whiskey my friend ordered that ended up not being available after they told him it was coming out in a minute - miscommunication!!! Now on to the food - Cornbread with clotted cream and jam - cornbread was good but nothing super special. It was a little dry. I was mainly interested in trying the clotted cream, which tastes similar to cream cheese. Drunken deviled eggs were very prettily presented - pink!! Tasted good. FRIED CHICkEN - delicious!! perfectly crispy and moist. The lemon/tea flavors didn't obviously come thru but you could tell there was something extra about the chicken. Didn't disappoint. For sides we had the mac n cheese and the cheese grits. The mac and cheese was delicious - the pasta had some bite to it and there was a crispy breadcrumb topping so the entire dish had some texture instead of being mushy as M&C can often be. The cheese grits were good also, little bland tho. We had the chocolate cake with the beet sorbet for dessert - the sorbet was definitely all beet but I just don't care for beet in general. Cake was good tho, not molten or anything. Overall I had a great experience here and was glad to come so soon after it opened....look forward to my next visit!",1
5224,14,4,8/11/2014,"Was a regular at Yardbird when I lived in Miami, so I jumped on the chance to try Root n Bone when I heard Jeff McInnis was coming to NYC. The food lives up to the hype and is just as good if not better than Yardbird. Make sure you go with a big group to maximize your chance of sharing and trying as many plates as possible. Each dish is a fun and creative spin on southern classics (ex: chicken n waffle sandwiches; shortrib meatloaf with tomato jam). Other highlights included he shrimp n grits and the mac n cheese, and you can't go wrong with the fried chicken. Also, like Yardbird, they have an impressive list of must-try cocktails (I personally love the Lady J Ivory). We had such a good meal that we snagged a reservation for 6 weeks later on our way out. The only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that the seating is a bit cramped. I get that this is southern style food and it's all about community but some room for my expanding waistline would have been nice.",1
5225,14,4,8/11/2014,"First time at Root & Bone this past wknd and it was so good that I finally created a Yelp acct just to write a review. My bro & I got there about 1/2 hr after dinner service began and we were promptly seated along the outside window counter that faces the street. It was great for people watching & getting a cool breeze while eating. Our server ""D"" was excellent. Always refilling water and being there whenever we needed. Now for the food, between the two of us we ordered the fried chicken (1/2 & full bird) fries, Mac n cheese, & watermelon/celery salad and as our order arrived, to our surprise, Chef McGinnis came to our table and gave us some of the awesome cheddar waffles to go along with our meal. He also explained to us the different sauces (tabasco/honey & bourbon/maple) and how they prepare the chicken. So cool. Everything was delicious and the chicken was to die for & crispy the way I like. I definitely noticed the difference that brining makes & could taste the added lemon flavor. The breast was the juiciest I've ever had! My other favorite was the Mac n cheese...super cheesy & liked the crumbles on top. Overall, it was just an awesome dining experience and I can't wait to go back. Didn't give the full 5 stars, just because we completely forgot to inquire about dessert, probably because we were in a food coma :) Def check it out!",1
5226,14,3,8/11/2014,"My friend Joanna and I wanted to try this place out after hearing some great reviews do we headed over here right before the dinner shift was open. There were a couple of people waiting just like us so the hype of this places still intrigued me. The decor and styling of the place made me feel like I was eating inside an Anthropologie with that rustic home goods kind of feel. Definitely cosy and in close quarters with your fellow carnivores. We ordered a bunch of dishes to share starting off with Grandma Daisys Angel Biscuits, Mac and cheese, waffle fries, and half a basket of chicken with waffles on the side. The biscuits and gravy were light and fluffy. You can peel off every layer and dip them in the savory gravy. They also include a sea salt and sesame seeds mix on the cutting board to dip your biscuit in addition to the gravy. The waffle fries were definitely a good choice. Crispy and fresh out of the fryer. They came with a nice remoulade that was a mix of peppercorns, mustard, and spice. It was a nice addition to the fries that made the dish. The Mac and cheese was tasty and had a generous amount of garlic bread crumbs on top. I enjoyed this a little more than my friend but the cheese was rich enough without over powering your palette. It was a nice strong cheddar with another light cheese mixed in. I would order this as alternative for anyone not eating the fried chicken. The fried chicken was excellent! I let my fried take the drum stick and wing while I took both thighs. The skin was super crispy and had a lovely crunch to it. It also helped that it came with a Tabasco honey for the dry parts of the thighs. The waffles were decent but didn't really do me any justice. They were topped with cheddar cheese and spring onions. They were a bit dry and just a filler for us. For dessert we had a peach and black berry tart and a banana cream pie in a mason jar. I preferred the banana cream pie in a jar. It had light pieces of mint leaves inside the mix that definitely gave a cool refreshing twist to the dessert. The tart was served with a thyme Â ice cream as well but it wasn't my favorite. The fruit within the tart was fresh and the peaches were sweet without being sour at all. Overall the meal was decent and filling but it's not something I would crave from week to week. Of course this is coming from someone who is a huge roscos fan and even a Lolo's fan from Arizona. Try it at least once!",1
5227,14,5,8/11/2014,"My friend and I were both dying to eat here, and it did not disappoint! Â We put in our name for lunch and were told an hour and a half wait, only to be called about 40 minutes later saying our table was ready. Our water was energetic, and the playlist was spot on: lots of fun, feel good music. Â We ordered the chicken and waffle sliders, peach caprese salad, and a side of waffle fries. Â The fries came out first and were pretty standard, with some fresh herbs and a yummy dipping sauce. Due to a mix up, we ended up with a free quiche to try. Â It was good, but nothing amazing. Â  The sliders were incredible. Â The chicken was perfectly cooked and the tang of the tomatoes offset the sweetness of the chicken. Â I would have preferred the waffles to be a bit crunchier but still loved every mouthful. Â The peach caprese was also well composed, with fried pimiento cheese and pickled tomatoes. Cannot wait to go back for dinner next time. Â Worth the hype!",1
5228,14,4,8/10/2014,"When is the right time to visit a new restaurant? Given the expected strain on any kitchen should they be faced with hordes of marauding diners, personally I find it pointless to visit a restaurant in its initial few weeks. Same has been my experience at Root and Bone, where I've only seen an improvement in consistency in my subsequent visits. The servers are relaxed, the kitchen is not cracking under pressure, and the reception staff is positively welcoming and warm in comparison to the first few weeks - when their response led me to waste little time in walking over to the nearby lunch and supper counter also reputable for its fried chicken. I haven't followed the hoopla around Top Chef alums Jeff McInnis and Janine Booth, but wish them much success. I did have the opportunity to watch them in action as I sat on the counter stool across the open kitchen (the stool being a few inches short of the right height). Without reading into the manic energy in the kitchen, both the pedigree of cooking and the design of the dishes are unquestioned. ""Please enjoy the biscuits hot off the oven. The best way to do so is to dip them in the chicken gravy and then sprinkle them with sea salt and sesame seeds before eating."" The server's instructions were suitably detailed in line with the dish's conceptualization and flawless execution. The soft and fluffy (not crumbly) cornbread by itself is competent, but paired with clotted cream, and the preserve (in particular), becomes memorable. The famed fried chicken is brined in sweet tea and dusted with pickled lemon (I missed the suggested hint of pepper), and served with Tabasco Honey - it's lightly fried, while providing the right contrast of a crisp exterior and juicy inside. Â The Mac and Cheese is amongst the best I've eaten: big elbow pasta with crunchy cheese toast and fresh thyme crust. The Carrot and Parsnip Cake with Maple Ginger ice cream would be a fitting way to end a great meal at the restaurant. However, for a restaurant with tremendous potential, unfortunately luck, or rather timing, will play a major role in whether you have a 4 star experience or a 5 star one. The lucky number being the number of minutes it's been since the dish was cooked for I'm convinced that the fried chicken is not cooked to order (mine wasn't on any of my 3 visits) and the same is likely the case with the biscuits. The only dish that I found piping hot on each occasion was the Mac and Cheese. Beyond this operational trade-off between efficiency and customization, there are a few misses on the menu as well. The biggest disappointment I've had is with the visually arresting Fried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich that is the subject of much food blog chatter and yelp pix likes. To me, this has got to be the worst item on their menu for the (congealed) cheddar cheese waffle is doughy, lacks any crispness in texture while the whisky maple syrup reduces the fried chicken to a soggy mess glued together like a rubbery industrial good to the limp waffle. It's pretty to look at and a conversation starter, but terribly disappointing. Similarly, the Beet Sorbet in the Mississippi mud is intense, but the texture of the crust and chocolate torte will make you worry whether you just bit into an eggshell (hmm...). Not to mention, I've yet to drink a cocktail that I've liked despite trying the Bumble and Bone, Lady Ivory, and Blackberry Saddle (all visually appealing). I don't understand why at the end of the meal everyone is handed a bone (listing the damages to the wallet), but I don't find it as creepy as some other reviewers have. On the whole, Root and Bone may not be the most wallet friendly fried chicken place in Alphabet City, but it is likely the better one.",1
5229,14,3,8/9/2014,"Finally had a chance to try Root and Bone today. I had read about the long waits so Kevin L. and I decided to show up right as they opened for dinner and snag some seats. We arrived around 5:20 and there were already a few parties waiting around outside, with more accumulating by the minute. There ended up being room for everyone though. In fact, up until 7ish when we left, the restaurant still had a few tables open, surprisingly. Root and Bone maintains a very rustic decor -- homey and welcoming. A quick look around revealed cabinets full of beautiful dinnerware and a nice, small open kitchen. We were famished and ordered a bunch of plates to share -- Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits, Half Bird w/ cheddar cheese waffles, mac+ cheese and waffle cut french fries. The biscuits were flaky and buttery. I peeled the layers apart to dip in the honey roasted chicken jus and benne seed that the dish came with -- delicious. My only gripe was that these came out barely warm. The chicken was delicious! A thin, crispy and flavorful skin encompassing some juicy meat. I expected more of a zing since I read that it is pickled lemon dusted but I didn't taste anything of the sort. Still solid fried chicken and definitely a must do. We added the cheddar cheese waffle for $7, and it came with 4 mini waffles. I was not a fan of these -- I found them to be too dry and bland. I was also expecting the cheddar cheese to be more incorporated into the waffle rather than melted on top. The cheese also started to solidify after a few minutes and looked very unappetizing. This definitely fell short for me. The waffle fries were insanely crispy and good. It came with this intense but tasty chunky remoulade that I happily double-dipped into with each fry. The mac and cheese was decent although not memorable. There was too much of the crunchy crust on top, about an inch worth! It would have been ok but I didn't like the texture or taste of it. For dessert, we had the Banana Cream and the Peach+Blackberry Tart. I enjoyed both. The banana cream came in a mason jar. It was a good consistency -- thick and creamy, with huge chunks of banana and honey graham throughout. There was also a sprinkle of mint that was very refreshing. The Peach+Blackberry Tart was a great summer dessert. The fruits were so fresh and the tart was nice and crumbly. I expected it to be sweeter since it was coated in brown sugar but that was not the case -- the sugar gave it a nice crunchy texture. This tart also came with thyme ice cream -- a first for me. So refreshing and it definitely worked with the tart but I don't think I could eat it alone. Overall, a decent meal. I'm not sure if it was memorable enough to warrant a return visit though.",1
5230,14,3,8/9/2014,"A few weeks after eating here, I forgot the details (whoops) but I do remember the excellent service, cocktails, and coma-inducing dishes. We started with delicious biscuits with drizzles of savory jus (to be blamed later for filling us up too early). I had the lamb and must say that it was the fattiest lamb I've ever had -- delicious, but maybe needed a zing of acidity on the side to cut through all the fat and texture of the sweet potato leek gratin. My husband had the obligatory fried waffle and chicken sandwich and while I was too busy to try it, it seemed to kick his ass, in a good way -- for a guy who should eat professionally, he flew the white flag up when he got to the second sandwich. It was a lot to eat and our server read our cues well enough to know we were ready for a doggy bag. The Twisted Mustache cocktail was robust with ginger, bourbon, and squeeze of citrus. Overall, we wish we could've saved more of our appetite for the main dishes because they really were delicious lunches the following day.",1
5231,14,5,8/9/2014,"LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!!!! Got takeout of fried chicken, sprouting garden salad and devil eggs to go. Chicken, lightly breaded, spicy and delicious. The sprouting garden salad is beautifully presented and refreshing. And they even carefully packed the devils eggs so we can appreciated how gorgeous those little devils are!! Can't wait to go back and have a sit down meal",1
5232,14,4,8/8/2014,"Our party of four lucked out one recent Tuesday evening when, rather than a standard 2-ish hour walk-in wait, a cancellation had us seated in about 30 minutes. This place is better enjoyed with a group so you can try even more of their menu. Fantastic drinks and friendly service. The deviled eggs were tasty but a little on the soggy side (I couldn't pick up my half). The chicken jus served with the biscuits was a little too rich for my taste. But unequivocally high raves to the cheddar waffle and waffle fries (the dill!) and of course the fried chicken (the lemon!). I also love that they offer takeaway fried chicken. Two from our party were back within a week to get more that way!",1
5233,14,1,8/7/2014,Don't waste your time here. They say 45min 2.5 hours later they were still telling us 45min. For something you could get pretty much anywhere in New York.,1
5234,14,3,8/5/2014,"If there's anything that will get me to treck from my abode on the UWS to the LES - it's fried chicken. Â I had high expectations. Not disappointed. Some really good fried chicken. But what I really loved more were the biscuits with gravy! YUUUUUM. Â Don't get me wrong, the chicken was great (nice and juicy with a crispy flavorful skin) but it was a TAD salty. Nothing to complain about. But I did feel thirsty the rest of the night. The waffle fries were definitely too salty though - so much so that we asked them to take them back. Our waiter was super cool about it though so it wasn't a big deal. We got new (less salty) fries but by then we were already deep into fried chicken and fries were forgotten. Worth checking out. But probably won't make the trek again unless it's for a birthday or other reason for me to go.",1
5235,14,5,8/5/2014,"This is my first Yelp review as I felt inspired to suggest this restaurant to others! This place is fantastic! A few friends and I were walking around the neighborhood on a Monday night looking for a quick bite and we were pleasantly surprised to find this gem. Bustling and busy, we were nervous there would be a long wait. The hostess was very kind and assured our party of four that if we ""stayed with her"" she would seat us right away. She followed through on her word and we were seated in minutes at the kitchen bar. We spoke to the chef about his preparation and the menu. He made excellent suggestions. The four of us split the half chicken, waffles, mac and cheese, and the shrimp and grits. ALL fantastic and plenty of food for four people. I was impressed by the intricate care performed to prepare and cook the food. Priced very reasonably, we left incredibly full and happy for around $30/person - Â and each had a cocktail! We had a lovely waiter who brought us biscuits on the house - this may have been my favorite dish of the evening, especially dipped in the roast chicken sauce. I want to come back here for brunch or dessert. A 'come hungry, leave happy' type of place.",1
4943,14,5,8/5/2014,"I've been eagerly anticipating the opening of this charming little restaurant for several reasons. First, I loved Yardbird in Miami so I was excited that Jeff McInnis is opening his own restaurant in NYC. Second, this place is only a couple blocks from my job. And then of course, there's been a lot of hype before they even opened. On their first week of opening I walked over to get some lunch. While I waited for my food I took a peek at the dining area. Its charms come from the adorable little details. I've yet to dine in but I'll be sure to do that for dinner in the future. In the meantime, I'm in love with the chicken and waffle sandwiches for lunch. The fried chicken is perfection! It comes sandwiched between 2 pillowy waffles along with pickled green tomatoes. Oh and of course, the maple syrup us spiked with bourbon. How can I resist? Originally they had more sandwiches for lunch but it seems like after the first couple weeks they decided to work with a smaller menu. In any case I'm definitely coming for dinner in the very near future.",1
5236,14,4,8/2/2014,"My bf and I arrived at 5:35pm on a Sunday, and there was a line out the door (maybe 10 people or so). Luckily, as soon as we got in line, they started seating and we were able to grab a couple of seats with a view of Jeffrey McInnis in action. Sweet! We had the cornbread, southern peach caprese, shrimp & grits, half bucket of bird, and the Mississippi mud pie with cherry-beet sorbet. All of the dishes were solid. I think what sets the food here apart is the care in the layering of different flavors and textures. The caprese, for instance, has several different but cohesive levels of sweetness--from the fruity grilled peaches to the deep molasses in the vinegrette to the herbally basil. There was also a nice sharpness that cut through the sweetness in multiple ways with the green tomatoes, the molasses vinegar and the pimento cheese. Every ingredient seemed very considered and nothing overpowered another. The dish was really subtly balanced. The chicken btw was the juiciest fried chicken I have ever had, and it was--despite being fried--surprisingly light. My bf was not a big fan of the lemon powder but I think it worked well when combined with the Tabasco honey sauce. The mud pie was really good. Wished it was a tad bigger but maybe that's just my gluttony speaking--the two of us were nice and full at the end of the meal. But I wish the sorbet tasted of cherries a bit more. I tasted more beet than cherry. We definitely plan to come back--both to try more dishes in-house and maybe even some bucket of bird to-go!",1
5237,14,5,7/30/2014,"Long review...MAKE SURE TO ORDER THE FRIED CHICKEN! Root & Bone is from two Top Chef alum (Jeff McInnis and Janine Booth) and has been blowing up my Instagram feed from fellow foodies posting drool-worthy pics of chicken and waffles! This spot doesn't take reservations, so we arrived right when it opened (11:30am-ish). When our server told us about the special Bourbon Bloody Mary I was ALL over it. When it arrived and I saw all the yummy garnishes (BACON! PICKLES! OLIVES!), I was even more stoked! The executive chef is known for fried chicken, so I knew I had to order it. There was simply nothing to think about. I got a half order of the Crispy Free-Range Chicken. It is sweet tea brined and served with pickled lemon dust and spiked Tabasco honey. I'm really not sure where to start. The chicken was delicious. Each bite was awesome. The skin was perfectly crisp, the meat was moist and the sweet tea brine was a wonderful complement to the salty skin. I love the taste combination of salty & sweet, so I was in HEAVEN! There is an option to add a cheddar cheese waffle and whiskey maple syrup. CLEARLY I did that. I was surprised when 4 mini waffles appeared instead of one large waffle. They were super cute! The cheese ended up hardening up and cooling down. I'm undecided on this presentation style - it was just congealed, not that sexy. I'd suggest that the cheese be shredded and integrated into the batter or turned more into a cheese sauce. I also read that the mac & cheese was super delicious, so we ordered a side. Naturally, it was huge. The mac is made with big elbow pasta, crunchy cheese toast and a fresh thyme crust. We loved it but hardly made a dent in it - eek! Lauren ordered the Southern Peach Caprese made with fried pimento cheese, grilled peaches, pickled green tomatoes, heirloom tomatoes, sticky molasses vinegar and basil. She loved it! I wanted no part of any sort of salad as I was elbow deep in CHICKEN N WAFFLES YO! When we got the check, it was rolled up in a bone. I thought this was a nice (somewhat spooky) touch and attention to detail. Come here and order the chicken!! Since you can't make reservations, I'd recommend coming right at opening or at non-peak meal times.",1
5238,14,5,7/30/2014,"Its a little packed, but the food is well worth it -- especially for my wife who's a transplanted southerner. Â Their meatloaf was among the very best we've ever had and the chicken & waffles are incredible. Â The blue crab dish wash the only thing that didn't register as phenomenal. Â Go as soon as you can!!!!!!",1
5239,14,3,7/30/2014,"I wasn't as in love as I hoped I would be. Â The tables are a bit crowded together. Â The drinks were pricey for the size. Â The chicken was good but not worth $36 especially since nothing comes with it. Â Honestly, I like Palace fried chicken just as much. Â The appetizers were pretty good as well as the biscuits. Â Our waitress was very sweet and accommodating. The decor was a bit bland as well. Â  Not sure I will go back.",1
5240,14,5,7/29/2014,"A friend of mine from Florida recommended this place as they knew Chef Jeff personally. Â It's a little off the beaten path from subways (we're in Chelsea) for us but the minute we walked in and read the menu, we knew we were in the right place. Â Rarely do I find a place where I want to try every dish but this was definitely the case here. Â We went on a Sunday for brunch around 12:30PM. Â This was their 3rd week in business according to the hostess. Â It was packed! Â That said, we waited about 10 minutes and were sat in the back room. Talk about great waiting time. Â That's a miracle in NYC. Â  In true NYC fashion, the seating was a bit tight but not uncomfortable. Â I saw the guy next to me had a bloody mary with bacon in it. Â Bacon?!?! Â Had to get it and I'm not even a bloody mary kind of guy. Â The service was excellent. Â They came and checked in with us frequently. Â Let's get to the food. We were having a dilemma with the fried chicken. Â We didn't want a half or a full (as we wanted to try other dishes) but definitely had to try it as that is what they're known for. Â We asked if we could just order 1 or 2 pieces. Â No problem they said. Â I got a drumstick and my wife got a thigh. Â It comes served with a syrupy tabasco tasting syrupy sauce. Â The chicken was off the hook!!! Â It was so moist and falling off the bone. Â I wish I would've gotten more of it. We then tried the caprese salad. Â I don't know if was seasonal or not but the peaches were unbelievably good. Â We were 2 for 2 so far and we hadn't even gotten to the main courses. I got the eggs benedict which was on top of a waffle instead of a muffin. Â It had a little side salad and bacon as well. Â The eggs benedict was up there as far as quality but not the best I've ever had. Â The waffle was a good touch, however and kept it interesting. But being a bacon guy, that was total quality! Â Thick and Juicy. Wish I would've ordered another side of it. The wife shared that with me because she wanted to try the ""Grits Made With Love"" as it's referred to on the menu. Â It comes with bread crumbs, chives on top with pimento cheese. Â It was a good dish. Â I'm not a grits person but my wife loved it, though we both agreed we wouldn't mind trying a different dish next time. We tried the waffles for dessert. Â It came with strawberries, granola, whip cream and syrup. This was the only real letdown of the whole meal. It was just OK. I probably wouldn't order them again. Â The size of the waffles (they're minis) were fine for a dessert but not for a main course. Â The taste was just OK. Â  Then came the price...$70 for both of us. Â We thought this was so WORTH it! Â In NYC, that's a bargain for that quality. Â I've had a LOT worse for way MORE. Â All in all, highly recommend this place. Â One of the best brunch spots we've been to. Â We look forward to coming back and trying some other dishes.",1
5241,14,4,7/27/2014,"Yummy fried chicken! I still miss sweet home Alabama food, atmosphere and people even though the company was stellar and I could not ask for better friends.",1
5242,14,3,7/26/2014,"Was so excited to try Root and Bone since I'm a huge fan of Yardbird in Miami. Unfortunately the food was a bit of a disappointment. I had the half bird, waffle fries, and a couple drinks. The drinks were phenomenal and I highly recommend them but the food was so salty I think I'll be thirsty for days. Wish I liked it better!",1
5243,14,5,7/26/2014,"This was such a refreshing and pleasant dining experience. Â I can't say enough how satisfying the food was and the service was sincerely friendly. Half bucket of chicken: Everything was perfect about it. Â It was perfectly seasoned and extremely juicy. Â I can't forget how crispy the skin was. Short rib meatloaf: Â I'm not sure if meatloaf is the right name for this dish because it's not ground meat and is much better than any meatloaf. Imagine taking a well braised short rib and using all the shredded meat to form a square patty. Â Then crisp the outer edges on a flat top and this is what you get. Mac n cheese: Â This what you expect from a great bowl of mac n cheese. Â It was creamy, cheesy, Â al dente, and crispy on top. Â You can't ask for more than that. Ice cream sundae: Banana caramel and strawberry (with no artificial strawberry flavor) scoops were so creamy and had just the right amount of sweetness. The chocolate sauce wasn't too heavy and was a perfect complement to the ice cream. I'll be back soon to try the other fabulous sounding dishes on their menu.",1
5244,14,5,7/26/2014,"Awesome on all levels. mac-n-cheese, bucket of chicken, cornbread and watermelon were fantastic. The dining room is comfortable and the decor is super cute.

Â It was a rainy evening and the staff members were trying to figure out a way to keep the floors dry but they remained friendly, attentive and enthusiastic throughout - wonderful service. Â  Their fried chicken is fantastic (Tabasco honey is great with it). Â Also ordered grits (delicious), mac and cheese, cheddar cheese waffles, a sandwich (which I don't see on their menu anymore) and split a sundae/cookie for dessert. Â The space is decorated nicely and on the small side, but it looked like they managed to fit a lot of people in there. Â Looking at their updated menu, a few things have changed, so I can't wait to come back and try the rest of their food!",1

Â Our server was so friendly, made some really great suggestions, and seemed like he had everything under control despite the packed house. Â We started off with biscuits and the peach caprese. Â The biscuits were good and the peach caprese was interesting, but seemed like a very small serving. Â We then had the chicken and waffle sandwich with a side of waffle fries which were both amazing and very filling. Loved it, super charming and great service.",1
5247,14,4,7/25/2014,"we came here without a dinner reservation last night, told it was gonna be about 1 1/2 hour wait, we took a chance and put our name down. Â luckily, we were seated only 15 minutes later. Â so, don't get deterred by the wait time ppl, their estimates could be a bit off. Â :-) first off, i loved the decor, it's so cute, kitschy, and southern, from its painted white tables, to old-school china, and mason jar-like lights, everything oozes southern charm. Â it's a tiny restaurant, but ppl are friendly. Â our server was Emory and he was attentive but not intrusive. Â we went kinda crazy and ordered a bunch of stuff. Â :-) -biscuits: Â golden brown biscuits served with honey roasted chicken jus and salt, we were instructed to dip the biscuit in the chicken jus, then sprinkle the salt mixture on it. Â it was a tasty combo. -watermelon ham & cheese: Â sweet watermelon paired with sheep's milk cheese, crispy Virginia ham. Â another interesting combo of sweet, savory, and textures. Â it was very refreshing. -waffle fries: Â i gasped when i first tasted it, because it's like those chick-fil-a waffle fries, but even better! Â it's very crispy and well-seasoned (a bit too salty for my taste tho), the accompanying chunky remoulade was creamy and cooling. Â bonus point, chef mcinnis served it and explained the dish to us. Â cool guy! -mac & cheese: Â has a crispy crust with elbow pasta (cooked perfectly, a tad more cooked than al dente, but not a sloppy mush) and cheese sauce was very tasty. Â kinda sad that the staff forgot to pack it up for me when i asked for it to-go. Â  and now the finale... -crispy half bucket of chicken: Â we got 4 pieces of chicken (drumstick, wing, breast, and thigh). Â they were sweet tea brined, dusted with lemon, and served with spiked honey tabasco. Â tasty skin, but not super-crispy like some yelpers said. Â i got the wing and it was very very salty. Â the bf got the breast and it was very juicy and seasoned just right. Â i'm thinking maybe since it's a bigger piece of meat, therefore, it could withstand a whole night of brinning without tasting too salty. Â i still have the drumstick and thigh leftover, so i'll try it and maybe come back to update the other finale, dessert! -kitchen sink sundae: Â we had a choice of ice cream/toppings and i picked the caramelized banana ice cream, fresh peaches as topping. Â the peaches were not the sweetest or juiciest, so it wasn't too special. Â ice cream was creamy, not-too-sweet, and had a very concentrated caramelized banana flavor. Â  our server also recommended other desserts, carrot cake if you don't want something too sweet; coconut cake if you have a bigger sweet tooth. Â i overheard the next table's conversation and they raved about the beet sorbet. Â hmmm... Â interesting. it's been awhile since i've been excited about trying a new restaurant and R&B didn't disappoint. Â all the staff were attentive and helpful, always explained the dish when presenting it. Â while some dishes were too salty, but were more highs than lows. Â we had an excellent experience and recommends it to everyone. Â don't get deterred about the wait, it's wildly inaccurate to say the least. Â haha. Â go and enjoy yourself!",1

3707,14,3,7/23/2014,"Just so so. After hearing about the hype around this place because of Yardbird, I was really looking forward to coming asap. I arrived at around 10pm on a Saturday night and the wait was still an hour and a half. Good thing I wasn't hungry or I would've definitely left to go somewhere else real quick. All I really wanted to do was try the fried chicken so I decided to just order half the bird and have a taste while my bf can eat the rest. And that's what we did, it was ready in like 5 minutes. We took it outside right on their little bench and dug in. Honestly, I was pretty disappointed. Now, I'm not saying it was gross and disgusting or anything but the price is a little steep and it was nothing mind blowing. The batter was uneven and the flavors in the batter were just okay. And some of the pieces of chicken were pretty dry, which led us to go ask for some sauce and discovered the tobasco honey which saved the chicken even though it shouldn't need it. I don't know, I think I will give it another try one day so I can try the chicken and waffles and other items, but I won't come back in a hurry.",1
5250,14,3,7/20/2014,"Having been to Yardbird down in Miami, I knew I was going to have to visit this place when Jeff finally made his way up here to NY. The menu is pretty similar, fried chicken, waffles, biscuits, just a whole lot of good southern cooking. Â Unfortunately the food didn't quite stack up compared to Yardbird. Â Yeah the fried chicken and biscuits here are good, but something's missing, maybe a little more batter on the chicken is needed? Â The mac and cheese I remembered was really good the first few bites, but if it sits around for a couple of minutes the cheese really starts to stiffen up. Â On top of that, service was a little bit slow, okay, very slow. Â I'll chalk it up to them working out kinks, but I don't think that's an excuse since it's not the first time he's running a restaurant. With that being said, I'll definitely be back since I just can't say no to fried food...",1
5251,14,2,7/20/2014,"Small space commensurate with the vast majority of establishments in the (far) East Village. Â  Our group of four came here for dinner based on the accolades given to this chef duo's Miami restaurant, Yardbird. Â  The highlight of the experience was easily the service. Â Each and every member of the waitstaff was extremely friendly, outgoing and very attentive. However, the food, although good, just did not measure up to the hype. Â  The cornbread served with clotted cream and apricot preserves was dry and flat (literally and in taste) for a cornbread. Â The only thing saving it was the clotted cream accompaniment. The fried chicken was moist, but parts of the batter on certain pieces was soggy and the seasoning was lacking. Â Also, the batter to meat ratio skewed heavily towards over-battering. The accompanying waffles again were fine, but the melted cheddar cheese on top hardened almost immediately and was not very appetizing after sitting for five minutes. The deviled eggs were akin to those found at many a family BBQ. Â  The ricotta gundi was bland and served with too much sauce. The macaroni and cheese was second runner up for best food choice, which our group voted to be the waffle fries seasoned with fresh dill and accompanied by a whole grain mustard aioli with some underlying spice. Of course, as my husband pointed out, it's not hard to serve a good french fry....fried potatoes are inherently delicious....and if that's the best thing on the menu, maybe reevaluate the dining choice.",1
3356,14,3,7/20/2014,"From the ashes of Mama's Food Shop, what a fitting tribute. Loved Mama's for years when I could devour it's large plates. The stinky bathroom is in the same spot, and spotless now- no big spoon key needed. Roots and Bone has it's roots in Florida- from Yardbird to Swine, both of which I have eaten at. Roots and Bone is a hot restaurant. At 5:30 Saturday(yesterday) there was a crowd of 10 people waiting for it to reopen from brunch. Damn- buzz is good. Foodwise- this spot is pricey. Ate: Cornbread- $6 Blue crab rolled in apples with grapes & pecans- $10 Corn on husks with sweet popcorn & cornbread mayo- $7 Shrimp & grits- $19 Cornbread with clotted cream & preserves was good. Enjoyed the inventiveness of the crab in slender granny Smiths- good bite contrast plus grapes & crunchy pecans. Corn on husks was my fave- just a gorgeous dish. The shrimp & grits with it's ham, & pungent tomato flavor was packed with flava- shrimp were lake farmed not so tasty. The food here is good, and the waiter awesome, the buzz- very buzzy, but for local Southern- Bob White's, Bo's and my all time fave- The Dogwood(BK) will rock your Southern craving & make you slap yourself and scream for more.",1
5252,14,4,7/19/2014,"I visited Root & Bone this past Tuesday after reading about it in one of my many NYC emails! I am always intrigued by a fried chicken joint, so I knew I had to go. Unfortunately, similar to some of the reviews I'm seeing, I had a bad experience with the reservation. I called two weeks ago to make a reservation for that current week and was told that they were booked. I then made a reservation for the following week. Tuesday rolled around and I had not received a confirmation so I called them to confirm. No one picked up so I left a message. By that afternoon, I still hadn't received a call back, so I called again. I spoke with someone and told her my name time of the reservation and the # of people in the party. I said I was just calling to confirm and she said ""Yep"". Shame on me for taking this ""Yep"" as a ""yes, your reservation is confirmed"" Upon arrival I was told they did not have my reservation. At the same time a gentleman came out from the dining area with a raised voice about the confusion with seating for his party. He demanded that they move the people that they just put in his seats. Lastly, a person who came in right after me and allegedly had a reservation received the same response, that there was nothing on file for them either. I spoke with the manager and she was able to seat me and my guest at the bar in front of the kitchen within 20 minutes. Though I my chair was practically blocking the bathroom door. Luckily this did not become a disgusting situation but it certainly could have. Needless to say, they really need to work on their organization skills and their seating and reservation process. Okay, on to the good stuff! Both the food, and the speed at which is came out was fantastic and impressive given their other issues. We ordered the fried chicken (the whole bird), the cornbread, the waffles, and the mac and cheese. I have not a complaint about any of these foods, they were all excellent. The fried chicken was exactly as it is being described in other reviews, crispy and light but so juicy and delicious. I'm not a particular fan of dark meat so I would say that the legs were a little ""bleh"" but the chicken breasts were out of this world. The fried outside has a lemony thyme seasoning on it that is so refreshing. The cornbread which comes with a creamy spread and a rhubarb jam of some sort was also great. This came out first for us to nosh on. No complaints here. The waffles were 4 smaller but thick waffles covered in a slice of cheese (not sure what kind). They were accompanied by some kind of whiskey syrup that was really interesting and good. I didn't get too into the waffles because I had the corn bread. The mac and cheese was not warm enough when it came out, but they just sent it back for us and gave us a new one that was very hot. It was creamy but not too flavorful, I think this is okay given how the chicken really steals the show. It was topped with breadcrumbs which gave a nice crunch. Very thick and creamy. My friend ordered a Arnold Palmer but the waiter forgot about it. After she reminded him again he was more attentive and asked her if she wanted a refill. Overall I would say the food was delicious, the service worked out okay, and I would go back when they get their stuff together a bit more. I would like to try the dessert next time but we were too full! Please definitely go check them out if you love fried chicken, but you may want to wait a few more weeks until they settle.",1
5253,14,5,7/18/2014,"Went for brunch. Â Every bite of food was delicious. Â Was hard to decide between the cornbread or the biscuits, went with the biscuits with chicken jus and did not regret it. Â The fried chicken (thigh & leg) was the best I have had. I loved the Waffle Benedict. Shrimp & Grits were just as good as expected, since that is what I remember Jeffrey for most on Top Chef. I will definitely be going back for dinner. Getting to watch Janine and Jeffrey cook from our seats at the counter made the experience even better.",1
5254,14,4,7/18/2014,"I am a huge fan of Yardbird in Miami so I was really excited to try Root & Bone. Overall, I was very pleased with my experience. My friends and I shared the following: biscuits, 1/2 bucket of fried chicken, deviled eggs, mac and cheese, meat loaf, peach caprese salad and Mississippi mud for dessert. I also had the blackberry saddle cocktail. Favorites: the biscuits were sooo good, especially with the chicken jus, thyme and sea salt. I also loved the deviled eggs. So pretty to look at and even more delicious. Last but certainly not least, the fried chicken with spiked Tabasco honey is a must. Without the honey, the chicken is moist and flavorful but with the honey, it's on another level. The mac and cheese was good, especially the crust, but I wasn't blown away. Same for the peach caprese salad, though the pickled green tomato in the salad was phenomenal. The meat loaf, while tasty, was my least favorite but then again, I'm not a meat loaf person. I thought the dessert was a very interesting combination of flavors. My friends didn't like the beet sorbet but I really enjoyed it. And lastly, my cocktail was very well balanced and great for slow sipping. The restaurant itself is so cute and the service was great. I can't wait to return to try more items on the menu.",1
2198,14,3,7/17/2014,"Food I ate at yardbird in Miami and loved the food there so had to try this place when I found out the chef from yardbird opened this one in Ny...very disappointed relative to the one in Miami...this food was good but not great Fried chicken and waffles....there wasn't much flavor to it...the waffles tastes doughy and not a lot of flavor to it...the chicken the same, lack of flavor 1/2 fried chicken- chicken was crispy and moist but a little bit too much of the lime juice on it for my liking...the biscuit that came with it was ok...I normally don't like biscuits and had a bite to try,,,it was more moist than an average biscuit....but still not good enough for me to keep eating it or wow'd Service...I called and there weren't any reservations left but the person said as long as you come before 7 there should be tables...got there before 7 and the next available table for 4 was 3 hours later! So instead ordered the food and ate outside...after we finished the lady stood Â outside calling all the names on the list and everyone had already left!

5255,14,4,7/16/2014,"Came at 5:15 after reading done reviews and knowing that they were fully booked. I was the only one in sight lol. Anyway around 5:25 chef jeff let met in and was super kind and friendly, as was everyone else from the staff. First let me say that I don't love fried chicken. Not that I don't like it, it's just not something I usually order. However the chicken and waffle sandwich was amazing. So many different flavor combos going on. I can't wait to go back and try the bucket of fried chicken. The Mac and cheese was not my style. I felt the top was a little salty and the inside a little soupy. However the cornbread, which was delicious, paired with the Mac and cheese worked perfectly. The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the waffle fries. They were under done and the bacon on them didn't have much flavor. I was seriously stuffed after all this (yes, I shared a little) so I got a coconut cake to go. Of course as soon add I got home I needed to try it and it's lemony and coconuty and heavenly. Can't wait to go back and try the brunch!",1
5256,14,4,7/16/2014,"ROOT & BONE TRUMPS PIES 'N THIGHS IN MY BOOK. I was scared we weren't going to be able to get a table on a busy Monday night bc the hostess asked if we made reservations. However, they were able to seat us nevertheless! HALF BIRD (4pcs)--BEST FRIED CHICKEN I'VE HAD IN THE CITY. Definitely the STAR of our meal. It's hard to describe the taste but on their website it says ""SWEET TEA BRINED and PICKLED LEMON DUSTED"". Don't be scared by the light dusting of pickled lemon! It's different but adds a UNIQUE TWIST. The taste of the chicken is just SO UNIQUE and NOT LIKE ANY OTHER FRIED CHICKEN JOINT I've tried. The meat was so GODDAMN TENDER and JUICY and the skin didn't just flop off the meat. The SKIN was so DELICIOUS!! MUST GET MUST GET MUST GET and DIP IN THE TABASCO HONEY SAUCE OMG MAC 'N CHEESE--SOLID staple. They use CORKSCREW pasta and upon first bite, it's CREAMY, dry, and CRUNCHY (from the thyme crust). Cheesy but NOT BEYOND CHEESY. WAFFLE CUT FRENCH FRIES--Nice touch with the dill pickle salt. Could use a heavier hand on the seasoning though. ROOT--We probably could've DONE WITHOUT this side. The MEDLEY of VEGETABLES were soft and tasty but the pesto was just alright. The rice was undercooked and gave the already dry pesto a weird consistency. Decor was so adorable. Plant terrariums, dusty white woodwork, and white/light grey/earth colors gave the dining room a very rustic yet modern feel. Our server was an absolute darling. FYI MAKE A RESERVATION APPARENTLY",1
5257,14,2,7/16/2014,"My wife and I are huge fans of the owners having been to the Yardbird Miami restaurant they came from. Sadly the food was a great disappointment. We had been following the opening of Root and Bone for months because we loved the food at Yardbird, so I guess our expectations are a little high. Â  It's not that the food was bad. It was good. Not great or even very good. Just good. I got the fried chicken which had a breading that had no flavor and the chicken itself had no seasoning to it. The waffle fries were way over salted. As a matter of fact, since we were seated at the bar by the kitchen, we could see all the cooks who were constantly flinging salt on everything. Â My wife ordered the Chicken & waffle sliders which is big enough and dense enough for a meal for one person. The waffles were tasty enough and the chicken was okay. No complaints but no fireworks. Â We had started with the biscuits.. ""Everyone has to try the biscuits!"" our cook told us. Sadly, they were very dense and dry. Twice as much gravy would have helped. We also had the peach salad. that was just dull. Â Finally, there was the Meatloaf. I had ordered it to go when we ordered the rest because there were so many things I wanted to try. It looked great coming out of the kitchen but it was very dense when we ate it. just a half teaspoon of gravy on top that couldn't spread over the entire thing. Not enough vegetables on the side to justify the price. $21.00. Â There were other things we wanted to come back and try, until after we had the food and paid. Walking away, my wife turned to me and said ""We don't have to come back here. I kind of thought it would be like the other place. The food wasn't what I had hoped."" I agreed, especially since we ordered so many things and ran up a hefty bill. I'd say it was worth what we spent if it had been close to what we had expected. But it wasn't close. Not nearly. I have nothing scathing to say about the place. It's not a bad place.I wouldn't eat there again, but it's not bad. the service was fine, I guess, but the food was unspectacular. Fried chicken should have flavor. Not just salt. Food shouldn't be so dense. So far, the best fried chicken is Sidecar in Brooklyn. If it's chicken and Waffles you want, try Sweet Chick in Williamsburg. The only Meatloaf I know that is good is the Meatloaf Sliders at Backyard in Brooklyn. If you get a chance to go to Yardbird in Miami, you are in for a treat. Order the BLT made with fried green tomatoes and pork belly. yumyumyum",1
1967,14,4,7/15/2014,"I had been waiting for a while for Root & Bone to open, and I finally went with some friends. Twice in one weekend, actually. That might be a bit excessive, but who cares? I'm a big Top Chef fan, and I was eager to try a meal created and assembled by 2 Top Chef contestants, Jeff McInnis and Janine Booth. The decor reminds you of an old school Southern dining room, with little pockets of flowers strewn across the walls. The service was very attentive and friendly. We even got to chat it up a little bit with Jeff when we were there for brunch. Also, fact: Janine is a stone cold fox. I had the opportunity to try the biscuit basket with gravy, blue crab waldorf, bucket of bird, waffle and chicken sandwich, and the mac & cheese. The biscuits and gravy were very dense and had a great chew/texture to them, and the gravy was very great. The blue crab waldorf salad was very well done, and had the right amount of acidity from the apples and grapes. The bucket of bird was outrageously good. The fried, lemony skin was just unreal, and the meat was moist, tender and juicy. The mac and cheese was creamy and delicious, and the large buttered bread crumbs added a great crunch to the dish. The only dish that was a little disappointing was the chicken and waffle sandwich. The waffle was very soft, cold and had no crispiness to it, which is something I prefer. There was also no cheese on it which was really disappointing. We told Jeff and he was very apologetic, and he offered to make another batch, but we were already full. However, the green tomato was a great touch, and the fried chicken, as usual, was outstanding. In the first few months, Root & Bone has run out of reservations and won't be taking anymore for a while, so you probably shouldn't even try for now. Instead, you'll have to get there early and try to snag one of the seats at the counter, usually 11:15 for brunch on weekends, or at 5:15 for dinner. I think given the demand, they should just get rid of reservations altogether, but that's just my opinion. They also have a small shop, called Little Roort, adjacent to the restaurant that sells treats and fried chicken, if you aren't lucky enough to snag a reservation or a walk-in seat. I'll be back for that chicken. I highly recommend you sit at the counter if you get a chance, so you can see everything going on in the kitchen, and get a chance to talk to the chefs.",1
2438,14,4,7/14/2014,"2 hour wait for 2 ppl 6:30pm on a Friday night. Was seated within 45 minutes. Since it's a new restaurant, it has horrible reservation/table management. I came at 630 and I saw that the whole dining room was empty. was seated around 7 and still the whole dining ro was empty. Left around 8 and half the dining room was empty. I could see why some people who were waiting to be seated were frustrated. Now for the food - Not worth the hype, but good regardless. 4/5 for the Fried Chicken. I honestly came here purely for the chicken. Skin wasn't crispy for some reason (it was soggy), which was awful, but the meat was flavorful and the skin was delicious. But I wouldn't come back for it. Clinton st bakery has better fried chicken. 4.5/5 for waffles. A little salty but man was it good. Melted cheese and delicious waffle. Small hut jam packed with flavor. Other dishes are not worth ordering. I don't remember the name of the salad but it wasn't good. Blue crab appetizer was whatever. They're tiny and are nothing compared to what I saw online. Tasted whatever. Lamb special wasn't good either. Boring old meat It should be a 3.5 stars but I like their effort - new twist on southern cooking.",1
5258,14,4,7/14/2014,"Went here for brunch last weekend. The space is beautifully decorated and our waitress told us it was all DIY by the staff (impressive!). We got a basket of fried chicken (a whole bird is WAY too much for two people), the cheddar waffles (tasty but which they were crispier on the outside), salad, and the deviled eggs (delish). My one constructive point is that the hot sauce and maple syrup shouldn't be premixed together. Not everyone likes that much sugar on their chicken! The bloody mary was good but all bloody marys should have accoutrements, even if it's just a stalk of celery.",1
5259,14,4,7/13/2014,They have very tasty fried chicken! Cheese waffles are delicious too :),1
5260,14,5,7/11/2014,"Aside from all of the hype on the food blogs and such, I knew I had to come here once I heard it was from the same chef that runs the amazing Yardbird in Miami, where I had an unforgettable meal a few years ago. Even with these high expectations, I was not disappointed at all, and ended up having yet another incredible meal from Jeff McInnis. I knew we were in for a good time when we got the warning from our friendly waitress that we ordered way too much food, which we went ahead with anyway: - Southern Style Cornbread ($6) This was great, and the beginning of the deliciously salty foods that dominated the meal. The 4 squares of soft, fluffy cornbread were topped with coarse salt, and served alongside clotted cream and beet jam. Much moister and less crumbly than typical cornbread, this was a great choice to start and was delicious along with the very different beet flavor from the jam. - Fried Chicken & Waffle Sandwich ($14 for 2) This is the thing everybody seems to be talking about and Instagramming here, but it actually wasn't as good as the rest of the stuff. It is a beautiful little sandwich, impressively tall and very nicely presented, and is quite delicious, but if you are going to eat fried chicken, you should stick to the regular entree one instead. This one has a juicy piece of dark meat, a thick cut green tomato, and really soft, fluffy waffles as the bread. It's definitely still worth trying, but there's so much other great stuff that may be better. - Mac & Cheese ($7) This was a really excellent, cheesy bowl of piping hot Mac & Cheese. The crumbled cheese toast and thyme crust on top added a very nice crunch to the gooey, large noodles. This is a definite must as a side dish. - Waffle Cut French Fries ($5) with Gooey Cheese Sauce & Bacon ($1) Yet another must from this can't miss menu, these were incredible. As if waffle fries weren't awesome enough, you just have to pay a measly dollar bone to get some delicious ""gooey cheese sauce"" and bacon to top it all off. I sometimes balk at this option, as a sloppy drizzling of cheese can render the whole batch of fries soggy and unrecognizable, but it was done very sparingly and perfectly here. They actually went with even more bacon than I expected, which was a welcome addition, making this possibly an even better side than the Mac & Cheese. - Braised Short Rib Meat Loaf ($21) This was awesome. Not really a meat loaf so much as it was two giant slabs of ridiculously soft short rib, it was actually not even expensive given how much quality meat you get. This is one of their popular entrees and it's really easy to see why. - Crispy Free Range Bucket of Bird ($16 for half a bird) I know I said a lot of stuff here is a must, but this is what you truly must order here, otherwise you will have failed miserably and you should go right back for another meal. Our waitress actually used to work at Yardbird in Miami, and told us the fried chicken here was even better than the good stuff at his first restaurant, and she was completely right. This was truly some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. The skin was impossibly moist and crispy at the same time, and was so incredibly packed with flavor from the lemon seasoning and brine. You get 4 pieces: a breast, a thigh, a wing and a drumstick. I usually only really like white the most, but all of these pieces were addictive. Too good. - Mississippi Mud Pie with Beet Gelato ($9) We went with 2 of the 3 available desserts, and both were just as good as all of the food we just stuffed ourselves with. This little slice of mud pie packed so much flavor and richness. It was incredibly chocolatey and dense and went very well with the refreshing beet gelato. - Parsnip Carrot Cake ($9) This one may have been even better than the mud pie. The delicious Maple Ice Cream and the cake were a perfect combo. The cake was really sweet, with dense cake and a delicious creamy frosting layer in between and on top. It's hard to choose as both desserts were excellent. Be warned - they pretty much aren't accepting any walk-ins, other than for the few counter seats against the windows and a few seats by the bar in the small back room. I called and they said they were booked solid for dinner for the entire month of July, and even when we got there a few minutes after opening at 5:30 PM, we were just barely able to snag the last two seats at the bar. They also have a little spot to the left of the entrance called Little Root, which offers some of their menu for takeout, as well as drinks and some sweets, including cakes and Chocolate Chip Cookies and Rice Krispie Treats ($2 each). The cookie and treat weren't great, so stick to the cakes for a good dessert if you want something to go. Make reservations now or get there early to grab a counter seat - you will not be disappointed and will be lucky to try some of the best fried chicken ever and one of the best new restaurants of the yea",1
5261,14,5,7/11/2014,"I've never had better fried chicken. It's cooked to perfect, but how it's seasoned, through-and-through, is what really wins me over most. The sweet tea brine gives it a particular herbaceousness that accentuates but never interferes with the meat, and the lemon dusting on the skin is really what puts it over the top in awesomeness. Zesty, sumptuous, mouth-wateringly addictive. It's not cheap, but it's worth the cost. It's not close to my apartment, but it's worth the trek. I've been twice already this week, and am already planning my next visit. Also terrific are the waffles and deviled eggs and macaroni & cheese and grilled corn. In addition to the awesome food, the staff are incredibly attentive and friendly. Overall, Root & Bone has a whole lot to recommend!",1
5262,14,5,7/10/2014,"Went over again for takeout this week. Jeff was as sweet as can be and again, the food was AMAZING. The girl at the counter was very nice and I will recommend this place to everyone I know. Had the biscuits this time around and they were sooooooooo good. The banana cream pie in a jar was really a treat.",1
5263,14,5,7/10/2014,"Created a yelp account just so I could write about Root & Bone-one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. The staff was incredibly gracious. The chef Jeff (top chef contestant) stops to talk to us, thanking us for coming by and asking for feedback while his partner Janine (also a TC contestant) stops her work in the kitchen every time a customer wants to say hi. Rest of staff constantly smiling and offering recommendations. As for the food, one of the rare occasions where everything ordered off the menu is SO on point. We started with shrimp and grits: amazing with a healthy portion of shrimp. Must try for those that haven't had shrimp & grits (or those that have and love them). The fried pimento cheese/basil/green tomato/grilled peach salad was creative and refreshing. And then... THE FRIED CHICKEN. Brined in sweet tea with dehydrated lemons infused into the skin. What. Do not come here and skip on this. Simply...mind blowing. Chef Jeff informs us this is Chef Janine's genius creation. Never had anything like it and woke up this morning wanting more. Side of cheese waffles (yes please) and some banana pudding like thing for dessert, also amazing. Cannot wait to go back. Dying to try everything else on the menu and, of course, get more of their fried chicken. Southern hospitality and cuisine at its finest (and this is coming from a southerner). You'll forget you're in New York.",1
5264,14,4,7/9/2014,"Hubs & I THOROUGHLY enjoyed this High Class, Simplistic approach to Southern fare. I HATE lamb but ate almost ALL of my hubs grilled lamb dish. It was marinated to tender, juicy charred perfection. The Grilled Corn Appetizer is TO DIE 4! I swipe-licked the sweet butter off the plate w my fingers. I would've done like I do at home but didnt want to embarrass the hubs any further. The Small Plates are ""exactly"" that, small, almost miniscule but delish! Blue Crab Waldorf (ode to my granny) is a great lite starter...again, I needed/wanted MUCH more! My entree was actually the Chicken & Waffle Sandwich. Good (needed more seasoning) but the other dishes were better. We had NO room for dessert but WILL be returning soon & eating dessert 1st! Drinks compliment this Bourbon-Whisky laced place. Hub's Blackberry & Bourbon was AMAZING. I had both Chenin Blanc (Cali, im usually partial to France) & the Sauvignon-Blanc-Aussie (surprisingly delish, im usually a NZ SNOB!) In the end, a Chaise Lounge & Personal Trainer is needed with each reservation! EXCELLENT! Â We'll definitely be returning, bringing family & friends & highly recommending! Tight quarters but we'll make it work. Chefs Jeff & Janine, are EXTREMELY friendly & engaging WITHOUT losing focus on the star-the dishes! Their staff, especially host Kate is highly attentive & accomodating! Other servers quickly saw to our needs when our server was busy. Extra Bonus: CLEAN Bathrooms! (We ALWAYS check out 1st & leave when this is a problem! Can't stand a nasty bathroom!)",1

Â Everything was amazing!! Â I think my friend is still mad at me that we didn't try the waffles. Â I highly recommend this restaurant but make a reservation because it has only been open for a week and it was already packed!",1
5266,14,4,7/7/2014,"The place just opened for business very recently, and they were serving the brunch menu all day when we arrived in the evening. My friend ordered the first drink on the cocktail menu (something with bourbon and Swedish punsch), and it was delicious. They have about six really good beers on tap, too. Â The iced tea was watery. Â Oh right, the food. It was...fine. It's the latest of a lot of Southern-inspired places. I found the waffles a little too spongy. I can see how one yelper said they were soggy when he got take-out. They arrive very steamy and puffy at the table; I don't imagine they travel well. Next time, I'm gonna try the mac&cheese, which looked amazing. Â They had 2 salads on the menu, and we got one of each. Delicious, but not big enough to share. The sweet tea-brined chicken was indeed very good, but it won't change your life. It comes with a honey-Tabasco combo you can dip it in. Â  The dessert menu sounded great, but 2/3 Â of our party wanted to go elsewhere. Â  The place is very small, maybe 1000 sq ft. The clientele tended toward the young and good-looking. We would def be willing to go back, but I fear it will soon become hugely popular and impossible to get into.",1
5267,14,5,7/7/2014,"Hands-down, this was the best southern-inspired meal I've had in this great city. Food-wise: the biscuits, which you dip in a chicken jus and sprinkle with sesame seeds and salt, and the cornbread, which comes with honey butter and jam, are outrageously delicious. The fried chicken, which I was concerned about being too heavy for consumption on a warm summer day, is beyond-words-insane--not at all heavy, served with a super tasty hot sauce. The waffles are cooked to perfection, and the whiskey maple syrup is the perfect accompaniment. The service from our waiters was somewhat spotty, but was ultimately redeemed when a friend of the proprietors' brought out the food and explained what each dish was. They clearly take a lot of pride in their dishes and food, and offer a nice familial ambience...we were there on the weekend during the early dinner rush, and the place had families coming in and out. The feeling of family was felt even moreso when I watched a really nice exchange between one of the proprietors, who was in the kitchen, come out and embrace a friend who had come to offer her congratulations. It's clear that their hard work has paid off. This place is a winner. Highly recommend!",1
5268,14,5,7/7/2014,"I took my family to Root and Bone yesterday and truly enjoyed every aspect of our experience. We sat at the bar and watched Jeff and Janine put beautiful creations together. It's so important to have great chemistry and flow in an operation and these two have it. I ordered just about everything on the menu and was really impressed with the flavors, presentation and execution of everything. We ordered the fried chicken which was beautifully brined, crispy and bright. The lemon flavors throughout every crispy bite was very refreshing and kept you wanting more. The Peach Caprese was very thoughtful and delicious. I love the play on a Classic Italian salad that was turned southern by the pickled green tomato slice complimented by the beautifully dressed greens and Pimento Cheese Fritter. Next the watermelon cheese and ham. #Ridiculous. Mac n Cheese #money. Deviled Eggs were gorgeous. 3 perfect little bites with a little purple color from beet juice made this not only eye appealing but the flavors were stunning. The crispy waffles with Cheddar and Maple Hot Sauce were awesome. What can I saw about the Meatloaf other than this is perfect for the Gluten Allergic folks due to the method that it's made. Perfectly cooked short ribs, shredded, seasoned then seared until crispy paired with parsnip purÃ©e, roasted heirloom carrots, grilled onions and tomato ketchup jam. #omg #amazing. Shrimp and grits were heavenly. Coarse ground local grits perfectly cooked the only way a southerner would know how to cook them. #lotsoflove. The shrimp were perfectly cooked by Janine personally and seasoned to perfection. I enjoyed seeing her kill it on last chance kitchen of Top Chef New Orleans. Every bit of care, love and passion was tasted in every bite. Now on to desserts. Carrot Parsnip Cake was perfectly moist with a slight twang from the cream cheese icing. The banana cream pie served in the little mason jar was just awesome. Then the Everything but the kitchen sink Sundae was just stupid good. Little bites of yum was carefully crafted. This was simple an amazing start for Root & Bone. I loved the decor of the entire space. Old with the new. Old fashioned plates reminded me of my Grandmothers house in St Augustine with flavors to match from the old south. Even the expo window with the old fashioned letter holder was a nice touch. Â #FirstClass.",1
5269,14,4,7/6/2014,"Fantastic. Â I had the grits and shrimp and sidw bacon. Â My husband the chicken and waffle sandwich. Â Started with refreshing cocktail, finished with rich Porter and coconut pie and for him, Â carrot cake. Â Our waitress was delightful and knowing. I think they may have been trying out someone new, Â he has a bit of a learning curve. The spot is pretty tiny. Sitting bar style in front of the open, Â street window enabled fun people watching.",1
5270,14,4,7/5/2014,"After only being open one week, this is only going to get hotter. Â The attention to quality is evident in the only brunch menu. Â The fried chicken on the cheese-waffle is delicious and bountiful. Â The waffle french fries with dipping sauce just tasty as all out. Â The BLT with pickled green tomato is one thick piece of well cooked bacon and the grilled peach salad with fried pimento cheese, tossed with frisee and grape tomatoes is a very nice salad. Â Good ice tea. Â Can't wait till the full menu opens up. Â Did not mention this yet, but the whole staff is very nice and the chef Jeff McGinness is a welcome addition to NYC.",1
2690,14,4,7/3/2014,"Root and Bone - the name of the restaurant alludes to fresh produce and meat and that's exactly what is offered in their dishes. Add in a dash of creativity, lovely Southern charm, and the work of two former Top Chef contestants, and you have yourself quite a winning restaurant. The interior looks a bit like an open cottage with muted grays and browns; splashes of color can be found in the hanging terrariums, tiny flowers on the wall, mismatched plates at each table, and in the food itself. The larger room even has a large china cabinet and it's exactly that cozy, open feel that really brings out the restaurant's farm-to-table quality. The fried chicken n' waffle sandwich (named ""Avenue A"" on the lunch menu) was really quite divine. Two small round sandwiches came per order, and the buns were replaced with soft cheddar waffles. I was expecting a bit of a crisp edge to the waffles, but they were instead soft; they surprisingly held the large chunks of fried chicken well. The chicken pieces were prepared in a maple whiskey brine and were SO juicy. The bright pickled green tomato slices and bits of watercress were nice accents and balanced out the sandwiches, preventing them from becoming overbearingly sweet and heavy. The jazzed (tarred??...the menu's font was hard to read) feathered fried chicken sandwich (named ""Avenue B"" on the lunch menu) had the same juicy fried chicken, but it was spiked with Tabasco for a real kick. The sandwich also came with bacon, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and potato rolls, but the greatest part was the buttermilk ranch sauce. Or so I'm told. J liked this sandwich so much that he devoured it before I could steal a bite. We also ordered a side of Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits (gosh, look at that name!) which were served with honey butter and peach preserves. Three squarish biscuits came per order. The spreads were good, but the biscuits themselves were a bit dry. This was the only negative note from the meal. Â  Root and Bone also offers twelve different cocktails and a wine list that leans toward American and Australian wines. If all of the cocktails sound great, it's most likely because they are. If you have difficulty picking, try the Filthy Manahttan! The ratio of whiskey, port, and bitters was fantastic. The amarena cherries left at the bottom of the glass were so boozily decadent. Likelihood of another visit: There are so many other menu items I'd love to try: peach caprese, the ""BLT that will tickle you pickle"", the short rib meatloaf, and the waffle benedict to name a few. There is an adjacent market, the Little Root Market, that sells its buckets of fried chicken and sandwiches to go and I think it's a convenient stop for a quick lunch if you're in Alphabet City.",1
5271,14,4,7/2/2014,"Will update this review once I get a chance to eat at the restaurant. Had some carryout today and it was delicious. Fried chicken waffle sandwiches were quite good, with flavorful chicken and just enough sweetness from the maple syrup. Mac & Cheese was also great, super cheesy and had a nice crunch from the breadcrumbs. Only reason I am not giving 5 stars is the fact that I arrived right when they said my food would be ready, but the waffles were already a tad soggy.",1
5272,14,5,7/1/2014,EXCELLENT southern food in alphabet city! Had an exceptional lunch today with fried chicken and biscuits. The honey was my favorite part of dish with an added kick of spice - but just the right amount to garnish the biscuit. Well priced and served the correct portion. Literally finger licking good,1
5273,15,1,10/11/2014,"Extremely slow service and least choices. Â  If you don't have 35 minutes extra wait time you better not get the coffee from here. Â The business is not capable handling high volume customers, Â it could be the size of the coffee maker machine they are using.",-1
5274,15,1,8/16/2014,"Can't wait for the fad to dissipate! For a few weeks, Two Hands was a place where you could calmly read your morning paper while enjoying a cup of coffee. Victim of its success, the place is now cashing in on a crowd desperate to get a seat to quickly (they'll kick you out after a while) ingurgitate the (pricey) food. Too bad, the whitewashed design (successfully borrowed from Happy Bones and Dimes) and the nice vintage touches (Stanley&Sons aprons, Mason jars) made it appear like a good neighborhood coffee shop.",-1
5275,15,2,9/27/2014,"The avo toast was delicious and the actual place looks cool and has lots of stuff like playing cards for table numbers which makes it stand out but unfortunately that's all it has. The hot chocolate and latte was nothing special and the food was ok but it's the service that let's this place down. The wait staff seem to be more interested in being cool rather than delivering excellent service. Our order was mucked up three times and in the end we just gave up. This place looks awesome and has a really cool vibe, just needs some work on the service.",-1
5276,15,5,11/1/2014,"We went here Friday late morning. It was busy! The seating is great and after ordering I found something considerably easy and comfy - the space and set up is brilliant and flows well. The banana bread was yummy and fresh and the almond croissant was good too. Their lattes are fantastic and creamy with a perfect balance. They even catered for my little lovely when I asked for a babyccino. Everyone is so so friendly, happy, considerate, warm and welcoming - especially while it was super busy with people coming and going non-stop. Highly recommend!",-1
5277,15,5,7/12/2014,"Best acai bowl in New York! I stumbled into Two Hands off the street looking for a quick coffee and ended up staying a couple of hours. I'm not sure if it was the big smile on the barrister's face or if the coffee actually tasted like heaven in a cup. Either way, I now have a new coffee spot in lower manhattan. Definitely worth a visit. If the chilled atmosphere doesn't take you away then the food will.",-1
5278,15,4,1/6/2015,"I think I've found my new favorite coffee shop in NYC. *_* Growing up in this city, with a self-proclaimed deep coffee obsession, I readily admit it lacks in cafe culture and this place serves it right up. Maybe it's because it's Aussie owned (I've heard great things about the cafes down under), with menu items like avo-toast and flat-whites. The overall airy, bright decor is refreshing to the rustic, dark feel that most cafes in New York have. Modern art, hanging bulb lights, wooden tables, and acai bowls make it look like it's straight from your Instagram feed. But the REAL reason for 4 stars? Probably the bomb almond-milk latte, made decadently with perfect latte art. Arguably the best latte I've had in a long time. The space is utilized well in terms of seats, but it does tend to get crowded. However, I've been able to snag a table easily both times I've been. Unfortunately, there's no free Wi-Fi, but nonetheless a great place to catch up with a friend.",1
5114,15,4,1/3/2015,"Delicious- they use califia almond milk as well, and the espresso is expertly pulled- no burnt shots here. The avo toast is delicious- the bread pulls apart easily and is some sort of multi-grain or wheat mix. We chose to top ours with a fried egg (#yolkporn) and they did the honors of dusting the dish with red pepper chili flakes. Win all around. The seating is a bit hunger games-esque because there isn't a lot of it, but this spot is hot. However, as they are moving to tableside and seating service, this issue should be worked out nicely.",1
5279,15,4,1/2/2015,This cafe is so cute and I love everything about it. In love with their cappuccino. The only thing is that it's always so crowed. But I would definitely come back!,1
5280,15,2,12/31/2014,it's very close to my building but i stopped coming after a few times cause the crowd was just too much and it took them 20' to make my to go latte. it's just not worth it.,1
5281,15,5,12/30/2014,Such great coffee and an amazing atmosphere. The food is basic but good. Really reminded a Sydney girl of home.,1
5282,15,4,12/29/2014,"So Aussie, so hipster, so crowded. The drink isn't bad and the avocado toast is good. It is still a bit more expensive than I'd like but it was overall an enjoyable meal. I just wish the benches at the communal table weren't so unstable. I felt like I was going to fall off whenever someone else got up and felt every move and shake. It's a cute place though definitely.",1
5283,15,2,12/29/2014,"Food and coffee are great. However, the unorganized chaos inside gets old and the staff isn't great. They're slow, not nice, and they are unsanitary. I saw one of the employees eating over a food preparation area.. Then didn't wash her hands after.",1
5284,15,4,12/28/2014,Very nice environment. Everything is cute in the store. Tried the smoothie and it was special and good. Would like to try the granola bowl next time.,1

Great drip coffee and girlfriend reported good latte (like back home in Australia). Somewhat limited breakfast menu but you can add chorizo and bacon to things. Good quality food otherwise though.",1
5286,15,4,12/22/2014,"I really like Two Hands. I was gonna get coffee until I saw they had mill shakes, so I decided to try the banana milk shake. The guy helping me suggested a bit of a twist that he recently had made with the milk shake by putting some coffee in it, and something else I think, which I can't remember. But it was soooo good! It had me wishing the cup was larger! I had a sandwich also. I don't remember what it was but I do remember that it was good and left me wanting more. The staff is super helpful and really nice too! We've gone back a couple of times whenever we're in the city, since we're not there too often. But if we are, this is definitely a spot to go to!",1

This is also a very cute place with plenty of seats and hipsters. haha The coffee is good and they bring it to you so the latte art isn't ruined. If you like coffee, take it seriously and enjoy latte art this is the place for you. Besides, most Aussie coffeeshops that have avocado toast on the menu have a place in my heart.",1

I love the atmosphere, and the staff is right on par. they are wicked awesome and create this laid back, chilled feeling. It was nice to come here and catch up with a friend over coffee and baked goods. I tried the almond croissant - PERFECT.. and of course my favorite drink is their latte. Â I must say though that the prices are a bit expensive but you get what you pay for plus good service. The avocado toast is just okay. It's $7 for just the avocado toast and if you want to add things, you need to pay for each topping. I say give it a try anyway, but don't expect to have it everyday for lunch or your pockets will be emptied! Do come as a regular though for their coffee... and perhaps some sweet eyes for those awesome Aussies. I guarantee you'll leave with a smile :)",1

Â With me being a loser, i assumed that they were toppings that came with the toast, I mean why would one slice of bread be $7 right? HAh. Â I am so dumb. Â I asked if I could get the roasted tomatoes and the egg on it along with a cappuccino -- it came up to $16. I was like.. whoa whoa whoa WHAT? $16 for a piece of bread and a capp? The toppings were $3 each. Â The egg was $3.. The EGG was $3...I can buy case of eggs at that price. Â What magical sprinkles are you putting on my egg? This is breakfast..not dinner. Â Wow. Â I quickly only ordered the egg only and it still came up to $13. Â Nah man I don't live this lifestyle. Â I usually don't even eat breakfast. Â That will only be a special case...Will come back for the cappuccinos though. Â Delicious. Â The bread I think was whole grain -- the crust I didn't enjoy because it was so tough to cut and chew.

My friend Jason and I always come and have a cup of coffee after lunch in chinatown during weekends. Pros? - Good Coffee!! Duh!! - only use whole milk (that's what makes it good) - for vegans, you can add 50 cents for almond milk Cons? - use only whole milk.. (you can't choose skim milk which I usually don't like my coffee to be too milky or creamy) - slow.. I guess they spend their time brewing and make a good coffee art for you Stop by for a coffee break..",1

Others have commented it was pricey: sure, but you're in a hipster coffee shop in NYC! Minor comment was that it was too cold inside (this was summer, with AC blasting) for me to sit and enjoy properly. The staff were really nice.

5296,15,3,11/4/2014,"This is one of those great little finds in the middle of Little Italy/Chinatown. Â I'm a local and love a good breakfast place that I can eat at once or twice a week. The food is excellent and reasonably priced for the area. The reason why am not giving it five stars is that the service was so painful this morning that it nearly ruined my appetite. Â  I walked up to the counter to order and the gentleman standing there, a blonde Australian guy, Â said to me ""can you hold on a second."" Â I said ""sure."" ...And then to my surprise right in front of me on the counter he was pulling his one dollar tips from the jar. Â  Five one dollar bills at a time and replacing it with a five dollar bill. Â Then he did it again and again till there was 4 five dollar bills at the top of the tip jar. Â I found it a bit strange or shall say I poor taste, but I thought okay.... maybe finally has a chance to do that. Â  I sat down and waited for my breakfast and notice three or four tables were piled high with dirty empty plates. One of them even had a tip on the table. Â I did see the sign ""bus your own table"" but not everybody follows that and the sign is ONLY in the back. Â Meanwhile the entire restaurant has dirty tables all over the place. Â Customers we're coming in and wanting to sit down but there was dirty tables everywhere. Â Even the table I was at was super sticky. Â  Then when my amazing food showed up and the same blonde Ozzie said ""do you need anything else""? Â I looked in the little silver bucket on the table and said ""there's no fork here"" and he said ""oh you can get it over there."" Â  I cannot believe how lazy this person is! Â  Half the tables are missing them. Â  It's a service business and he works for tips! Â What a joke! It put a bad taste in my mouth. Â Then I asked the guy across the table from me ""is it just me or is the service here really bad."" Â  He said, ""I had the same experience with silverware."" Â  I walked up to the counter and said ""the knife table in the bucket is dirty."" Â Response he got was ""you can get a new knife over there."" Â I've waitress for 10 years. Â My response would've been ""oh my gosh I'm so sorry "" and walked 3 feet to hand a new knife. Now I'm willing to come back here because I'm a local and love Two Hands food. Â Maybe the manager or the owner had a talk with the staff or got a new staff. Â I hate to blame one or two bad experiences cause of one or two poorly hired choices. Â One more time Two Hands And if I have another bad experience service I'll bring my breakfast appetite elsewhere.",1
5297,15,5,11/3/2014,"This place is great! I had an avocado toast with an egg and an iced tea and it was delicious. A lot of the negative reviews say the vibe is too hipster-y and it's crowded, and both of those things are true. The decor is right off of somebody's pinterest board and it's hard to get a table, but I like the atmosphere and I don't mind that it's busy. Personally, I don't think you should give a place 1 star for the fact that it attracts ""hipsters"" and you want your coffee hot and black and to go because you're from New York and you don't have time for this!!! It's a really cute place and the guys behind the counter are really friendly and accommodating (they saw my dslr and assumed I was there to take pictures for my blog and instructed the cooks to make my food extra pretty and told me how to arrange it) (to clarify I actually just had my camera because I was walking around soho but it was very nice of them) and the food was amazing, which, let's be honest here, is the main factor that goes into a food place for me.",1

Wait for said toast tops 30 min and will also set you back 7$. Note, we are in Chinatown where you can get a full meal for that price. For two. And it will be delicious. And your wait time is no wait bc it's a business. Â  All would've been tolerable but what I had to go was just ok. The croissant was soft. Â The latte was light. Flies were landing on the sandwiches. The wait and the lines are for ambiance. This place cultivates a stylish crowd. I no longer have the patience for following an ambiance, if what I am purchasing is inferior.

The service was fantastic and the staff was friendly and cheery! The avocado toast with bacon was delicious although that bread was a bit difficult to cut and the acai bowl was also very delicious. However, what I loved most was the cold brew. So refreshing without that awful after taste.

Def will come back.",1

I have also spent a great deal of time living in Sydney and was hoping for a great cappuccino or flat white. No matter how good the coffee may be, or how pretty the granola and yogurt is arranged, or how beautifully smashed that avocado is on the 7-grain-whole-wheat-rye-raw toast, right off I rolled my eyes to see that they don't serve skim milk. But they DO serve almond and soy. Why? It's certainly not ""Australian"" to do that...every cafe in Sydney serves skim milk. Its snobby. It is also ignorant because no one drinks full fat MILK anymore...its 2014 guys....fat, skinny, healthy, or not, NO adult in modern day America drinks whole milk. CHILDREN drink whole milk. So if you open up a cafe (in Nolita of all places), just make your clients happy and offer skim milk. All the skinny pretty girls you're serving? They want skim too! (Oh and guess what...its even cheaper than the soy and almond you're either buying or hand-making)",1
5304,15,4,10/13/2014,"I have been here numerous times, by myself, with a friend and with my sister. I have had their coffee, smoothie, fresh juice, avocado toast and bagel. Frankly, I loved all of them. Yes I have read some negative reviews about this place has been a hot mess, someone have complained about over crowded, people came here just to take photos, it took long time until their food arrived ect. I agree with them, but I guess that's the reason people were attracted to Two hands because of their cool vibe, delicious food( I don't think they over charged for coffee, latte or other beverages it is reasonable) unique decor (wood tables, photography, mason jaw, outdoor seatings, plants)and hot people. It doesn't matter what other says, your own experiences and opinions in this cafe matters. I have to admitted that it's always crowded in here, I was here on Sunday, I barely find the seats, all the seats were occupied. So I had to asked my sister to get the seats while I was ordering food. And as other said it took awhile until your food arrived, I had to waited for my juice, avocado toast and my sister's latte, they all arrived separately. Because they were so busy people continued to came in, I noticed that most people were waiting for their food, the staff behind the counter were working so hard to managing the situation. They were nice and keep things moving in order to satisfied what customers need. At the same time, they had to removed the dirty plates from the table and replaced the new silverware. We did not complain at all, people should have known that weekend it's always busy, especially in New York City. Other than that, I think maybe they should hire more staff to help clean the table and dishes. As some people mentioned that they should have wifi in here. I personally like this place so you better deal with it. If not you loss!",1

Well, except maybe the prices but we're in downtown Manhattan--at this point I know what to expect. I tried to avo toast and the ricotta toast and both were lovely. The quality of the toast was supurb and both were seasoned just right. Obviously, the ambience is quite nice--good looking people and a light, airy space which is sometimes hard to find in this part of town. All in all, I found myself wanting to return on a less busy day and plop myself down with a coffee and a book.",1
5306,15,3,10/11/2014,"The interior was nice. Price for the coffees was reasonable, in my opinion, since the coffee was actually good. I went with my brother and he got a ""shake"", but his ""shake"" barely had ice on it. The stool that i was sitting on was squeaky. The acai bowl was good, but really pricey.",1
5307,15,4,10/9/2014,"Someone cloned all the hot 20-something girls from GIRLS and deposited them at 3pm at any given day of the week. Â Where did they all come from? What do they do for a living? Why are they all wearing All Saints/Rag and Bone current season? Aloof coffee from Aussie surfers and solid bites & Coffee, ugly people take it to go.",1
5308,15,3,10/8/2014,"Coffee is good but let's not joke, you're not going here for that. You're going here for the 10/10 people that walk through the doors here, for the beautiful instagram/pinterest friendly vibes (succulents. wood tables. mason jars. avocado toast. huge windows. hot people), and for saying that you went here! try the avocado toast. its so messy to eat and really hard to cut but it is darn tasty. Acai bowls are 2.5/5. i make better ones myself. but the almond milk lattes are great. its cuz they use califia farms barista blend, which i figured out so now i can make the same thing at home and save myself $50 a week (each latte is like 5.50) back to the instagram thing, its almost annoying how many people come here just to say they came here. I'm in the food industry and work unsocial media, but its almost as if people aren't even chatting to each other when they come here, they just take pictures and scroll through their feeds in silence, editing their aerial foodstagrams. also they won't get wifi because they want people to talk to one another.

3429,15,2,10/5/2014,"OMG Two Hands was a hot mess today. It was crowded but not overly crowded--if it had been truly bad we would have left but in minutes we got a table so it seemed like it made sense to stay and order. Â Little did we know how long we would wait for our food, not to mention water, coffee or even utensils. We ordered the avocado toast with a fried egg on top, and my boyfriend added chorizo to his. Â We also split a croissant and I asked for drip coffee. Â They were out of drip but they gave me the dregs in a paper cup for free. Â I was so thirsty that I barely drank my coffee though. Â I asked for a cup of tap water and the man at the cash register said that he'd refill the communal water urn soon--it took like 45 minutes ti get refilled. Â In the meantime, we ate our croissant which was very tasty, but had been microwaved or something to be heated, because although you could tell it was a good croissant, it was super chewy. When our toast arrived (45 minutes later) it looked very tasty but they couldn't seem to locate any clean silverware, so our waitress brought us plastic take out utensils. Â As others have noted, the crust on the bread is extremely thick and crunch--delicious, but hard to eat when you only have a flimsy plastic knife. I do have to add that this was a great spot for people watching--it was a very Soho crowd and lots of people instagramming their avocado toast. Â I would go back but only if it was truly empty, it seems like that would be the best way to get food/forks/water when you need it.",1
5310,15,5,10/2/2014,Atmosphere: I absolutely loved the decor. It was really artsy and hipster. I really loved the pictures on the wall. Like even the bathroom was artsy. Food/Drink: Phenomenal. I ordered the ice coffee with a almond croissant for a total of $7 exact. The ice coffee came in a little cute mason jar and it tasted great. The almond croissant must be the best I ever had. So flaky & the taste was great. Service: The workers were sooo friendly. It was nice to have them bring me the coffee and croissant. I definitely recommend this place to coffee lovers.,1
5311,15,2,9/29/2014,Ok coffee. What coffee shop in NYC doesn't have skim milk or wifi though? Had the avo toast which was nice.,1
5312,15,2,9/29/2014,"Is it just me or have Australian surfer dudes taken over the Soho cafe market? Some experiences with them are good (eg Happy Bones) and some are bad... Two Hands has its work cut out for it. The service is spacey at best and the croissants are dried out. I welcome a new place to get coffee in this typically espressoless area, but this isn't an improvement over the typical Chinatown fare. The whole vibe of this place is ""Ugh, why did you come in? Is there a model behind you?"" If you're looking for a decent cup of coffee, just go to Nolita Mart a couple of doors down.",1
5313,15,4,9/27/2014,"these guys know you eat with your eyes first! went there for breakfast and enjoyed cappuccino and acai bowl (which to my mind could have contained some more fruits though). will definitely go there again to taste some other meals, too!",1
5314,15,4,9/27/2014,Have to try the avocado toast and create your own juice. Only downside is that it can be a little expensive eventually but you have to try this place once for sure though.,1
5315,15,4,9/21/2014,"I love Two Hands! Very picturesque and wholesome, I just wish they had Wifi, electrical outlets, and more tables/seats. I haven't had a chance to try out their food but their coffee is amazing. The Iced Chai is not so great, it was definitely not strong enough and too watery. Two Hands is not really a study kind of environment because of the crowd and lack of Wifi but it's a great place to bring friends and catch up!",1
5316,15,2,9/14/2014,coffee was ok; chai latte was horrible; service was extremely slow; the place does look great though; plenty of better options in the area i'd rather go to,1
5317,15,5,9/14/2014,"This place was my first stop in NYC last week, and it met and exceeded all expectations. It's super cute (though it was crowded), and everyone that works there is an attractive man, wearing an apron, with an accent. Swoon! I don't know if these guys came straight from down under, but I was not complaining. We snagged an outdoor seat and snacked on perfect avocado toast, while sipping on almond milk lattes. I forgot to order mine iced (they looked so refreshing in mason jars with red-and-white striped straws), but it was amazing nonetheless. This whole spot is out of an Instagram dream, and I can't wait to go back and try some other options (like the chia seed bowl or a milkshake)!",1
5318,15,5,9/5/2014,"Reaaaallllly good coffee!!! Got an iced coffee- they have really good almond milk Haven't tried the food yet, the menu is short and sweet, laid back store- all the staff are Aussies. This place is awesome as it is tucked away from the centre of Soho but is still at a super close proximity.",1
5319,15,4,9/4/2014,"Very good coffee and a splendid Acai bowl! We had coffee, Acai bowl and a juice. Relaxed ambience and a nice and rough decor with exposed brick walls. We are definitely enjoying our breakfast here again.",1
5320,15,5,9/3/2014,This place has the best coffee in Soho by far. Music is a little loud if you want to have a conversation. They have some nice simple food items and the atmosphere is very cool.,1
5321,15,3,8/31/2014,"Two Hands is the newest hipster cafe in out skirts of Chinatown. Keep your eyes out for this. I'm saying this because there's nothing special about the building so you'll definitely miss it if you are not paying attention. Upon entering, there's a hint of condescension from the ""locals"", I'm guessing because I came with my mother. From observation, if you hang out with 3 or more people, don't go to Two Hands, there won't be enough seats and the ""locals"" are pretty hesitant to give you a seat as they save their seat for their friend Who is more than an hour late. For coffee shop menu, this one is pretty different but nothing unique. I was recommended the Avocado Toast with the option of fried egg so I took it! I love fried eggs. The toast crust was extremely tough as I tried to cut it with a knife because I didn't want to look like a savage eating this hard toast with my bear hands. We also got a salad that was good but not extremely memorable. What I really enjoyed was that my coffee came into a mason jar. I love mason jars, although the straw accompanied was less than satisfactory, I had to switch to a plastic straw so I won't drink paper scraps that got torn off from my coffee. Will come back and update this!",1
5322,15,5,8/27/2014,"Gorgeous new favorite coffee spot. It isn't close to my home or job but I still make my way over there during lunch hour and on the weekends. The space alone is enough; beautiful whitewashed brick, sunny, pretty striped paper straws in my iced coffee... I've always enjoyed their coffee and just recently tried the banana bread, which they heat up and smear with ricotta if desired (omg), and the avocado toast topped with a fried egg. (Blew me away). On top of all that, the place is staffed with the sweetest people speaking to you in pretty Australian accents. Total win.",1
5323,15,3,8/18/2014,"I bet girls just loooooove this spot. It's white. like all white interior. It's got good coffee. and it's got about 10-12 Australian frat stars behind the counter who look like they'd sooner be starting a game of pickup rugby than making espressos. Seriously. I've never seen so many ppl behind a coffee counter. There's nothing particularly spectacular about this place, but I'm sure there will be those who love it.",1
5324,15,3,8/17/2014,"Cute, relatively large cafe that is right outside of Chinatown. I ordered the iced chai latte ($4) and avocado toast ($7), both of which left much to be desired. My bf, upon seeing my almost completely white drink, asked confused ""did you just get milk?"" Unfortunately, I might as well have, since the chai flavor was so light as to be practically nonexistent. I've tried many chai's throughout the years, and this ranks among the least exciting. The avocado toast is a thick square slice of bread, I think multigrain, covered with a generous spreading of avocado mash with pepper flakes and salt. It's served with a lemon slice. Some bites are a bit too salty, but overall it was a tasty snack. I don't think it's worth $7 though. I ordered an iced latte ($4) for the significant other, which was decent and refreshing. He gave it a so-so rating. Overall not impressed with the food, though the actual store and plethora of hipsters, mason jars, and colorful straws made for a cool ambience.",1
5325,15,5,8/14/2014,"Finally a place that makes good coffee! Of course... Run by the Aussies! Being an Aussie in NY, this place feels like a little piece of home. Same chilled Aussie vibe, great coffee super cute guys... An absolute must go to when you're in the neigbourhood.",1
5326,15,4,8/13/2014,"I like this place because I like hearing the Aussie accents from back home :) My guess is some of the staff are Bondi surfers but i'll have to find that out. The flat white's are great! Although I wish they had skinny milk. The bacon and egg rolls are on the expensive side for how big they are. I haven't tried them yet so can't judge too much. Anyway, i will defiantly go back for the flat whites and the accents :)",1
5327,15,1,8/10/2014,"From the moment they started construction on this place, I was eager to check it out. Two Hands has that specific hipster vibe where you just know from looking at it that good coffee is to be found inside. Finally got my chance to check it out yesterday, and while the coffee did not disappoint, everything else did. During my 15-minute wait in line, I decided on an iced coffee and the baked egg roll, only to be told they were sold out of the latter. At 10am. On a Saturday. At a breakfast establishment. I settled for the avo toast. As a lifelong New Yorker, ""NYC prices"" rarely faze me, but $7 for mashed avocado on a piece of bread the size of an iPhone is ridiculous. They can probably get away with charging these prices since there's nothing else like this place in the neighborhood, but I prefer not to feel like I've been robbed first thing in the morning. Next time I'm in the neighborhood, I'll hit up Baz or Nolita Mart instead. Their decor and coffee is on par with Two Hands', but blessedly come without such a pretentious crowd.",1
5328,15,5,8/7/2014,Cute coffee shop who know what a good flat white is. Awesome music and service. Washed brick walls and yummo avo toast.,1
5329,15,5,8/6/2014,"Finally a decent coffee in NYC ! Before coming to America I had no idea how particular we Australians are about coffee. Being an Australian cafe they definitely know what they are doing . The Outback Cap comes with TimTams but they didn't have any when we were there. However they did make the cappacino how we have it in Australia, with chocolate sprinkled on top. Delicious. Croissant, avocado toast and ricotta toast were also delicious. Friendly staff . General ambience of the place was really nice too, plenty of seating and room to move. Â Will be returning again and again .",1
5330,15,5,8/4/2014,"Gorgeous, new-ish Australian cafe in SoHo. All white interior, hip customers, sunflowers, exposed brick, and mason jars = an Instagrammer's dream. In fact, two girls I sat near were Instagramming their food for a good 10 minutes or so. Not even judging. A bunch of excellent cafes have been popping up in this area, all with a similar aesthetic. Fortunately Two Hands' serves up some pretty amazing drinks as well. Their iced almond milk latte was delicious! There was a hint of cinnamon, and it kept me wired for the whole day. Oh, and free cucumber/lime water served in real cups (not plastic)? Yes, please. It's a wonderful space in a great location, so I can see why it's been getting so popular.",1
5331,15,5,8/1/2014,"Stumbled upon this cafe while looking for NEW cafes actually for a job but instantly fell in LOVE with this place.. Really love this place due to the good atmosphere and amazing staff. ( their smiles and accents really just makes my day ) I work at a cafe in Chinatown towards LES and when I'm not working there, I'm here on my free days. I think that it's a great addition to the neighborhood! I hope nothing but great things!",1
5332,15,5,7/31/2014,"My friend introduced me to this place because were both coffee lovers. As soon as I stepped into the shop, I already fell in love with the atmosphere. The overall setup is just right and there's really relaxing coffee shop music as well. The brick walls give the place a really vintage feel and the coffee is just amazing. The latte art is so cute! This is definitely somewhere id keep coming back to!!",1
5333,15,5,7/27/2014,"Amazing coffee with a laid-back beach vibe in the middle of little Italy/Chinatown - reminded us of home! The staff here were so lovely and welcoming and the coffee is house roasted from a sustainable source Nicaraguan producer. Sunny, light and filled with beautiful photos, this place is going to be a Sunday afternoon regular! The juices and snacks are fantastic - way above par for a cafe - and the chilled cucumber and lime water is free! The outback cap has to be the best value deal below Houston. Highly recommend this place!",1
5334,15,4,7/27/2014,Really good coffee. Great spot to work with and open floorplan so you aren't crammed in there!,1
5335,15,4,7/26/2014,"decided to check this new coffee shop out since ive heard so many good things about it. honestly, it didnt wow me. the whole setup of the cafe & all the silverware they use is really cute. i thought the coffee was just okay. if you get the drinks to stay, its served in a mason jar with these cute striped paper straws. although cute, the straws turn moist after awhile. the food was expensive. i got a granola bowl & it was $9 .... i couldve made this at home for less than $5. there is also no wifi here. the bathroom is really cute tho !",1
5336,15,4,7/25/2014,"You know, some friends joked about a recent Australian invasion in New York City. Well, after visiting Two Hands and walking around Manhattan over the course of four days, I can confirm this rumor. I mean, I'm not complaining. Guys with Australian accents serving you artisanal coffee and pastries in the middle of Little Italy and Chinatown? Fiiiiiiine if you ask me... oh, and I'm talking about the coffee too! I had a delicious cold brew which was totally necessary when you're visiting New York on one of those epic humid summer days. The interior is well-designed. It's tasteful, understated, and also perfect for hanging out with friends. Fresh flowers, beautiful photographs, exposed brick... soooo Instagram friendly! Okay, even their w.c. is nicely appointed. It's open and airy which also another plus. In a neighborhood without many spots like this, Two Hands is a coffee shop that must stay open!",1
5337,15,5,7/25/2014,"Two Hands is worth checking out, definitely. A bunch of guys from Australia run the shop, and they're all pretty friendly. The coffee is great. There have a few drinks that are unique to Australians, like a flat white and an outback cap. The flat white is great. They have good water with lemons too. Nice bathroom. No wifi though, be forewarned.",1
5338,15,4,7/23/2014,"This place was perfection for one anything semi-intimate where you want good for, an aesthetically pleasing atmosphere, but no monetary or time commitment. Two hands was absolutely charming; a hidden gem in the streets near Little Italy. I ordered an almond milk cappuccino (out of curiosity) and my friend ordered an iced latte- both ""for here."" I know at a lot of these scene-y coffee shops, patrons are really interested in presentation. By this I mean, people tend to get very particular about the white foam caps on their ""to go"" cups and be very excited about coffee served in mason jars. There is no shame in this, and Two Hands really tailors to that interest. Everything looks like it is straight off of some very trendy person's Instagram... or at least that is how it appeared to me. The coffee was delicious; I am a huge coffee person, and I have sort of sipped my way across Manhattan in search of the best cup, and Two Hands is amongst the top few. The place was unique, too, which is one of its main draws. For one thing, the menu is interesting. Acai bowls are offered (although I can't really comment on these because I just had a chocolate croissant and a bite of my friend's avocado toast) and Young Coconuts are sliced open and punctured with straws, to be enjoyed on site. I thought it was all very refreshing, no pun intended. The avocado toast was somewhere above Little Collins/ Jack's Wife Freda, but below Cafe Gitane; regardless, it was yummy. Magazines like the New Yorker and Kinfolk are offered to patrons, hanging up invitingly on the beautiful, exposed-brick wall. I poked through Kinfolk while waiting for my sweet little drink to be brought to me. As I mentioned, the crowd is ""scene-y"" but nothing repulsive or overtly pretentious. All in all, this place harbors very good vibes, and serves excellent food. If you have the chance/are near by, I recommend trying it!",1
5339,15,4,7/22/2014,"This is a nice addition to the block. The space is beautiful, really nice open air, art on the walls for purchase. I love the green life throughout the shop. Really cool bathroom. Nice staff, even though are Australian ;) The coffee is great, nice selection of teas, sameies, snacks. Basically it's a nice spot to hang out and have a bevy. Double thumbs up, I'm a fan",1
5340,15,5,7/20/2014,"Fantastic coffee and great breaky. I know a good latte, not the easiest to find in the city, but this one delivered. We had the acai bowl and avocado and toast and couldn't fault it. Great vibe. This is a winner.",1

5343,15,5,7/12/2014,"Traveling around NYC for a good coffee shop is an endeavor. With literally hundreds clustered around, when you find one worthy of 5 stars it's exciting. Two Hands is in a great location not too far from Canal St. station and is found near beautiful Little Italy and crazy Chinatown. If you're into adventuring it's completely worth popping in for some coffee then walking around this area. I've worked in coffee for the past four years and theirs tastes great. They use ""cafe integral"" for their espresso and regular cups of coffee which tastes great. The baristas handled themselves really well and were very friendly and humorous in nature. Two Hands has a wide menu variety of pastries, juices, and coffee. Everything here I'm sure is worth the purchase. I recommend Two Hands to anyone and everyone that wants a great spot to relax, read, meet up with friends, just pop in to talk with the friendly baristas, whatever! What are you waiting for?",1
5344,15,2,7/11/2014,"Is FOSTERS really Australian for beer? I stumbled, literally, on this place when they opened a week ago. Open, clean, modern interior. Floor to ceiling windows with open air bench seating at the entrance for max chilling. Many, small round tables for two and a great big picnic table for spreading the love. Australian boys making coffee and smoothies. That is reason enough to come here. No homo. Coffee is very good. Strong and robust like my women. Smoothies are on standby until I finally get to that point in life when I'm in the mood for one. It's out of the way enough, for now, where you can chill here and not have to deal with the herd. But...And THIS is a big Kim Kardashian BUTT...NO WIFI...Really? Guess I'm still gonna park my ass at Nolita Mart down the street or Little Fox on Kenmare when working on my laptop. HOOK UP WIFI mates and I'd be here 2/3 x a week at the least. Â  Other then that, they have a very friendly staff that know their shate about coffee and have excellent Australian accents. I'm still debating whether or not they're actors. Be nice to them, they're not from here and aren't jaded. Yet. Â  I'd come back for coffee to go, but no point in coming here to work, which is why I chill in coffee shops so I don't kill myself in my apt. Biggest coffee shop in the area, in terms of space. It can get really loud in here because people actually talk to each other. At the end of the day, the no WiFi thing kills me.",1
5345,15,5,7/6/2014,Great new Aussie run cafe in little Italy. The smoothies are amazing; the coffee is fantastic. You should try the avocado toast. Definitely worth a visit!!,1
5346,15,5,6/30/2014,"I didn't know it on my first visit, but it turned out that I visited, this spot twice during their opening weekend. From day one, the coffee was brilliant! Â These two Aussie lads know how to craft a great coffee. Â Not only is the coffee good, but the decor is modern, bright, simple and welcoming. Â Two Hands is a breath of fresh air as it exports Aussie coffee culture to America. Though I'm just visiting, I'll be back to this spot every time I'm in NYC.",1
5347,15,5,6/29/2014,"This place is kinda everything I've ever wanted in a neighborhood spot. It's been open only 3 days and I've been here every day. They have complimentary water jugs with fresh mint and lemons, excellent coffee, and amaaaaaaaazing juices for very reasonable prices. The atmosphere is chill, the space is bright and open, and music good, too. If I could describe the place in one word, it would be fresh. It's refreshing to find a cafe in manhattan that is cool and still seats many. Welcome to the neighborhood!",1

5352,16,1,7/25/2014,"I just left this restaurant and in the three years I have lived in New York City I have never had worse service. We had about 4 different people come up to our table at different times. Our entrees we're served while the plates for our appetizers were taking over our table. We couldn't get anyone's attention to pick up our empty plates. We couldn't get anyone's attention to place another drink order. We got our menus for dessert very quickly, however no one came over to see if we wanted to order dessert or get our check. I had to call out to a waitress walking by to get our check. Then our waiter whom I believe was ""Angel"" but who knows, was talking to a woman for about 10 minutes before assisting the other person with getting our check sorted out. Worst service EVER. I would never ever return to this restaurant. Awful, awful, awful.. I can't believe this place is still in business.",-1

5354,16,1,3/23/2014,"Maialino deleted my original post, please find my original post below. --------------------------------------------------Â­------------ Terribly over rated... Awful waitress who took another table of 5's order before my table (party of 2) even though we sat down first. Â She also took about 10 minutes to explain the specials to us, sorry to tell you lady; you do not need to tell me every step by step detail as how the specials are made. Needless to say her delay in taking our order (we waited about 20 minutes for her to take our order) caused our food to come about 1 hr after we sat down. Our grilled octopus was cold and the bed of potatoes it was on was also cold.... My squid ink pasta had a squid ink sauce (gross, do not use squid ink in your sauce) and was under cooked. Â this dish was over salted, under cooked and all in all it looked like a black plate with black pieces of doodie on it. My gf's pasta was better, but still missing the mark as it was incredibly salty. For a restaurant that boasts a $35 lobster spaghetti this place is underwhelming and really needs to be knocked down from its 4 start status on yelp. Do the right thing and go to shake shack instead, at least there the food does not take 1 hr to hit your table. NEVER COMING BACK",-1

Â It will be my life's goal to bring the average star rating of this restaurant down. Update: deleted my second post when uploaded my review again. Â  ------ My original post is below: Oh Danny Meyer, if only you knew how horrible some of your wait staff is, you would totally fire their a$$es. I wanted to take my boyfriend out for a nice night after work, so I booked a spot here for Restaurant Week. Little did I know, they didn't have a Restaurant Week Dinner menu. Fine. I'll deal. Our waitress, Guiliana seemed promising at first... Stressing the AT FIRST. We waited 20 MIN until she took our orders. By then I realized she was derping when she scuffled over and squeaked that she ""didn't forget about us."" Ok lady, you were chatting up a storm to the 2 tables next to us. You totally forgot. Our appetizers didn't come out until 20-25 minutes later. The table who sat down before us already had their appetizer come out 10 minutes after we ordered. WUT. When the appetizers finally did come out, they were very underwhelming. The octopus was overcooked and the prosciutto di parma slices were so sad looking. PROSCIUTTO DI PARMA was sad. One of the most glorious cured meats and they managed to make it look sad. 40 MIN LATER... We got our entrees and they were both salty. The squid ink pasta was atrocious and my ox tail parpadelle was over salted. It was so salty that my tongue hurt. At this point, I was starving and ate it only out of necessity. Our waitress totally derped again when getting our check, meaning she didn't even get our check nor did she ask us why my boyfriend's meal was untouched. At this point, my boyfriend called over another waitress who called over the manager and had the horrible squid ink pasta taken off.

5358,16,1,3/18/2014,"STOP DELETING ME REVIEW Maialino! Maialino... what can I say about this establishment besides them deleting my 1 star review twice. Â I bet they will pay Yelp to delete this one too. On to the restaurant. Â First of all, they are incredibly rude and ridiculous overrated. Â The restaurant was rather empty. Â Me and my girlfriend had a reservation for 2 at 6pm and they ended up sitting us all the way in the back corner of the restaurant when there were plenty of seats available closer to the main dining room. This bring me to my point that these people seem to treat minorities terrible. Â There are only Caucasian people that dine here, Â and the one Asian table seemed to be having a worse time than my table. Firstly, me and my girlfriend got sat in the corner, no big deal. Â We don't see the waitress about 10 minutes later. Â We order our drinks when we see her. Â The drinks take about 5-10 minutes to arrive (quite long just for wine). Â During the wait, there was a white family of 5 that sat near us. Â The waiter proceeds to get their drinks, but before taking our food order, she goes over to that table and takes their food order before us! when we have been waiting to order for about 15-20 minutes. After we ordered the appetizers came out rather quickly withing 10 minutes, which isn't too slow. Â But then there was a 45 minute wait after that for our entrees. Â During the 45 minute wait, the waitress ignores us completely, not refilling our drinks, or scraping bread crumbs off our table. Â Nothing you would expect from a restaurant that costs this much. Anyway, our food finally arrives, cold.... Â Terrible, tasteless. Â I make better pasta than these guys, seriously. Â Pasta isn't fresh made, Â it is dry premade pastas. DO NOT EAT HERE. Final Verdict: - Over prices - Terrible Service - rude to minorities (no minorities were eating there - White supremacy to the max - Food is terrible - Go to shakeshack...",-1
5359,16,1,3/15/2014,"Ended up in NYC for an extra night after the rest of my group went home. Â So as a single walked into Maialino and tried to find a spot at the bar to hopefully have dinner. Â The place was packed with couples and large groups of regulars. Â Ordered a very tasty cocktail and things seemed to be loosening up as people migrated from the bar to tables. Â When I spotted a couple in the corner leaving I tried to make my way over to grab a seat. Â As I got close the bartender suddenly appeared over in that area in my path and as I attempted to get through said ""where are you going?"". Â I said to the open seat. Â He said, ""oh no, there is a wait list for bar seats"". Â Being alone and with a lot of people around and listening I felt like a child being scolded. Â It did not seem like there was a practice of a list of people waiting because I watched others walk up to the bar without his approval. Â He acted like he was some big shot with all his cronies and regulars and who the hell was I? Â I have eaten at Union Square Cafe 25 times and referred so many people there also. Â I have never felt such a lack of customer service or respect ever at USC. Â The feeling was very un-welcoming. Â This salt peppered hair bartender was a jerk and I immediately walked out.

5361,16,1,3/9/2014,"Don't bother with the private dining at the chef's table in the wine room. You'll be more comfortable at the bar. I surprised my boyfriend by booking the chef's table in the private wine room to celebrate a milestone birthday, but the experience turned out to be completely disappointing. As advertised, the location was cozy and candle-lit, but to our surprise it was uncomfortably cold. Â When we arrived, the hostess suggested we keep our coats to stay warm - that should have been a red flag right from the start. It was so crazy cold that we actually had no option but to wear out coats during the meal. Â Our server attempted to warm us up by offering me a pashmina to cover my legs and convincing the sommelier to turn the wine room fan off periodically. Â Still, our feet, hands, and noses were ice cold to the touch. Â It felt as though we were eating in a meat locker instead of a wine room. Â  We tried to make the best of a bad situation, until finally, we decided it was too uncomfortable and too cold to endure. Â We asked to move to a table in the dining room to finish the rest of our tasting menu, but were informed that there were no tables in the main dining area for 45 minutes. Â Our only option was to move to a table next to the entrance in the bar, which we did because ANYTHING was better than the freezing private wine room. That evening the restaurant did not make any effort to make up for the poor dining experience, and ultimately we paid the full price of the specialty private dining even though we ended up in the bar. Â I contacted the private dining manager and explained how poorly the night turned out and how little was done by management to try and recover what was left of our special evening. Â She said she would put something in the mail for our troubles. I never received anything and after following up, she said it was sent to the wrong address... I was told the package would be sent again, but nothing ever arrived. I cut my losses and permanently cut Maialino from my list of go-to restaurants for special occasions.",-1

5364,16,1,2/10/2014,"I thought this place was a BUST! First off they sat us in the worst seat in the entire place! No view of the park! Â The menu is extremely confusing and hard to navigate. Most of the dishes are written in Italian with no good description in English. There were about 10 different people that came over to our table they all had about as much personality as a stick. The artichoke dish was overcooked. The lettuce of the salad I ordered had not been washed! So I bit into a huge chunk of dirt. The sandwich I got was not what I expected so I had to send it back. My friend ordered lamb and it tasted ok but was filled with fat. The wine was good that's about it! As well as the free mints in the bathroom. Overall this place was overpriced and not worth the money. A lot of hype and nothing special I left with a headache and a stomachache. Â On top of that the chairs aren't sturdy and fall over when you stand up. Surprisingly this placed is packed and popular I just don't get it. My friend left a huge tip, which I thought was totally unnecessary! If I was there alone I would of stormed out after the dirt in the salad.

For pasta, I tasted all of the dishes that had a tomato sauce, and the sauce for all was not very good. I also had the pasta with mint and fava beans which was unappetizing. For the main course, I had pollo alla diavola which was moist but not spicy at all. I also had roasted potatoes on the side which was overly sweet.

5378,16,2,1/19/2010,"Danny Meyer may know how to run a four star restaurant but I question his [or his staff's] ability to select comfortable bar stools. That was just the beginning to a somewhat shaky first meal experience at his new Gramercy Park 'Roman Italian' eatery attached to the over-indulgent Gramercy Park Hotel. The chairs are, in a word, uncomfortable and while there are quite a few of them, I'm sure I'm not the only person who has found them slippery, confining and downright uncomfortable. But I digress. I came in looking for some terrific pasta and what I should have done is head over to 9th avenue and found a red sauce spaghetti house that's good, cheap and knows what comfortable seating is all about. But I didn't. And here's why: If Danny Meyer owns/runs something, it's suppose to be good - very good. So I allowed the reputation to get ahead of the meal and ended up at one of the bar area communal tables for dinner. Mistake. My food was okay; not terrific. The sauce was a bit too creamy and a bit too peppery. Believe me, I ate it all. But the downer was the lack of attention from the waitstaff [something mentioned in other reviews] at the bar. No salt. No pepper. No follow-up to see if it was good. Just a plate of pasta, an inquiry about my interest in dessert and the check. After an hour, I was ready to leave. Will I come back? Perhaps - but not to sit in the bar area... the people in the dining room looked like they were having much more fun.",-1

And while the hostess was apologetic, I thought it would have been a much nicer touch if she'd actually offered us a glass of wine on the house for our inconvenience, which I think is something most restaurants tend to do. It would have been especially appreciated it in this case, considering we racked up quite a nice bill in the Rose Bar while we waited, where cocktails are $20 a pop. Don't get the fig and ricotta crostini. They had sort of a medicinal aftertaste which we couldn't totally identify. The rest of the food was good enough, but my bucatini al amatriciana was only okay compared to the insane, go-blind-from-deliciousness version at Lupa (where you also get more of it). Our water glasses remained empty for much of the evening, which is a personal peeve of mine. As typically devoted Danny Meyer fans, we were disappointed.",-1

Â  PRIMI: The two of us split the spaghetti alla carbonara. Â The texture of the spaghetti was good, but the dish was SO salty that I could taste nothing else. Â  ENTREE: For our entree, we had the maialino al forno, which was supposed to be the highlight of our meal. Â It was ok, but definitely not the best that I have tried. Â The skin was chewy, not crispy. Â And while I understand that great ingredients don't need to be overwhelmed with seasoning, the meat could have benefited from some seasoning (aside from salt). Â  DESSERT: Â For dessert, we had the flourless chocolate cake dessert (forgot the real name) with buttermilk ice cream. Â This, I liked. Â And I don't even like flourless chocolate cake. Â  Service-wise, our waitress was professional. Â Not too friendly, but then again, that's not her job.",-1

When I ordered a glass of champagne, a bartender gave me a glass of prosecco instead. It was not even a mistake (I wish it was). I believed he assumed I would not know the difference. For the restaurant with that level, I do not think it is acceptable. It is pretty unfortunate and I don't' think I can't take my people anymore as I do not want to be embarrassed.

My friend got the raviolo al uovo--he's obsessed with eggs, but while this dish tasted delish, it was a small portion and not very satisfying. We also tried the suckling pig ragu which was rich and complex and so delicious. The frittata blanca which my cousin got was pretty disappointing and unexciting. so overall, 2 for 4, which is not a great average.

Â I can't sit at the bar? Â It was a most confusing exchange and it left me feeling very unwelcome at a restaurant I had been waiting to enjoy. Â It was also very contrary to the welcoming reputation which Danny Meyer enjoys at all of his restuarants. Â So, I think the story is that if you want to sit at the bar, you put your name on a list. Â If you are waiting to eat in the restaurant, I guess you have to stand at the bar (not sit). Â Personally, I found this to be very discouraging. Â Is this a new trend in the city? Â Reserved bar stools? Â I hope not. Â I think that they need to revisit this policy. Â Whoever heard of not being able to wait (sit) at the bar before their dinner.

5389,16,3,11/19/2009,"So Danny Meyer sensed New York doesn't have enough Italian restaurants. Â What's next for him, a tapas bar? Â The interior is inoffensive, but it won't win any awards. Â I'm not sure whether a Roman would feel at home here. Â The bathroom area is downright gloomy. Â Haven't we moved past communal washrooms? Â The bar stools, with its not-quite seat backs, are uncomfortable if your ass is bigger than 12-year old's. Â Sound level is more than lively when the room is full. Â Staff is friendly, but can get inattentive when they get slammed. Â Staff also is not entirely well versed with the items on the menu.

I have to admit that it was chewy and a bit fatty. In turns out the name Maialino means ""piglet"". This now all makes sense. I had the rabbit and pasta dish. My pasta was overcooked but the sauce was balanced and the rabbit was very tender. For the main course, I had the roasted lamb and it was delicious. It was cooked medium and had rosemary and a touch of sea salt. i really enjoyed my meal. I didn't give the restaurant 5 stars because some of the other pasta dishes I tasted were overcooked. Otherwise, the flavors were great. The service was also excellent and it is a fun place. You definitely don't feel like you are on top of other patrons. This restaurant was well designed.",-1

I was a little confounded by the extensive Italian wine list given that I am CA wine devotee. The waiter kindly agreed to help me make a selection; however, his suggestions primarily came from the wine by the glass wine list, and I was hoping to order something a little more special. Â  The sommelier was making her rounds to almost all of the tables within view, and I expected she would Â stop by our table to offer her direction, too. No such luck. We apparently were not on her radar screen. Otherwise dinner was delicious and the wait staff most accommodating. But the sommelier was MIA.",-1

5402,16,4,7/12/2012,I ate here last Saturday with my family of four. We made an impromptu reservation for 10PM and were given a nice table around 9:55PM. The food was great. Among our favorite dishes were the octopus salad (appetizer) and the suckling pig (entree shared amongst the four of us). Our only complaint would be in regards to the service. Two times we were given our shared appetizers and shared sides without serving spoons; the waitstaff was a bit hard to reach when we needed something.,-1
5403,16,4,5/16/2012,"I went to Maialino 2 weeks ago for dinner on Friday evening. Â I had a couple of Â 'tapas-appetizers' (prosciutto di Parma and Parmigiano Reggiano). Â The portion was too small and overpriced. Â The quality was very good, not exceptional. Â  Then, I had spaghetti alle vongole. It was perfect. Â  I also tried the pasta with meat sauce. Very tasty, maybe a little too much... in overall a good dish Desert: I tried a couple, simply awesome! I want to go back to try more dishes. Â I will write an update For now I give 4 stars",-1
5404,16,4,3/18/2012,"I went to Maialino on Friday night for dinner for the first time and had a great experience overall. Â The food was quite good, as I expected. Â I had the Bolognese with duck ragu, which I would highly recommend. Â We started off with a selection of 7 cheeses, which were also very good. Â The server was very friendly and while it took him too long to take our orders, we were enjoying our wine, so I didn't care all that much. Â He was very thoughtful and checked in with us frequently afterwards. Â The menu is a bit hard to understand, which is slightly frustrating, but the server provided some great recommendations. Â My girlfriend had a homemade pasta with pepper sauce which was delicious. Â Their cocktail list could use a little updating, as no one at the table loved their cocktails, but again, not enough to keep me from coming back. Â Overall, the atmosphere was great, the food and service was good, and the prices were reasonable. Â I'll be back!",-1
5405,16,4,2/27/2012,"Enjoyed having brunch here, wait staff very efficient and helpful, food excellent. A little heavy on the pork choices, would have liked more protein variety.

Professional, knowledgeable staff, great food, wonderful location (the beautiful Gramercy Park Hotel), extensive selection of superb Italian wines. A little hard to get a table w/o reservation during peak dinner hours. Bring your platinum charge card (or a rich friend) and perhaps visit the Rose Bar across the lobby for a nightcap...if you dare feel cool enough. (# of visits: over 20, including for desserts or bar-fare)",-1
5408,16,4,11/18/2011,"I love coming to Maialino, whether it's for Sunday brunch or a late night date at the back tables the staff are always responsive to the mood and the only time the food has disappointed me is when they take something I really liked off the menu (*ahem*, Olive Cake!) - then again, what they replace it with always makes this restaurant a venue I want to come back to regularly!",-1
5409,16,4,11/21/2010,"I went here for a special occasion dinner and I'd have to only recommend this place for that sort of thing. It's pretty expensive and fancy for anything else (at least for dinner). Â  Food: We shared the artichokes and they were luxurious. Perfectly cooked, no hard bits, just crispy on the outside, melty inside. This was followed by two pastas - one with white truffles (seasonal) and the other was the Malfatti al Maialino, which roughly translates to ""badly-made"" with baby pig. Wow. Show-stopper. The Times recently published a close estimation of the recipe and it take 3 days to make. The badly-made refers to the irregularly shaped pasta sheets, which fold like little tissues. The sauce is rich, but there's only a bit, spotted with bits of soft piggy. The flavor is unreal. Then we had the signature dish Maialino, which is some of the best roasted pig I've ever had. It feeds 4 easily. Drinks: They have a great wine list..let the server help you choose something that will complement your meal. We had a Grenache that was the perfect balance for the pig..light and fruity. Service: Totally impeccable and friendly. Danny Meyer's 51%ers at their finest. Decor: It's biggish and felt a little loud and brasserie like when seated in the middle of the room. I'd try to request a booth for next time.",-1
5410,16,4,9/19/2010,"Excellent service, impeccable in fact. Food wise, the pastas are always flawless, veggie sidedishes were creative within the context of 'Roman' style food. Not being a hog lover, this is all I can say.",-1
5411,16,4,8/30/2010,Big slab of pork with crispy skin is the main special. Enough to feed a small family. Cheeses were pretty ding-dong good. House made pasta was also good. This place gets extra points for having chub-friendly stools at the bar.,-1
5412,16,4,5/3/2010,"I love my neighborhood even more since Maia' moved in. Â The ricotta pancakes...divine. Â Their pastry chef is a goddess and I dream about the brioche caramellato. Â really. Coffees pretty close to what you'll get in a bar in Italy. Â I only wish I was more of a morning person so I could enjoy the bar/pastries/coffee/newspaper more often before going to work. As for dinner...every meal I've had has been well prepared, quite refined even. Â However, the cacio e pepe is a bit salty for my taste. Â But I enjoy it so much and am so impressed with the genuine service a la Union Sq Cafe that I only wish they offered more dishes without meat...yes, I know it's called Maialino but it's an italian restaurant - more primi senza carne per piacere!",-1
5413,16,4,1/15/2010,"I had dinner Friday night at Maialino for the first time. I loved the look of the restaurant. It reminded me of an upscale country kitchen. I liked the openness of the restaurant including the bread station and the salumeria station. My companion and I were greeted by the host from the moment we walked through the doors till we left. Service was very attentive, and our water glasses were always full. We started with the chef's selection of salumeria. The prosciutto was delicious. The soppresata was good, but we both preferred Espositio's from Court Street in Brooklyn. The tonnarelli pasta made with pecorino and black pepper was creamy with a bite from the pepper,albeit a little heavy on the salt. Delicious. We had the Â  roast suckling pig. I've read some of the other reviews, and I have to say the pig was devine. The skin was very crisp as it should be, and the meat was succulent and juicy. It is definitely for 3 people, so if you are a duo, you will have leftovers. The dining room was a bit noisy. but Â I would go back.",-1
5414,16,5,10/22/2014,Was there for a breakfast Very friendly staff and a good atmosphere there to hang out for a while.,-1
5415,16,5,9/21/2014,"Loved everything we ordered. Rabbit, tomato pasta, halibut, fried zucchini and eggplant. Pasta was cooked al dente and thats what made it perfect. The service was good and the place was busy. Dessert was nice too. I feel portions are a little small but other than that we had a fun. Will definitely return.",-1
5416,16,5,9/16/2014,"I am sometimes skeptical of restaurant week deals, as the menu may not represent the restaurant in its best form. This was definitely not the case at Maialino. Went in there without any expectations and came out a changed person. Very happy with dinner. Â Service was excellent. Â Had the Salumi Assaggio, Spaghetti Alla Carbonara, the Pollo Alla Diavolo and the Tartufo. Â I'd have to say i'm both a Carbonara and a chicken snob and both were excellent. Â The Carbonara was well seasoned (not over salted) with a very nice crispy Guanciale (crispy but not too fatty). Â Better than ones I've had at Otto and Prune. Â The chicken was cooked to perfection with very moist white meat. Â Tartufo was a surprise. Â Had these light crunchy chocolate pieces over chocolate ice cream over a cherry, very good! Go there and make a reservation to go back at the same time!",-1
5417,16,5,4/4/2014,"It's always crowded, but you can get a seat for 2 still sometimes. The lamb chops and half chicken are the best I've tasted yet, especially the lamb which is very tender. The ambiance is nice, a little loud at times, but if you can get a reservation and have seats in the back, it's great for a small group or a date.",-1
5418,16,5,3/1/2014,Wonderful staff. Â Perfection in its pasta. Â The only thing I dislike about Maialino is that it's difficult to get in without significant advanced planning. Â Sigh ... I suppose one can't have it all.,-1
2569,16,5,2/25/2014,"Food service was very paced as well. Nothing came out to quickly, but these are definitely dishes you need to eat slowly and savor. The ambience of the restaurant reflects it: earthy, wood panels, dim lights. The food was excellent. Even though it lacks the ingenuity of some of the top-end restaurants, everything was delicious.",-1
5419,16,5,2/13/2014,"From the friendly greeting at the front to the highly professional service to the brilliance of the food, Maialino will live i n your culinary memory a long time. Their seasonal salads are inspired. As are their pastas. Best Carbonara I've ever had. They even have first-rate gluten free pasta made right there. Of course the star is the maialino - perfectly done roast suckling pig. Try not to pass on that one. Although there so many choices, making every decision at every course one of beautiful agony. For a meal of pure magic, it's Maialino all the way.",-1

Danny Meyer's restaurants all emphasize great service and I have always been treated very well here. The mixed berry ricotta pancakes are perfectly made and flavorful. The berries and ricotta come on the side so you can add to your taste. The pastas and meat dishes are delicious and fresh. You won't leave feeling heavy at all! Great flavors all around. Definitely make reservations in advance. Maialino books up fast!,-1

We were determined to simply share some pastas, but the special was the suggling pig..how could we resist...outstanding. My best meal this year (sorry Gramercy Tavern). The place is beautiful and confortable, the service i outstanding and the food near perfection............. everything from cocktails to dessert was perfect. I will be back..over and over again. Actually I was tempted to write a bad review just to keep everyone else away...but that would be selfish. Enjoy.",-1

The Sous Chef Jason made a meal accommodating a few of our requests and our server, Amanda, was friendly and very passionate about the food. Out of all of the courses, I loved the homemade pasta course with ricotta and pecorino. Wonderfully spicy kick, but not overwhelming. My husband's favorite was probably the lamb - I'm kind of surprised he didn't eat the bone. The wine room was definitely worth it for a special occasion!",-1
5430,16,5,5/21/2012,"I'm a sucker for Danny Meyer restaurants. Breakfast - believe the hype, it really is one of the best breakfasts in town. Â Usually slow (if you avoid weekend brunch) and great service. Â Best soft scrambled eggs and the crispy headcheese (which I think they have now renamed pork terrine) is also good. After Breakfast / before lunch - serving baked goods mainly, great for just a snack. Â Good coffee. Â Lets call it elevenses. Where else are you going to go for elevenses? Lunch - great sandwiches and pastas usually crowded Dinner - my least favorite time of day to dine. Â It gets crazy and with the new arrangement of tables in the bar area (cramming them in) if you don't have a reservation in the dining room it get s a little too loud and crazy. Late night - my favorite time to be here after breakfast. Â Great snack menu that isn't just rehashed stuff from the rest of the day's menu - these are distinctly different items from what is served during the day. Â Had some amazing pork ribs and also pig heart salad. Â Sadly they don't open very very late. Â Downside you get some weird hotel guests late night. Â Also despite everything Danny Meyer does about service, I still feel annoyed being the last guy eating at the bar while the staff count their money at the other end of the bar. Â Seriously? Â you have a great big restaurant with lots of other tables to be doing that! Generally I find this place seriously awesome - I was going to give 4 stars for all the little things that bug me (like the host/hostess always makes me feel like I'm being done a favor) but the fact is I keep going back so 5 it is.",-1
5431,16,5,1/3/2012,"I had one of the best dining experiences of my life at this at this restaurant. It's a pricy place and a reservation is hard to get. But for a special occasion I can't think of a better place to go. The restaurant is beautiful. The best way I can describe is, it's the type of place you might find a 40's movie star drinking a scotch. The bar tender was helpful in picking out cocktails, and the waiter was super helpful in helping us decide what to eat. He even engaged us while we talked about food and NYC, even though he was extremely busy. He talked us through the suckling pig entree. It was a big undertaking at 90 bucks, but he ensured us that it will feed the four of us. He also told us about how we can order a side of extra parts, like pork shoulder and cheak for an extra price. To me this was one of the best parts of the meal, and we wouldn't have thought to get it without his suggestion. Before it was brought out to us, a waiter brought the pig to the table before it was cooked, asking our approval as if it were an uncorked bottle of wine. I was very immpressed. When it was served, it turned out to be one of the best things I've ever tasted, it was one of those meals you will just never forget. The skin was so crispy and about an inch thick. Under that skin was the most tender, juicy pork I've ever eaten. I'm no chef but I swear it had to have been slow cooked for days, for weeks! For dessert we ordered one of my favorites- affogato, and the waiter came out to poor the espresso over the creamy vanilla gilato himself. Again, impressed. Another point to make about the service - I tweeted at the restaurantseveral times, expressing my excitement for the meal to come, and they responded almost immediatly each time, to the delight of me and my dining buddies. This was on a busy holiday weekend night. This may be a bit dramatic but at the end of the night I actually hugged the waiter. I will never forget this night, this meal and this restaurant. Between the service, the atmosphere, the drinks and the food, it's a NYC gem.",-1
5432,16,5,10/28/2011,"Superb. It's hard to get a table, but if you can get there first thing (9AM!) on weekends, the breakfast/brunch food is unbeatable. Also a terrific spot to drop by on Saturday afternoon for a glass of wine and cheese. One of the NYC's best places ever.",-1
5433,16,5,8/27/2011,"Excellent food and service and atmosphere was perfect. You must try Malfatti Al Maialino suckling pig ragu & arugula, if you eat meat ,otherwise go for Tonnarelli Cacio E Pepe you will not regret.",-1
5434,16,5,8/17/2011,"The cacio e pepe I had here last night seriously tasted just as good as my favorite trattoria in Rome. Â Broccoli Rabe was absolutely perfect as well. Â Very impressed with the food. Â Space was a bit cavernous and lacked warmth, but service was attentive and professional.",-1
5435,16,5,8/14/2011,"Maialino has overtaken Lupa as my favorite Italian restaurant in Manhattan. Â A friend and I grabbed dinner here on a Thursday night. Â First tip...ask your server for the bar menu prior ordering. Â There are some great starters there that are not on the regular menu. Started out with the Salumi Misti and the octopus appetizer. Â Delicious. Â Followed up with the Bavette in Guazzetto, which was outstanding. Â Very unique flavor and a bit of heat. Â Also sampled my friend's Fettucine Bolognese, which was terrific. Â The fried zucchini and vinegar is also a must have (not what we expected, almost like zucchini chips). Â  For wine, check out the Shiava (SCHIAVA, HUCK AM BACH, CANTINA SANTA MAGDALENA). Â Very light with a bit of spice. Â Perfect with the pastas. Definitely headed back here again...",-1

The menu is stacked with really nice options. Â I had the Garganelli with rabbit. Â It was weirdly citrus-y but, really excellent. Â Garganelli is always my favorite, wish more places had that kind of pasta. The plate next to mine I might have liked even better, it was a corn ravioli. Â Sweet and savory! Â  The charcuterie seemed to be freshly sliced and very tasty. One problem: Â The table was too small. My wine glass almost spilled on me a few times as my company was reaching for bread... or maybe we just ordered too much food. haha this place is the bee's knees",-1
5438,16,5,5/24/2011,"I fell in love with Maialino the first time I visited, and have been back countless times since. Â The food is consistently excellent. Â We always start with the lightly fried artichokes, which are perfectly cooked - not mushy, not too crispy. Â Last time, we ordered the Maialino ""suckling pig"" for 2, and it was succulent and flavorful, with an incredible crispy skin. Â We also had the carbonara a few times, and each time the pasta was perfectly al dente, and the sauce light and silky, just as carbonara should be. Â  The best dessert of all time is the Torta della Nonna, or ""Grandmother Cake,"" which is a lemon pastry cream in a tart shell, covered in pine nuts, dusted in powdered sugar, and served with a lemon caramel sauce. Â Former pastry chef Jenn made it best, but the new chef is doing it justice - maybe the sauce was just a bit too acidic - but the overall dessert still delicious. Â  Maialino brunch is great as well - the lemon ricotta pancakes are light and sweet, and the homemade doughnuts served warm - so delicious!",-1

5440,16,5,2/8/2011,"Wow. Â My friend and I made reservations for dinner here for one of our two nights in NYC last week. Â We read about it in Zagat and could only get the 5:30 p.m. reservation (always a good sign). Â We made plans to go before we saw a Broadway show. Â  From the arrival, the restaurant has a very warm and friendly feeling - almost like you are walking into your mom's kitchen (not really what I expected being connected to the Grammercy Park hotel). Â The hostess greeted us immediately and our coat's were quickly checked in the coat room. Â  I loved the seating in the dining room - very open and again, warm and inviting but not too noisy (yes, there were others dining at 5:30-7 pm). Â The food and wine list is so amazing, we did not know where to start - thankfully our server made great recommendations. Â I started with the Insalata Misticanza (my favorite) and it did not dissapoint. Â My friend had the Prosciutto e Mozzarella as her first course and it was delicious. Â For my main course, I had the Agnolotti di Zucca and it was incredible. Â The flavor and texture were just right; I savored every bite. Note: the portions are just right and perfect for sharing. Â I would recommend ordering 2-3 courses/person. Our experience at Maialino was excellent and I would highly recommend it.",-1

Â Hands down the best pork ragu I've ever had. Â I've heard great things about the maialino (the suckling pig), but it serves about 4 people, so I'm waiting for a big enough group to try it. Â  The chicken is also out of this world. Â I've always been a bit bored of chicken entrees because they always taste similar, but the chicken here is bathed in a spicy, vinegary sauce that is unlike anything I've had at an Italian restaurant. Â It's also cooked perfectly so that the skin is light and crispy and the meat is tender. Â Both times I went, everyone made sure to soak up the sauce with whatever bread we had leftover. Corn and ricotta ravioli was also delicious and fairly unique. Waitstaff is excellent and very friendly. But, the crowning achievement here is the pork!",-1

Service: This gets an A+ We were very well taken care of from beginning to end. Seated at a table we requested on the spot. Our dinner service was prompt and very friendly, water replenished consistently. Dinner: First things first, you MUST order the Carciofini FrittiFried aka Artichokes & Lemon. This appetizer was mind-blowing. An excellent start to our meal and a wonderful dish to share with friends. The only salad on the menu was the Radicchio and it was lackluster. I'd suggest you put your money towards something else on the menu. I ordered the LumaconiSausage, Kale & Black Truffle. Delicious but very rich and maybe a tad too salty for me. The portion is just the right size, anything larger and I might have felt very sick. I tried a taste of the SpigolaSalt-Baked Sea Bass & Funghi Trifolati and was very pleased with those few bites, another dish I would recommend. Dessert: We ordered the CrostataCranberry Tart & Apple Gelato. It was fine but a sad conclusion to our very fantastical meal. I would probably have stuck with just the gelato. The tart was good but maybe something I would have had just as a morning snack. I hope to come here again.",1
5450,16,5,1/2/2015,"We enjoyed the nicest New year's Day brunch yesterday. Â Starting with a well deserved cappuccino, which was explained by the bartender, beans are hand ground, with a beautiful leaf design. Â We had to wait for the hand ground...but what came after was well worth the wait. The bread basket & olive oil were a tease. Â Began with fried artichoke with lemon, perfection. Â I had the heavnly scrambled eggs (including out of this world cheese)looked like half dozen eggs, could feed a family of four! Â My husband had an egg sandwich with pancetta on a gorgeous baguette. Â Daughter had fried egg with greens. Â The fried potatoes were the best ever...only guessing they're fried in something sinful, but it's New Years Day. Â As a treat because January 2nd starts the promises...we shared ricotta pancakes, they were fluffy, light, delectable! Â Danny Meyer & team are brilliant! Â I won't eat like this till next New Years, but it was so worth it!",1
5451,16,4,1/1/2015,"What a great place for weekend brunch! Â It's located in a great neighborhood. Â Even though I over-ate, I walked it off with a stroll around the neighborhood which has great architecture.",1
5452,16,5,1/1/2015,"Have now eaten there 3 times and in each instance the experience was superb. Service has been excellent w/ the sommeliers leading the way with both recommendations and service.nthe menus changes but our meals have always been excellent from appetizer (truffle fondue dish was incredible but seasonal) to mains (pastas have been uniformly delicious). Desserts too provide a very nice end. The setting is beautiful with all tables well spaced and positioned. Again the service is excellent, attentive and yet never a rushed sense.",1
5453,16,5,12/31/2014,"Wow wow wow. Â For once, coming with a big group, I got the chance to try almost ALL of the dishes on Maialino's brunch menu and every single dish was off the hook bordering from amazing to transcendental Our group of 4 ordered way too much and got to try the Ricotta pancakes, Stone Cut Oatmeal, Toffee Brioche, Cacio & Pepe, Parppadella and the Malfatti, Saltimbocca and the Patate. All of it was delicious and with the exception of the Oatmeal which was standard, I would order all of these again in a heartbeat especially the pastas. My favorite pasta was hands down the Malfati and the Potatoes - WOW. I can't wait to come for dinner in a few weeks",1
5454,16,4,12/31/2014,"the food is amazing, and the staff is friendly!",1
5455,16,5,12/25/2014,"I was really excited to try this place out after hearing only good things about it. Gladly, I was not disappointed one bit. The place is dim-lit and a ""kitchen-like"" atmosphere (if that makes sense?). I would highly recommend going for the tour of the menu option if you are with a large group of people. Basically, the chef hand picks items to try out from all parts of the menu. We tried out 6 plates from each category... so we basically tried out everything? I do not have any complaints with the food, everything was delicious. I would highly recommend going for the bone marrow and lamb chops... they are TO DIE FOR! Overall, I would come back here for sure.",1
5234,16,5,12/22/2014,"Love Maialino. Have been here several times for dinner and brunch. Â The place is always packed but even when I don't have a reservation, they've been able to accommodate me (I'd caution this with the fact that my party is usually small if I don't have a ressie, and not at the peak hour b/t 7-8). I took some visitors here for Sunday breakfast/brunch - they loved it. Â I've had most of their egg dishes, this time I tried the Porchetta sandwich. Â This is not light breakfast fare! Â I only ate 1/2 and packed the other half to go....but Maialino does this weird doggy bag check thing where they give you a number and have you claim your leftovers at the front on the way out. Â Not surprisingly, I forgot to do that and I remembered a few hours later in the day when I started getting hungry again and wondering where my other 1/2 sandwich went. DDOH. Â  But the 1/2 I ate was delicious and I'd go back just to have it again. They also top off your coffee without charging you for an extra cup. Â Don't know why that surprised me.",1
5456,16,2,12/20/2014,The food was just ehh. Called 2x to ensure the full menu was available til 12 them arrived and found out only a limited bar menu. Very disappointing. The manger came over and comped us the first round which was nice. The service was not great given I asked 3x for the plates to be cleared. Underwhelming overall,1
5457,16,4,12/18/2014,"Maialino, off of gramercy park, is such a lovely space I could stay all day. It gets beautiful light in the afternoon which makes for a great brunch and transitions well into night. The staff is wonderful here. From server to hostess to bartender to manager it's clear they want to make sure you are enjoying your meal/experience. It's really elegant without being uptight or taking itself too seriously. I'm sad to say I've never eaten a protein here: just pasta, crostini antipasti, veggies, and desserts. Carbonara, cacio e pepe, artichokes, chocolate bread pudding w/ hazelnut ice cream...very roman inspired. There's a lot to be said for the reliability and quality of a restaurant, and each time I visit maialino I am not let down.",1
5458,16,5,12/17/2014,"Excellent Italian. It just smells so good when you walk in. The pasta is great, all the apps very good. The wine list is extensive and mostly Italian(except for a nice selection of Champagne). Try the: Radicchio Spaghetti alla Carbonara Pappardelle (lamb ragu) Testarella (Crispy suckling pig's head, if you're adventurous)",1
5459,16,2,12/11/2014,"You guys. I was so excited to go to this place. I wanted it to be amazing. I really did. I picked out what I was going to eat in advance. I practically skipped through the door. I even ordered a $24 glass of Barolo. But this place was MEH. Scallops and citrus were good, but not spectacular, and had exactly zero presentation: literally thrown in a bowl and served. Suckling pig: I hope you want your suckling pig to be a smiling pig head complete with teeth. Because that's what it is. (I admit that this particular aspect of my overall indifference to this place might be exclusively my problem; I prefer my suckling pig to be .... pre-sliced.) The carbonara is BALLER. I'll give you that. But come on. That was $19 of a $200+ very, very average dinner for two.",1
5460,16,4,12/9/2014,"The signature roast suckling pig is reason enough to make a trip to this solid restaurant in the gramercy park hotel. The food is straightforward and delicious. Another plus is the wine list, both by the glass and by the bottle. They really take the time to know their products.",1
5461,16,4,12/8/2014,"Maialino is our favorite Italian restaurant in the city. So why the 4*? We've been to Maialino a handful of times now. During these visits, we tried (between us) half the pastas on the menu and a few appetizers. (we're not big secondi eaters). Our favorites, by far, are the malfatti, cacio e pepe, and lamb ragu. So, yet again, we walked in around 10:30 pm on a Sat night and were seated within 10 minutes (without a reservation). I suspect we were not dressed appropriately, though, because we were seated in the more casual bar area, rather than the nicer and more elegant dining room in the back. Unfortunately we were seated next to a table full of very loud bros (none of whom, I noticed, ordered any food, just drinks). Fine. The service just got worse after that, though. First, our server immediately gave us stink eye after I ordered the least expensive wine on the menu and my very-pregnant wife ordered no alcohol. Also, since it was late, we decided to skip appetizers, settling on a cheese course and two pastas -- cacio e pepe and malfatti. The cheese came out promptly, but the pastas took way too long to arrive. And when they did, they were underwhelming. I'm glad we'd tried superior versions of these dishes on previous visits, because the dishes we got were cold, and the suckling pig in the malfatti (one of my favorite pasta dishes in the city) was not as tender as usual. While the pastas were underwhelming, the evening got better after the bros left and we ordered dessert. We got the pera zabaglione -- red wine poached pears with vanilla cream. Delicious! I don't know what happened that evening. Service (and food) are generally excellent here. Maybe our server was having a bad day, or the kitchen staff were overworked. In any event, we definitely plan on going back, so the 4* are fully deserved.",1
5462,16,4,12/8/2014,"Cocktail was great.Service is top notch.Literally,you buy the ambience,but it's worth every penny.",1
3372,16,4,12/5/2014,"This place is seriously fantastic. Our waiter was REALLY nice but really hard to understand his accent. The food is exceptional. We each had a pasta, shared a salad and a bunch of sides and truly everything was delicious. A place like that to have gluten free pasta AND bread, seriously that's a huge thing. Great vibe, great food.",1
5463,16,5,11/29/2014,"One of my top dining experiences in the city. The host who seated us was actually the bar manager and rolled with the jokes of my date. We had a nice quiet booth. The sommelier visited quickly and helped pick a bottle of wine while I was in the restroom. She told the story over again when I returned as my dining companion was so impressed with the story. Â She sold us at 'hello' essentially. She was great! We ordered the pulpo starter which was so tender and divine! The bisteca and the pasta (tagliolini with leeks, butter and bottarga) ordered for our main were just cooked perfectly. The food is not overly pretentious. It's simple and the flavors all work together to make the perfect bites. The red wine poached pears were a lovely end to the meal... except that they weren't. We had an amaro tasting to end the meal. We will be back again and again!",1
5464,16,5,11/23/2014,"So this past summer the Hubs and I spent a little over a week sampling pasta and pizza from several regions throughout the beautiful country of Italy... as as most I'm sure, I was convinced that once we got back home I wouldn't be able to find a restaurant that could compare to any of the delicious food we had on our trip. And then a rep took me to lunch at Maialino. Â Ohhh Maialino. Â Sei incredibile. From the decor of the restaurant, to the staff, to the food! Â Everything was pretty much perfect.... Our group of four arrived around 1pm (with reservation) to a semi-crowded dining room. Â They've got a combination of booths and tables for whichever size group you're dining with. Â From the moment we sat down I was just loving everything about the place - the beautiful tile floor, that wood beamed ceiling, those large windows flooding the dining room w/ light. Â Maialino is absolutely charming with its rustic touches. But enough about the decor.. lets talk food! Â For lunch each of us opted to try their Prix-Fixe special: antipasto + choice of primo or secondo + dessert = $35 Â  First up for me was a platter of salami and olives. Â I enjoyed each and every slice they put on the plate (I think there were three varieties) and paired them with the delicious bread and olive oil they give to each table. For the main course I selected pasta. Â Cacio e Pepe is a traditional Roman dish and one of the favorites from my trip... Maialino served up an amazzzzing version of the pecorino & black pepper dish. Â Perfectly tender homemade pasta, coated well in the nutty and sharp cheese sauce. Â The sauce wasn't too heavy which made the serving size great. Â Butttt I most definitely could have polished off another bowl. Â So so sooo good! Dessert came around next - when in Italy - errr... when in an Italian restaurant you've got to order gelato or sorbetti! Â Don't even bother arguing w/ me! Â  As part of the prix-fixe we were served the three flavors of the day: vanilla gelato, raspberry sorbetti and white peach sorbetti. Â The vanilla was uber creamy and actually paired amazingly with the raspberry sorbetti. Â Raspberr-cicle anyone? Â Mmmm. Â The raspberry was bursting w/ flavor. Â The white peach was ok. Â Very refreshing but not as powerful as the raspberry. Overall - a fantastic meal at Maialino! Â For a regular ol night out I'd say the place is a little out of my price range but I wouldn't hesitate to take the Hubs here for an anniversary or birthday dinner. Â The food was incredible. Â The service was too. Â The entire experience reminded me of Roma. Â Can't wait to go back!",1
5465,16,4,11/22/2014,"Maialino NY: Manhattan: Gramercy 8:45p Wednesday 19th November 2014 Four Stars My First Online Date. We arrived and there was an hour and fifteen minute wait. So we went to the rose bar to talk and wait. Â After exact 1:15 wait, they texted us that our table was ready. We sat in quiet corner. Â To my surprise, my date was a vegan. Luckily she scoped the place out to make sure she could eat here. Â I avoided Suckling Pig Terrine and any other off putting menu items. We let the waitress bring us a few glasses of italian red which were dry, less fruity, and tannic. Â She ate the bread without asking if it contain animal products so I was relieved to know that she was not an extremist. She taught me that not all wine is vegan since wine producers use fish bladder to clarify wine. She had the Cavatelli with White Beans, Escarole & Rosemary without cheese. Â I had the Lamb Ragu which came with a white sauce. The Tagiatelle was well cooked. (there's no picture since I didn't want to make a bad impression and show my truly asian side). Overall, the date was great: Interesting Conversation, Nice Atmosphere, and Delicious Food. I am not sure if there is anything romantic connection but I will have to wait and see.",1
5466,16,4,11/18/2014,I like the feel of this restaurant. The food was good and the setup was very accommodating for my large group.,1
5467,16,5,11/16/2014,"The best brunch in the city! Nothing is better than the Cacio e Pepe eggs. They are light and fluffy almost like an oatmeal consistency with a great peppery flavor. The potato skin sides are equally delicious and sprinkled with Parmesan. However, the real standout here is the service. I went for brunch yesterday and my friend got carsick from a bumpy cab ride. She couldn't eat her meal at all. The waitress kindly brought her homemade ginger ale and bent over backwards to help my friend feel better. Unfortunately we had to end the meal quickly. Shockingly, they didn't charge my friend for her meal or ginger ale. I was so impressed with this kind and unnecessary gesture. If the manager is reading this, the waitress (whose name I wish I had gotten) is a true gem. I will certainly be back.",1
5468,16,4,11/14/2014,"Wonderful ambience and great vibe. We walked in on an early Saturday evening (6ish), and our party of three were accommodated after a relatively short wait. The wine recommendations were excellent. Our salumi sampler was perfect to tide three ladies' appetites over whilst waiting for our pasta orders. I got the vongole. The clams were well cooked and the pasta awesome. However, I found my dish a little too salty for my taste. Nothing munching on a little more bread and sipping wine won't solve. By the time we were done, we had no room for dessert. Oh well, maybe on my next visit.",1
5469,16,5,11/14/2014,"My wife and I ate at Maialino last week, and we were impressed with all aspects of this place. Â Every plate that arrived, from the lightly fried and extremely fresh artichokes to the spicy bucatani, was a study of well-prepared simple ingredients cooked to perfection. Â What really stood out, however, was the exceptional service. Â The sommalier was happy to recommend a great bold red under $60 from the massive wine list (with no disdainful airs), and the server was friendly and pleasant in a way that was actually additive. Â While it's a nice place, it was also great to see a family with small children dining nearby. Â It's a place that comfortable with itself - as are its diners - where you can get a greal meal in a casual vibe.",1
5470,16,3,11/11/2014,"This restaurant was actually very beautiful, overlooking the Irving place park with a lot of greenery. It was also attached to a hotel so the atmosphere was quite fancy and chic. I came late, meeting my friends as they ordered for me. When I got there, I tried the bread with the crystal salt. Very interesting combination! I had the porchetta sandwich and a couple of us shared the pastry basket. We were anticipating the pastry basket first but it looked like they forgot about it as we had to ask them about it. Service was also painfully slow...with the waitress misinforming us on what was inside the pastry basket...seemed a little inattentive for such a nice restaurant. I felt like the porchetta sandwich was also missing something as well. The eggs over easy were actually really good but I felt like they could've added more pepper or a little flavor as the sandwich was a little lacking....although I did like the arugula that went with it. Overall, it didn't really impress and don't know if I would come back...many more places to try!",1
2258,16,3,11/10/2014,"3.5/5 for me here I have been here a while ago before my Yelping days for dinner, but this time around we just popped in on a Sunday evening and found the place absolutely packed around 8pm. Â We were surprised how busy it was, but were content with heading over to the bar for some drinks and desserts. Â I would recommend a reservation before you get here, and apparently even if you are considering a night cap on a Sunday evening. The atmosphere is very rustic but more chic casual? if that is even a thing. Â The wooden tables in the entrance are great and there are plenty of options for seating at the big bar as well. Â The bartenders are on point with recommendations and were friendly throughout our experience. Â We ended up doing a wine and digestive along with a couple of desserts and espressos (not impressed with these), all of which was moderately priced. We tried the cranberry crostata with pumpkin ice cream that was perfectly crafted to not be so overpowering on the ""pumpkin spice"" and the components all worked well here - screamed autumn. Â We also did the buddino of chocolate cake that was the opposite and just a very rich mouuse like cake that was also good. Â I look forward to going back for the full menu. Buon appetito.",1
5471,16,5,11/7/2014,"I thought this place was excellent. It's a nice little gem in the heart of Gramercy with a very warm and cozy ambiance accompanied by friendly staff. I went there for breakfast and had their poached eggs, with two sides: bruschetta, and a tomato dish. It was extremely delicious, the presentation was on-point and the meal was very filling. I haven't been there for lunch or dinner, but am definitely looking forward to it.",1
5472,16,4,11/5/2014,"The concept of pasta al dente had been lost on me for many years and came back in all its splendor at Maialino. Went for the simple Spaghettini con le Acciughe: butter, Garlic and anchovies. Simple and perfect.",1
4383,16,5,11/3/2014,"The BEST pasta in the city! Recommendations: Pasta pasta pasta! 1. Bucatini all'Amatriciana - closest flavors to Rome in NYC so far. The guanciale is perfect. The sauce could use a little more of a kick in my opinion, and the noodles slightly more al dente. But, nevertheless, NEAR PERFECTION. 2. Malfatti - one of our favorites on the menu. I would say a must get! 3. Carbonara - light and delicious! Guanciale ... need I say more? 4. Linguine Vongole - you can taste the quality olive oil in this. And fresh herbs. It's not salty like other Linguine w/white clam sauces... this one is light and perfect! and... if they have a white truffle special when it's in season... GET IT!! :)",1
2785,16,5,11/3/2014,"Fantastic! My parents were in town and we came here with no reservations on a Friday night. We were seated by the bar area after about 15 minutes. The cocktails here are small but very good. We opted for the 4 course family style menu and it did not disappoint. It's pricier, 75 bucks a person, but we were absolutely stuffed at the end. The first two courses were small appetizers, about three different ones to try. The main course we had chosen the suckling pig which is what the restaurant is known for. Two giant sides came out with two big pig sections. There were three of us but we couldn't finish the main section. When dessert came, we were expecting maybe two things to try from but they ended up bringing out four different desserts. It was a great choice to try a lot of the specialties and a good part of the menu. I would definitely come back.",1
5473,16,4,11/3/2014,"My husband and I walked in without a reservation at 5:30-ish on a Saturday night and were seated right away (at a table, not at the bar). We ordered the fried artichokes, fluke crudo, and he ate the suckling pig face (I could not bring myself to do so, but he said it was great). We also ordered the carbonara, which did not arrive--they brought us the cacio e pepe pasta instead, by accident. While they were very apologetic--and offered to comp us the mistaken pasta and bring the correct one--it was a bit annoying because it had taken a while for the pasta to arrive. We ended up just cancelling the carbonara because we had a movie to catch, and they ended up charging us for the cacio e pepe and we paid for it because we were running late. So: food was really good--the cacio e pepe was excellent, too--but service was spotty. I would go back, but maybe try to get a different waitress, perhaps one who writes down the order.",1
5474,16,4,10/22/2014,"Came for brunch when 5 of us were turned away from another neighborhood restaurant (Casa Mono) Â that refused to seat us at a 6 top or even a 4 top and 2 top that Â were right next to each other. Really??? Anyway even though Maialino was quite full they did find a place for us after a short wait. Our server Stephanie was wonderful, knowledable and patient. The five of us were from all over the country and celebrating. Wanted to start with fancy cocktails then wine. Wine came out first and the bar was so busy that it did take a long time for the cocktails, really too long as we were Â done with our apps and had started on the wine. I was the only one that didn't like my entree - carbonara. Overly peppered and the guaniciale was so undercooked that I had to eat around it. Fat is fine when it is crispy, but not raw. The lemon ricotta pancakes someone else had were heaven as were the 2 desserts we shared. Poached pears and a littke chocolate thing, sorry can't remember the name.",1
5475,16,2,10/21/2014,"I had been looking forward to this dinner for over a month as I planned a visit to NYC. Perhaps I set my expectations too high leading me to be feel underwhelmed with my meal and service. I will say, the maitre d' was extremely kind and I enjoyed speaking with the sommelier who came over to discuss the wine list. However, our server was quite mediocre and the timing between plates was incredibly slow (not the server's fault per se). As for the food, I am the ultimate pasta lover, carbonara being one of my favorites, but at Maialino, I couldn't even finish half of my plate. Â The guanciale overpowered the pasta with smokiness, making it taste like a one note dish. I definitely think my homemade carbonara (from Cook's Illustrated) blows the Maialino version out of the water. I also ordered the chittarra pasta, described as Spicy Tomato, Braised Pork Skin, Pecorino & Oregano, but to me this tasted like spaghetti doused in a four dollar bottle of arrabiata sauce. My friend's Bucatini all'Amatriciana was the best dish of pasta on the table, but again, was nothing to write home about. My favorite part of the meal had to be the generous portion of crisp, succulent brussels spouts, we enjoyed as a side. I absolutely love Danny Meyer's restaurants but I don't think I'll return to Maialino.",1
5476,16,5,10/20/2014,"This place is A+ from top to bottom. We were a party of 2 adults and 4 children aged 8 - 11 yrs. The service was friendly, accommodating (they gladly improvised a simplified pasta dish for the kids), and unpretentious. Our server was knowledgeable about the wine list and recommended a really delicious red to go with our meal. Mother ordered one of the house-concocted cocktails, and let me tell you - it was astounding! Absolutely fantastic and unlike anything I have ever tasted in the way of alcoholic beverages. Can't say enough about that one. The food was also top-notch. I ordered the suckling pig face on arugula which was very simple and rustic (as it should be). We also had one of the bleu cheese plates and some house-made pate. Delicious! This was such an enjoyable evening in every way. Highly recommend. It ain't cheap, but you will not go away regretting the spend.",1

She suggested a great wine pairing for our courses. Our meal was very tasty and the dessert at the end was the perfect size and perfect amount of sweet. The environment of the restaurant is great, too and doesn't require you to be dressy to dine there. I can't wait for another occasion to go there.",1
5478,16,5,10/17/2014,Wonderful breakfast and brunch spot. Â Awesome espresso bar and long tables for reading the paper at breakfast. Â The pepper and pecorino eggs are so great at breakfast!,1
5479,16,5,10/16/2014,"One of my favorite local spots, and I'm not alone. The food here is delicious and well balanced, and reasonably priced for what you're getting. It's a very specific New York take on Italian. There's a great wine list, focused on.. Well, Italians. Cocktails are superb. The vibe is well balanced - like a friend once said, 'laid back fine dining'. The bar is a friendly spot, first come first serve, runs an efficient list. For weekends and in general, if you want to sit down in the main area, I'd call a few days in advance to reserve. They always have room for walk ins but the wait can be as long as one or two hours.",1

I only go for dinner, I take their wine recommendations, and I always order the same thing (until they removed it from the menu - seasonal maybe?). Â I rarely make reservations, although I hear it's recommended. Â A few months ago, I walked toward Maialino after work with plans to grab an impromptu bite, only to find the entire restaurant blocked off by police cars. Â I asked the officers what was so important that it kept me from having a quick dinner by the bar, and they responded ""Obama is in there."" Â So there you go - proof of Maialino's president-worthy menu and ambience, yet down-to-earth enough for ""normal folks"" like me. Bring your family, bring your friends, try the: cavatelli, brussels sprouts, and ask for wine recommendations.",1
1575,16,1,10/12/2014,"Overall very disappointing brunch. It took twenty minutes to get menus and only after some prodding. Another twenty before someone came for our order (again prodding necessary). And then our food - which didn't come unusually quickly - beat out our coffee order. As for the food, I couldn't imagine a pork sandwich having any less flavor. The atmosphere is nice, but for the price, you'd expect it.",1
5203,16,5,10/11/2014,so so good. this place is a real hit. we have been here for brunch and dinner. everything is just so good. from service to food it's 5 stars. the dishes seem so simple yet are so delicious with obvious attention to detail and using what seems like multiple components. everything we ordered was almost better then the next. most recently we went to celebrate a birthday and it was the perfect place. doesn't hurt that you can roam around gramercy park after your meal wishing you had that magic key while reminiscing about that amazing dining experience.,1

5483,16,4,10/3/2014,"I've been to Maialino six times now. It used to be a five star restaurant but I will rate it a four for all of the great meals that I've had in the past. I'm pretty sure Nick is no longer in the kitchen. My fiancÃ© and I shared an order of the Malfatti. It was only good. It used to be an excellent pasta dish. They now offer an individual serving of the Maialino al Forno. The suckling pig skin was nice and crispy and the meat was moist and tender. While it was very good, it is now served with the super salty pan juices along with the roasted potatoes. The current chef should consider draining this dish before sending it out. It makes the potatoes almost inedible. My fiancÃ© ordered the pan roasted Halibut and found the tomato broth to be too salty. I didn't taste it. The olive oil cake was moist and great tasting as usual. They used to serve an amazing Uovo Raviolo years ago. I wish they would put it back on the menu. Now I have to go to the terrible SD26 in order to get something similar. Service was great. The only complaint of the night was that it was unreasonably cold in the restaurant last night. Not chilly, but meat freezer frigid. Next stop: Marta.",1
5484,16,5,10/3/2014,Perfection. Perfectly al dente and seasoned Tonarelli a Cacio e Pepe paired with a great sicilian wine and bread = a happy camper.,1
5485,16,5,9/29/2014,"Four stars average over hundreds of reviews, I think this says it all. Â We came here the first time last week and had a great meal. Â From the staff at the front and at the bar to our waiter and sommelier they are the best staff I have ever seen. Â  The food is excellent and I would recommend trusting your waiter, it they recommend something trust them, you won't be disappointed, we were not. Â The octopus appetizer and the kale salad were great, the ravioli pasta with shaved truffle was exceptional and worth the indulgence. Â We had the salt crusted fish for two which was the best fish we've had in recent memory. Â  Wine list was nice, a good selection and in sizes (glass, small pitcher, bottle) that accommodates most diners capacity. Did I mention our excellent waiter?....",1
5486,16,2,9/22/2014,"Left a bad taste in my mouth--literally! Not only was the service poor and very slow--with the waiter forgetting to bring one of the appetizers and then disappearing so it was hard to get the missing item--but the food was quite mediocre to poor. The fried artichoke appetizer was fairly good, but the saltibocca di pollo had an unpleasant oily, smoky flavor that overpowered all of the ingredients. Tasted like the food had been doused with liquid smoke or something similar. I was unable to eat some of the dessert biscotti because they tasted like someone had put salt instead of sugar. Given all the excellent reviews, I can't understand why my friends and I got such a poor meal--for a rather high price. And that oily, smoky flavor is still in my mouth hours later.",1

1794,16,2,9/15/2014,"Review for Sunday brunch. Â Reservation is highly recommended. Â It is packed at 1.30pm on Sunday. Â We were seated promptly which was a good start. And then things started going downhill from there. Â My friend, due to dietary restriction, wanted almond milk with her coffee. Â There is actually a latte with almond milk on the menu but she prefers just a simple iced coffee with almond milk. Â She ended up with just iced coffee with no almond milk at sight. Â  And then we moved on to the menu. Â I had the porchetta sandwich. Â It was pretty darn good. Â The pork tastes like it is salt cured and melts in your mouth. Â The runny egg provides a good sauce for the sandwich. Â $16 is a little steep. Â I was hoping I will dream about it but so far I've been forgetting about it. And then the dessert. Â We ordered the chocolate panna cotta. Â When the order arrived, I see no sign of chocolate. Â It was a vanilla panna cotta. Â We have up at that point. Our server was nice and was apologetic about the whole iced coffee situation. Â I expect an impeccable execution from a Danny Meyer restaurant but this experience was even below par of an average restaurant.",1
5488,16,4,9/12/2014,"Wow! Â This place was great. Restaraunt was nicely appointed staff was friendly and service was very good. We got the heirloom caprese salad and grilled octopus to start. Both were very good. The octopus came with a tomatoe sauce on it that I could have done without. I thought it masked some of the flavor of the dish. It was still good just not my preference. For dinner we had the lobster spaghetti which had a 1/2 of lobster in it. It was incredible. We also had the large ravioli with ricotta and a easy egg yolk in the middle. That was also very good. Dessert was just ok I thought. We had chocolate gelato with cherries as shaved chocolate. It was a lot of chocolate on one dish for me. Also got a blackberry tart with corn gelato. Yes I said corn gelato. Some things should not be turned into gelato. An ice cream dish that tastes like corn is not something that sounded appetizing, but had to try it. I was right. Â Tastes like cold corn. Not good, but now I know. Wine list was extensive and is set up by region. Areas of Italy I had never heard of along with varietals I had not seen or tasted before. They only offer Italian wines, but after a quick chat with sommelier she recommended a great bottle at an affordable price (under $80). I was shocked that she did this and I appreciated her not trying to steer us to a more expensive bottle when we were unsure with the selection in the first place. Â I would definitely recommend reservations as the place was packed and it was a Thurs.",1
1742,16,3,9/6/2014,"Sat in the bar room dining area with a friend on a weekday at 12pm--no wait. Â Best part of the meal was her spicy tripe and pecorino appetizer... tripe was so tender and tasty! Â Everything else was okay (had the fried artichoke, hanger steak, and panna cotta). Â Perhaps should try some more unique options next time.",1
5489,16,5,9/5/2014,"There are already 749 reviews of this place here yet I feel compelled to add another. I just had lunch there and oh myyyyy goodness, it was so good.

5490,16,5,9/3/2014,"Maialino's food is amazing, especially their pastas! My friend ordered the maialino and loved it as well. I would say the food is worth going, but their staff isn't as friendly as I thought they would be, seeing it is a USHG restaurant. Nonetheless, the service and food were amazing!",1
5491,16,1,8/30/2014,This is a restaurant that confirms everything I have always thought about hotel restaurants. Â Mediocre at best. Â  While the service and smiles were ever present the real food experience was completely missing. Â Lamb chops were what I would expect at a greek dinner and the veal breast was so dry it was like cardboard. I think my 818 area code confused the staff and we were seated in a booth that was presented to us like a gift from the heavens. Â In reality it was in the cow path between the bar and kitchen. Â Dreary really. If you are a Danny Meyers fan stick to shake shake.,1
5492,16,5,8/30/2014,"Wow what customer service! My boyfriend and I had 9 o'clock reservation, and by 9:15 while we were still waiting for our table, they comp'd us drinks at the bar. Despite being seated a little after 9:30, service was impeccable. Although we chose not to order dessert, our waiter came out with 3 delicious desserts on the house. When our bill arrived we were even more amazed! They took care of all of our drinks for the night and brought us a bag filled with muffins and cinnamon buns for breakfast the next morning. Best costumer service we have ever experienced! We will definitely be returning.",1
4404,16,3,8/25/2014,"KenScale: 7.5/10 Maialino is Roman-style trattoria from restaurateur Danny Meyer at Gramercy Park Hotel. It has long been one of those hip spots in the city where a lot of young people hang out, with not-so-occasional opportunities for celebrity sighting (even President Obama made a visit once). While I really liked the vibe of the restaurant, I'm not sure I am entirely sold on food. Granted, I had always visited Maialino for brunch and never for dinner, which tends to show the full range of what a kitchen can do. At least for the brunch, though, I've been to better places. I shared a couple of starters. I liked the tasty bites of both Suppli al Telefono (tomato risotto croquettes and mozzarella) and bruschetta (with ricotta, hazelnuts and honey). The croquettes were really crispy, and I was a fan of crunchy hazelnuts working together with ricotta. I ordered tonnarelli a cacio e pepe pasta (with pecorino and black pepper) for main dish, and wasn't impressed. The dish was a bit too greasy and didn't display enough spicy kick that I expected from pepper. I stole a bite from my dining companions for some of their sandwiches too. Both porchetta (roast pork and fried egg sandwich) and panino di pancetta (house cured pancetta, heirloom tomatoes and escarole) were well executed, but neither of them stood out in terms of flavor or texture. As I noted above, the restaurant is a really charmer you normally associate with a hip place to hang out. Getting a reservation during dinner time is still quite a challenge, but it's much easier to get a table during lunch/brunch hours. The restaurant has a full bar with a mix of cocktail and wine menus. I will definitely try Maialino for dinner at some point (it has certainly been known for its rustic cuisine featuring nose-to-tail style meaty dishes). Maybe my underwhelming experience in terms of food had more to do with the inherent limitation of brunch in general than the kitchen's quality. We'll see.",1
5493,16,4,8/24/2014,"Great place for Italian in the city. Good food and service can be counted on at this reasonably priced , for NYC, restaurant. Located right next to Gramercy Park and in the Gramercy Park Hotel, it is a great place for a group dinner or a couples night out. Pasta is super fresh. Good wine list.",1
2503,16,5,8/24/2014,"A very tough place to get in, and you can immediately figure out why. The food here is super tasty and very different to the usual Italian restaurant in Manhattan. Can't even remember what we ate, but can remember that everything we had was great.",1
5494,16,5,8/22/2014,"This may be my all-time favorite restaurant in New York City. Everything, from the food to the service to the decor, is done with the most refined yet understated elegance. I have been here at least 8 times (with parents, dates, boyfriends, girlfriends, really anyone) and each time, I have had the same unparalled experience. Some gripe about how difficult it is to get a reservation at a good hour here - indeed, it is difficult. I don't bother anymore. But, if you're with a small party, 3 or 2, there are tables near the front reserved for walk-ins, in addition to seating at the bar. Put your name in with the always cheerful and accommodating host and go for a walk around the neighborhood, which alone is entertainment, for 20 minutes. You'll be seated in no time, or take a seat at the spacious bar - the bartenders are delightful, and the cocktail and wine lists are extensive without being cumbersome. The space is also unique by New York standards. While I typically enjoy small, cozy restaurants, Maialino's spacious, uncluttered dining room is a welcome reprieve from having to yell over your table to converse (or climbing over/under it to use the restroom). I took my 65+ parents here, and they particularly enjoyed the lively yet approachable atmosphere. I feel strongly that while tasteful, the decor is unassuming - you have to make a point to notice it - and I think that this is a testament to the more important elements of the restaurant, the food and the staff, which outshine anything hanging from the wall. Finally, the food, any and all of it, is positively, unequivocally divine. Heaven on earth, I saw the light, blacked out, came back to life and pinched myself to confirm I was still mortal. That's how I feel everytime I eat here. Some of my favorites include the carciofini fritti (fried artichoke hearts - very lightly crispy), insalata (sometimes it changes - whatever it is, usually arugula with parmesan with a light lemony dressing, it always good), malfatti (house specialty - braised suckling pig and arugula) and bucatini all'Amatriciana. I usually alternate between the malfatti and bucatini. The malfatti will melt in your mouth, and the serving size is perfect - you always want to keep eating more of it, but it is frankly too rich to eat more. Bucatini all'Amatriciana is one of my favorite pasta dishes in general, and Maialino does a textbook perfect version of it. The sauce is spicy, hearty and seeps into the hollow noodles just so, resulting in the most epic, food-induced orgasm you'll ever have, so that's nice. I could go on and on, the secondi, the dessert, the wine! But it would take ages, and my mouth is watering. For the record, I try very hard to not repeat restaurants too often, but I have no qualms about returning here every few weeks. None.",1
5495,16,5,8/21/2014,"Well I am late to the party with my review for this restaurant but dont worry its a good one!! It was the last day I heard of this ramen week they were having. They were serving ""Roman Ramen"" at the bar and I had to get it! So I made my bf leave work early from Queens and come take me!! It was so worth it! Lol This restaurant is nestled on the side of a beautiful hotel. Â When walking in we were greeted by the nicest host which seated us promptly. We were seated near the bar at a by huge window. Thank god we came when we did because less then a half hour later the place was packed with an hour wait! Although we knew what we were here for, we looked over the menu which was a bad idea. Or was it? Our one dish order became a large tasting of multiple dishes! Â We ordered the: Polpette di lupo which was veggi meatballs. One of the best I ever tried. With a delicious tomato sauce and a ton a Parmesan cheese atop. Amazing i couldn't get enough! Roman Ramen a delicious italian ramen with faro noodles, porchetta, arugula, soft boiled egg, celery salt to taste, in a chicken and veal broth was something I was so delighted to have. Probably something I will only get one time in my life. Very inventive and the one thing I went here for. Â It def didnt disappoint. We also ordered pork ribs with roasted potatoes this was also good but a lil messy. The meat fell off the bones. Which was so good. We finally ended our meal with olive oil cake and choc chip bread pudding which was amazing. And Capp and coffee which came out as a French press. Â Olive oil cake was scented with orange. It was moist and although you would think it would be greasy it wasn't. Â The bread pudding was rich and and rounded out the meal. The ice cream was a great compliment. This restaurant is one I would frequent often and it is reasonably priced. Def go check this place out",1
5496,16,4,8/19/2014,"After much hype, finally made it out to Maialino for dinner. First and foremost, you absolutely need to make a reservation or you can forget about getting in . I was only able to get a time through American Express as OpenTable didn't have any dinner seating for the week. The restaurant has has an intimate set up, yet is very upbeat. You immediately get the feeling that you're going to have a meal that will be reflective of the atmosphere. There's a nice size bar to booze it up while you wait for your table and they have some really good drinks that they make. Lots of great wine and champagne selections. Once we were seated, they brought over a delicious bread basked that almost filled me up before dinner. Definitely one of the best bread baskets I've ever had. For appetizers, I started out with the friend crab legs. I have to say, I love crab but this dish didn't really do it for me. It was my first time eating my crab fried, so I think the fried version just isn't for me. For the main course I had the slowed cooked pork special, which is the dish they're known for. It was delicious. Juicy, tender and full of flavor. Also had a nice crisp to it which topped it off perfectly. The only issue was the dish was very salty. Pork dishes are always a little more salty than others, but this was a little too much so. Service was fast and attentive as we didn't have to wait long whenever we wanted anything. Waiters also were great about really explaining each dish in detail. Overall it was a greats dinning experience. Atmosphere is awesome and food is very good. Not the absolutely mind blowing experience I've heard about, but very very good.",1
5497,16,3,8/18/2014,"Went for brunch. Pasta cheese and pepper (cacio e pepe) is overrated. I didn't like the texture of the pasta. The brioche toffee bun was so good though! Warm toffee, I wish I could have bought some to go. Poached eggs were also good. Service was also lacking with forgotten items and things not coming at the same time.",1
5498,16,2,8/18/2014,"I am SO disappointed. My sister, a 20yr New Yorker brought me here. She had been here before and thought I'd love it. I missed my train and we missed our reservation, but showed up and were told the wait would be 30 - 45 minutes. We went to the bar, were greeted with fantastically friendly staff. They recommended a wine that was fabulous. We were seated, I'd say within 20 minutes. We ordered the Caprese salad and olives. They forget the olives and there was a lot of salt on the salad, but it was still good. Next we ordered the Carbonara. The guanciale was epic, it was crispy and delicious, but the pasta was almost inedible with the amount of salt. Lastly we ordered the special slow cooked pork and potatoes that they are famous for. The pork was one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. BUT the potatoes were again so salty I couldn't eat them. All in all, I might go back for drinks and appetizers but not for a meal.",1
5499,16,4,8/18/2014,"Why it's worth it: Maialino's bustling ambiance, solid repertoire of Roman dishes and backing from one of the world's best restaurateurs, Danny Meyer, makes it a perfect choice for any special occasion (whether your parents are in town or it's a friend's birthday). Vibe: Maialino explores the Roman trattoria feel with a country-style interior that elicits a casual yet trendy vibe. When you walk into the well-lit restaurant you notice the wood furnishings, the plaid dining table clothes and the large bay window view of Gramercy Park. Layout: This restaurant has open bar seating facing Gramercy Park, rectangular tables for intimate dining and circular tables for larger parties of 5 or 6. Ideal meal: To start: Prosciutto e Mozzarella (Salumi) ($17) and Carciofini Fritti (fried artichokes and lemon) (Antipasta) ($14) To dine: Tonnarelli a cacio e pepe (pecorino and black pepper) (Primi) ($16) and Pesce alla Piastra (seared cobia and braised celery) (Secondi) ($29) To add: Funghi Trifolati (mushrooms, white wine & anchovy) (Contorni) To indulge: Torta di Olio d'Oliva (Olive oil cake with vanilla bean marscapone) ($8), Assorted Cookies ($8), Gelati e Sorbetti (three scoops) ($9) On a budget: Carciofini Fritti, Tonnarelli a cacio e pepe, Torta di Olio d'Oliva F.Y.I.: In English, Maialino means Little Pig, which makes sense considering they are known for their suckling pig. Make a reservation! If you can, make it at least 2 weeks in advance.

His other restaurants include Gramercy Tavern and Blue Smoke.",1
4329,16,4,8/17/2014,"Maialino looks very imposing from the outside but once you've entered, the staff is warm and inviting as well as the ambience. It feels surprisingly casual and cosy for such a well known restaurant. I came for RW summer 2014. For appetizer, I had the prosciutto with melon which was very fresh and tasty. For the entree, I had the malfatti which was bursting with flavor. I was happy that it came with pasta so I could try that too as well as the pig. My mom had the steak which was cooked perfectly medium rare and had a nice crispy crust to it. The desserts were stunning too. I loved the lemon pudding budino and the olive oil cake was good too. The service was very attentive and polite, but definitely be prepared for a meal on the slower side.",1
3092,16,5,8/16/2014,"Maialino is a very, very good restaurant. They do a lot of things right that you would want in a Roman style trattoria in NYC. Â They keep the spirit of the cuisine in an elegant, but comfortable setting. I'd heard a lot of about the carbonara and it does live up to the hype as one of the best I've had. Â The use of guanciale was fantastic as it added a smoky, salty element to the rich dish. Â  I also had a chance to try the parpadelle, the Panino Indiavolato, and sample the pastries as well. Â Everything was delicious. It's one of my wife's favorite restaurants in the city and an easy choice for a go-to restaurant with friends.",1

5501,16,3,8/14/2014,"It pains a little bit to give Maialino 3-stars but I have to be honest here... I decided to come here for my 22nd birhday, which is a big deal. I'm super selective (especially when someone else is footing the bill, thanks fam!) I've wanted to go forever, read so many awesome reviews, blah blah. Anyways, I'm cringing a little as I write, but here goes. The service was outstanding. Super friendly waitstaff and excellent sommelier who knew exactly what I was hoping for when she recommended a reasonably priced Montepulciano. Truly delicious red wine. The decor and ambiance are warm and cozy. It is well decorated and not too loud, which I appreciated. The crowd is mostly in their 30s and 40s, with some people that are more senior. And now, for the food. The bread basket was on point, and I love the maldon salt on the table. The portions are too small. Fried artichokes were quite tasty, but why was there no dip or sauce for them? God, I just dreamt of a tangy yogurt to dunk the hot crisy leaves into. The insalata was leaves dressed in evoo and lemon juice. Tasty, nothing special. Salumi misti was $17 and barely 9 pieces of very, very thinly sliced prosicutto, finocchiona and sopressata. Everything was good, nothing was outstanding. For our main, we kept it super kosher and ordered the Maialino (roasted suckling pig) for the table. It comes with roasted potatoes which were definitely too salty b/c they absorbed all the porky sauce. The pig portion is enough to feed 3-4 comfortably. Don't order it if you're just with one other person, unless you want to go into cardiac arrest. The skin was very crispy, and the meat executed perfectly. I enjoyed it. We also got a strozzapretti pasta which came with some sort of raisin almond pesto. It was al dente but the sauce was a little clunky and lacked acid. Again, it was totally fine but nothing to rave about. The real downfall was dessert, which was bad across the board. I have a huge sweet tooth and like all desserts, but all 3 i tried were not good. I ordered tartufo, which usually is many layers of getalo. This one was just a giant scoop of chocolate ice cream with some rock solid frozen cherries in the middle. My mom got blackberry crostata and it was under cooked. The dough was soggy and we left most of it untouched and sitting in a pool of the strange, melted corn gelato. Also tried the lime sorbet, and the grapefruit sorbet. Both were fine but so tart I puckered eating one spoonful. 3 stars for our appetizers and main course meal, +1 for amazing service, -1 for dessert",1

Our server was friendly and engaging -- and strangely calm, considering it was a madhouse because of Restaurant Week. The food was fantastic. Appetizer - Prosciutto and melon: How can you go wrong? Thinly sliced prosciutto with super ripe, sweet cantaloupe. Entree - Pappardelle with pork ragu: Pasta was the perfect thickness and perfectly cooked. And that pork ragu... I nearly licked the plate clean. Dessert - Gelato and sorbet trio: Blueberry gelato, peach sorbet, and raspberry sorbet. It was a hefty portion of gelato/sorbet, some real-sized ice scream scoops! The blueberry gelato tasted just like blueberries and cream, and the sorbets tasted like bites of ripe summer fruit. Oh, and did I mention there were $6 glasses of wine for Restaurant Week? I was such a happy, happy girl. I will return for the legendary pancetta one day.",1
5503,16,5,8/12/2014,Their mozzarella with prosciutto is amazing. The spicy tomato sauce pasta is crazy good too!,1
5504,16,5,8/12/2014,"Great Italian restaurant in NYC, and to top it off, in one of my favorite neighborhoods in Manhattan, Gramercy Park. The restaurant has a cool Italian countryside decor to it and the service was very good. We went during restaurant week, but looking at the regular menu, you pretty much get the same price except they're throwing in a free dessert. So the prices are pretty reasonable for such a nice place with great food. Beef carpaccio was amazing. Bursting with flavor. My only complaint was that the portion on it was a bit small, but hey, it's an appetizer and it's carpaccio...can't expect a 16 oz steak out of it. The aged sliced sirloin over white bean salad was fantastic as well. Lemon panna cotta was REALLY lemony, which I like, but some might find it a bit too much. Forgot the name of the glass of rose that I got, but it was so good I ended up ordering another. Stumbled out of there feeling happy and full...yeah I know, I'm a light weight...two glasses of wine and I got tipsy! Oh, and the bread basket was very very good. Focaccia was prob my favorite, we had them refill out bread basket 2 times it was so good!",1
5505,16,5,8/10/2014,"Came here for brunch. No tables, but they welcomed us to sit at the beautiful solid wood bar. I had the Cacio e Pepe (Soft scrambled eggs w/pecorino and black pepper) with a side of Pomodori (Marinated tomatoes with market herbs and olive oil), and some thick cut pancetta. It was one of the best brunches I've had in my life. I can whole heartedly recommend this restaurant to anybody.",1
5506,16,4,8/7/2014,Came for restaurant week lunch and went with the $35 menu option. Started with the Insalata di capresi which was delicious but tiny. Chose the malfatti for my entree.

5509,16,5,7/28/2014,"This is my favorite restaurant in New York City. I know, that's a bold statement. But I truly feel that everything they do here is understated perfection. It's fine dining without going over the top. It's not cheap, but it's not unaffordable. It feels like home here. You don't feel like you're in a super pretentious white table cloth place. You can wear jeans and be casual but you could also get dressed up and come here for an extra special evening. The ambience is just perfect. Service is super friendly without being too friendly. I also love that walk-ins are very welcome. I hate making reservations. I never know what I'm going to feel like eating weeks in advance. Actually, I've never made a reservation here and the longest I've waited was 30 minutes. It's never been an issue. Now, the food. The bread and olive oil they give you to start is amazing. When I'm extra hungry and they offer to bring more it makes me very happy. Every single pasta I've had here was absolutely delicious. The ideal portion size, too. Some places like Bar Primi (no disrespect) give you the tiniest portion of pasta. This is a happy medium. My favorites are the bucatini and the tortelli with pork and chicken liver and balsamic. The best one I had was a Spaghetti special, with lobster. It's not on the menu but apparently appears quite frequently on their daily specials, so if it's there, you have to try it. It's in a rich, buttery tomato sauce, with pieces of poached lobster tail. Enough said. I also love how seasonal their menu is. I feel like many Italian restaurants don't incorporate seasonality into their menu enough. They do it in a very elegant, not over-the-top trying to be a farm-to-table restaurant way. Maialino is effortlessly perfect! They are more than deserving of five stars.",1
5510,16,5,7/28/2014,"I had been wanting to go to Maialino for so long now, having tried other Danny Meyer ventures. He's done it again here - vast wine selection, incredible food at reasonable prices, and impeccable service. This is a surprisingly affordable place for dinner. The pasta is heavenly, perfectly cooked and dressed. On a Friday night the space was packed with large groups and smaller tables. Despite how loud it is with everyone enjoying themselves, it is possible to have a conversation with your table. Would definitely come back!",1

5513,16,5,7/21/2014,"I already knew Maialino would be wonderful due to the difficulty I had getting a lunch reservation for a reasonable time. My friend and I settled on a late lunch at 1:45. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated and sat at the bar while we waited. The decor here is rustic comfortable casual. The staff was friendly and attentive. I love to take advantage of New York's restaurant week, but sometimes a restaurant can be a hit or a miss. Maialino's restaurant week had a wonderful variety and some interesting choices. They also have a $35 prifixe lunch menu that I believe they have all the time. For the appetizer I got the Melanzane (marinated eggplants, ricotta and Sicilian anchovies). I love all things eggplant and the combination of the flavors paired nicely! For the entree both my girlfriend and I ordered the Saltimbocca di pollo (Chicken leg cutlet with Sage and prosciutto). The chicken leg cutlet was cooked to perfection with a crispy skin and on a bed of spinach and pine nuts. The portion sizes were great for lunch and we were both happy that with the lack of carbs we didn't feel weighed down after eating. For dessert I ordered the Torta di Olio d'Oliva (Olive Oil cake with vanilla bean marscapone). I thought that it sounded like an extremely interesting combination of flavors. The end result was pleasant, the olive oil flavor was subtle (and not too sweet) and the rich marscapone complimented it well. Again the service was really wonderful as our water glasses were never even half empty and dishes were promptly cleared away. All in all I would love to return to try out more dishes in the future!",1
5514,16,4,7/20/2014,"I went to Maialino today for brunch for the first time, and now I'm trying to figure out when to come back. I sat at the bar, which has a lovely view of Gramercy Park. The cacio e pepe eggs are creamy, rich, and utterly decadent. I ordered the contadina (poached eggs on corn Roth jalapeÃ±o), which balanced savory and sweet. The corn was excellent. My friend and I split the olive oil muffin. It's oily so half was enough, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The walk in area gets really busy by 12:15 pm. I recommend getting there earlier so you can snag a seat with a park view at the bar.",1
5515,16,5,7/19/2014,"Expansive wine selection and unpretentious fare. It's the type of place you'll miss coming to after losing your job in the next recession. Temperature in the restaurant seemed pretty warm, so for all you preppy d-bags, keep that sweater tied around your neck a la your idol, Carlton of the ""Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.""",1
5516,16,3,7/15/2014,"Not quite the dining experience I was hoping for. My family and I regularly do brunch in the city, and we love trying to new places, especially restaurants with great reputations such as Maialino. To be fair, I think your dining experience here will depend on what you like to eat for brunch. My family typically chooses an egg dish, and true to form we ordered the fritatta bianca, contadino, and porchetta. Overall I found our meals lacked a lot of taste and the pork too fatty. However, the almond croissant was absolutely delicious! If you enjoy savory home made pastries, then this place is definitely for you. I must also give credit to their dessert selection. I feel this review of their sweets deserves its own paragraph to emphasize how phenomenal they were. Their gelato/sorbet selections were unique - I chose the strawberry basil, lemon curd, and olive oil. While lemon curd was my favorite due to its rich and creamy texture (literally could have been the custard filling of a pie), the strawberry basil was refreshing and the olive oil was simply very tasty. We also tried the torta della nonna (pine nut and custard tart) and although I was full from my ice cream, I gladly finished it off. Based on my experience, I'm wondering if kitchen staff shouldn't open their own bakery!",1
2664,16,5,7/14/2014,"Yes, five. Â Because that's what this Italian restaurant deserves. Not on the cheap side, this is a fantastic place for a date or family dinner. Â The food here is so spot on, I'd venture to say it's the best Italian I've had in NYC. Â The restaurant is so well designed, with some beautiful street-level windows peering out at the park - I love being in this space. The menu is full of some great, truly authentic dishes. Â The flavor palette here is sophisticated, consistent, and overall pleasant. Â I doubt there's one dish you could go wrong with at this place. Â The authenticity of pasta, the caliber of cook on the meats, the wines they offer, all contribute to an overall fantastic experience. Â  While we've had an awkward waiter once before, it was no game changer. Â The staff overall presents itself well and works efficiently. Â  We'll be back to this place over and over in the years to come.",1
1959,16,5,7/13/2014,"My fiancee has told me many times how good Maialino is, especially for brunch (even though I knew it more as an Italian restaurant), so we stopped by on the recent holiday weekend to take down brunch here. It was pretty empty at 11 AM, so it was easy getting seated, and our food came out very quickly. It has a very nice, casual feel to it - no need to dress it up for brunch at all, and sitting at the bar seems like it'd be an enjoyable way to eat a meal while reading the paper. Our waiter was very nice, if somewhat nervous (maybe he was new). The juices here are delicious and very fresh; the only thing is that it is a bit pricey, even by NYC standards ($8 for a large OJ seems excessive, as did the $8 for the smaller carrot-apple juice that my fiancee had). That's about the only mark down I have against the brunch here, though. The menu items themselves are pretty well-priced across the board; I don't recall seeing anything over $20. We started out with the brioche with homemade jams, which was phenomenally done. I'm a sucker for brioche bread, but these are the thickest slices I'd ever seen - bigger than any I've seen when it's used for French toast. That said, it maintains its distinctive airiness, and the lightly toasted nature of the bread gives it a nice extra crunch. The homemade jams are delicious; my favorite jam has been strawberry for the longest time, and it certainly does not disappoint here. That said, combining it with the rhubarb, which has a bit more texture and is much tarter than the sweetness of the strawberry, is an excellent combo. For my main course, I went with cacio y pepe, but with soft-scrambled eggs instead of the standard pasta version. Although one might question how it looks when you see it at first, it really was delicious. The eggs being softly scrambled means they're still a bit runny, and the pecorino and especially the pepper (which is clearly fresh-ground, judging from the bite on it) add a sharp flavor that really rounds the dish out well. My fiancee had the porcetta sandwich; the roast pork had a good flavor to it, with a definite enhancement with the fried egg on top. It can be a little messy to eat, but it's a simple yet delicious sandwich. To top it off, we split a lamb sausage - very good, particularly because it was moist and succulent. I'd love to come back for dinner sometime, because the brunch is very well-executed here. Being just down the street, I'd definitely come here more frequently than I would to Penelope's up the street, which is priced similarly but always has lines once you get past 9 AM. Maialino does a great job showcasing a brunch menu with Italian inspirations within the standard American brunch palate.",1
5517,16,5,7/12/2014,"Loved brunch at Maialino, especially the poached eggs contadino and the toffee glazed brioche bun. The jam they serve with the seven grain toast is amazing. Service is excellent.",1
5518,16,3,7/12/2014,"It somehow did not meet my expectations. The place is nice but we were squeezed in a small booth at the corner where the seats were quite uncomfortable. Â We were served by a young preppie girl who was somehow speaking to us like we didn't understand english. Â We were a party of four --- two Filipinos, one Indian and one American. The cocktails are limited to only their own concocted drinks so if you just like your simple G&Ts with cucumber, you will not get it. For starters, I had the pate which was good. Â My friend had the carbonara which was really good because instead of pancetta, they put small bits of crispy pork belly. Â The pasta was also very fresh and cooked al dente. Â My other friends ordered the green salad which was just ordinary. For my main course, they had a special which was a suckling pig -- and my expectation of a suckling pig is like the Spanish cochinillo. Â So when it arrived as a slice of pork belly and given its size, definitely DID NOT come from a suckling pig, I was disappointed. Â Also, the top layer of skin was not crispy! Â It was flavorful but it did not have the tenderness of a suckling pig. My other friends ordered pasta and they were luckier -- since the pasta was fresh and well cooked. For desssert, we had the panna cotta and bread pudding which were both good but not fantastic. So if you are looking for great pasta, this is your place. Â But if you are looking for good suckling pig, you might be disappointed. Â Which is odd since ""Maialino"" translates to ""suckling pig"".",1
5519,16,5,7/5/2014,"Their pastas are lovely! Actually, everything was quite authentic and delicious. This is one of my favorite Italian places in the city. Most of the time I came here for lunch.",1

5521,16,4,6/29/2014,Fresh authentic Italian pastas! I'd recommend the spicy Cavatelli. Supremely tasty. Classy atmosphere and professional waitresses.,1
4271,16,5,6/26/2014,"If you keep on coming here like I do, then you'll sound like a broken/scratched record. Whether you sit in the main dining room, bar, front/side tables, or communal table, you'll have an excellent time, especially if you trust the sommelier. Ordered the pig skins and pig tails as appetizers, cavatelli with morel mushrooms to share, and cod and whole roasted rabbit for entrees. Everything was delicious. The pig skins were not just uber crispy, but also quite fresh and porky in scent and taste. Pig tails were nicely fried (not greasy) with good meat. The cavatelli was phe-nom-en-al! Oh so nice and chewy pasta with earthy yummy morel mushrooms. What a dish! The tasty cod was super flaky, fresh and light. The perfectly seasoned rabbit was delicious, tender, and flavorful. For drinks, we started with glasses of champagne (for our appetizers). After that, I asked the som, ""What bottle will be memorable with our non-app dishes?"" and then ordered the bottle below at his suggestion. Ar.Pe.Pe., Sassella Riserva, Vigna Regina, Valtellina Superiore, Nebbiolo 2001 That bottle did NOT disappoint! Also, the som had so many cool stories about wine and champagne that you knew he was very passionate and knowledgeable. Very memorable evening!",1
5522,16,5,6/25/2014,"This is my favorite restaurant in NYC. Â For someone who's as fickle in taste as me to make such a committed statement isn't easy, especially in a city where new restaurants seem to pop up everyday. Why do I love this place? Â Service from both occasions (visits were 2 years apart) were warm and on-point. Â Its ambiance is informal and welcoming, but not hipster trendy. Â There is a large selection of fantastic wine by the glass for those with SO who doesn't drink. Â And lastly, the food is authentic and well prepared, with simple ingredients and well balanced flavors. My most memorable dishes have to be all of their pasta dishes (my husband and I ordered 2nd round after we finished our courses) and of course, the Maialino. Â If you don't believe me, believe my husband, who's born and raised from Milano. Â He dreams about this place too!",1
5523,16,5,6/17/2014,"My fiancÃ© and I were searching for a NYC wedding venue to accommodate approx 200 guests. The event would be reception-only, as we set our ceremony for the prior evening. We searched for and met with event spaces and restaurants all over the city. Maialino was the only one that truly got our vision to deconstruct a dinner into small bites so that all of our guests could try everything. We worked with them for months on the menu, the layout of the room to maximize a combo of tables & dance space, every single detail. They could not have been more friendly and accommodating throughout! The staff was so enthusiastic to help arrange our reception every time we met with them. And, they were extremely fair with the pricing when most other restaurants we met with were very overpriced. By the time our wedding approached, everything they'd done to that point set our expectations extremely high. And, they exceeded everything we thought was possible! The space was beautiful and the food was better than we could've imagined. Our friends and family are still reaching out to tell us how insanely awesome it was! They didn't take any shortcuts, rolling out amazing wines, outstanding dinner items and custom desserts to go along with some of their specialties. I'd list all the menu items here but I'm pretty sure Yelp has a character limit!! I can't think of another restaurant that could've met our vision and executed more perfectly than Maialino. If there was a way to give more than 5 stars, they certainly earned it. We cannot wait to go back to celebrate many more milestones in our lives!",1
5524,16,3,6/9/2014,"Went for brunch on a Sunday!! Be sure to RSVP. I had the scrambled eggs with black pepper... It was really good but needed something with it... The taste got old after a few bites. Would have been better had I of gotten some fruit or possibly even toast. The cappuccino was tasty!! Staff was friendly and willing to answer all questions.. Atmosphere was fun and cozy, very "" NYC"" like! Desserts looked great but I was too full to try them!! Would return here again, possibly to try the dinner menu! The person I was with got the porchetta sandwich, it is very large... And very good!",1

5526,16,4,6/5/2014,"Our current fave brunch destination, and by current I mean for over the past two years. Hello. It's a Danny Meyer spot. His winning formula of hiring a killer chef, finding a great location, serving great food, providing great service and ""must-have"" staples you can't get anywhere else never fails. The man is my idol. Admittedly, he's also a longtime family friend since the opening of USQ Cafe. From the leather, pig embossed check holders to the blue and white gingham tablecloths and warm woods, the atmosphere is both cozy and fun. The bar is fairly large, and a great spot to meet a friend at the last minute or if you can't score a reservation on notoriously crowded weekend brunch hours. There's also a to-go counter where you can pickup some great coffee and a pastry and head out. Just don't expect to get into Gramercy Park unless you're a resident with a key. I'm looking at you, tourists. The Italian twist on breakfast dishes is a winner. I'm going to give you a couple of important tips here. Get the bacon. No, seriously. Get the crazy f'n delicious, thick BACON! Chef Anderer has created addiction-worthy foods that are basic at lesser restaurants. Tip 2. Get the olive oil cake or muffin. GET IT NOW. Enter food coma and thank me. Enjoy a Bloody Mary? You're in the right spot. A Bloody Mary and some downright tasty Counter Culture coffee will fix you right up after a late night. I highly recommend using OpenTable and getting one of the great tables in the small main dining room, where you can linger over your tasty food and drinks and bask in Danny Meyer heaven. The neighborhood is perfect for a post-brunch stroll to walk off the frightening amount of calories you'll have consumed - each one completely worth it. Another home run, DM.",1
5527,16,5,6/3/2014,Everyone must check out this restaurant and try their suckling pig. Â It was by far the best piece of pork to ever grace my lips. Â The portions are huge and everything on their menu is absolutely divine! Â They also make a kick ass cup of expresso. Â I can't wait to go back.,1
5528,16,4,5/29/2014,"Always a great meal, but the service is a bit hit and miss. We almost always sit at the bar and like Gramercy Tavern it's lovely. We lice it. But some bartenders seem to have brain cell deficiencies. Every time it's a man serving us he seem to get lost, wander off ... but the female bartenders are so nice and attentive. I don't get it. Anyway, the food and space are lovely. We keep coming back and love it.",1
4320,16,4,5/29/2014,"Friend and i got the $35 lunch prix fixe with carpaccio, prosciutto e mozzarella, spaghetti alla carbonara and lamb chops.

We asked if we could switch tables since ours leaned on a column that made conversation difficult and there were plenty available. The hostess was very dry and looked as if she was doing a huge favor to us. Our waiter was also very dry, didn't even say good morning or welcome. After that, it took another 15 minutes just to get someone to take our order. The food came another 20 minutes later. We also heard the table beside us complaining about the attitude of the waiters. Food was ok, but after such a horrible service, we don't feel like going back. Nobody seems to be happy working there.",1
5531,16,3,5/22/2014,"I went here for lunch on Monday. Â I had a one o'clock reservation so being seated wasn't an issue. Â I was given water and a menu promptly. Â I waited about ten minutes before my order was taken. Â I noticed that some people were given a bread basket and others were not. Â I figured bread was not given to patrons who ordered from the prix fixe menu as I was not given a bread basket. Â It took about ten minutes to get my salad, and another ten minutes to get my main course. My server did not attend to me at all after she took my order. Â Another server working a different section took my plate when she saw that I was sitting there waiting, and waiting (I wish I could have given her the tip). Â It took another ten to fifteen minutes to get the check. Â I spent more time waiting than eating. Â  I hope that the president got better service than I did when he dined there.",1

Pieces of tender pork accompanied by fresh pasta and some arugula. The reason for the low rating? The service is crazy slow!! Every time I've been here, the service is slow and the wait staff is never very friendly. The drinks take 20 minutes, the food takes 30 minutes, dessert probably took another 10 minutes. It's really a very slow and agonizing wait for everything. This is really just horribly slow for no reason. We even heard other tables asking if the kitchen was backed up and the waiter just said to them that the pasta is made fresh. Jeez.",1
5532,16,3,5/19/2014,"Came for dinner on a Saturday night. Didn't have reservations so we asked if there was any first-come, first-serve space at the bar. We were told there was a separate list for seating at the bar, so we put our names down on both. Five minutes later 3 people came in and asked if there was anywhere they could sit and order food - they were immediately shown to a high table area across from the bar and told it was first-come, first-serve. They grabbed the last seats. After inquiring, we were told ""oh, well you asked about the bar...that's different."" Whatever. By the time we were finally seated, only the late-night menu was available. Appetizer of charred artichoke hearts was delicious, but both pasta dishes (tonarelli cacio e pepe and orecchiette with lamb sausage and broccoli rabe) were decent, but too salty. Maybe they put the ""B"" team in the kitchen for late night service. I wasn't impressed.",1
5533,16,4,5/19/2014,"If i could give 3.5 stars i would... Â we ordered the octopus salad for an appetizer and it was very good... we got the caccio e peppe pasta and the pasta with the suckling pig for main. We figured we needed to order something with pork given where we were eating... and we prefered the non pork food better. The suckling pig pasta dish tasted like there was vinegar or something with too much acidity in it. I guess i was hoping for something different. Also, they took out breadsticks away before we were done and looked at us funny when we asked for another one. Perhaps we will go back, but so many other restaurants to try before that happens.",1

5256,16,4,5/14/2014,"Tucked in the Gramercy Park Hotel, Maialino is a fitting gem of Gramercy. It's encapsulates the feel of the neighborhood--class, comfort, and history. Get on that flatbread!!! CAROTE--REFRESHING NON-ALCOHOLIC drink choice for brunch. It had an extra kick from the GINGER but I loved it. SUPPLI AL TELEFONO--GOURMET MOZZARELLA-TYPE STICKS? This appetizer brought out my inner fat girl who's always craving a combination of crispy, saucy, cheesy, and a bit of starchy goodness. I couldn't get enough!! PORCHETTA--HUGE FOOTLONG ROAST PORK SANDWICH. I SHARED this with a friend so the portion was just right. The EGG was RUNNY and the PORK was COOKED PERFECTLY but LACKED SOME FLAVOR. Overall, it was a good sandwich but it DIDN'T KNOCK MY SOCKS OFF. I also wasn't a fan of the bread. **if you want something CHEESY, order the CACIO E PEPE TORTA DI OLIO D'OLIVA--SO GOOD!! Olive oil, what olive oil? It didn't cross my mind at all because this MOIST ANGEL OF A DESSERT overcame me. Top it off with vanilla bean marscapone and I was in heaven. PANNA COTTA--BEST panna cotta I've had in NYC. The consistency was SO SMOOTH and SILKY and it paired very well with the rhubarb, surprisingly. Decor is very warm and comforting. It's not screaming bougie but it does feel more upscale than your typical trattoria. Turn the corner from the hostess stand and you'll be blown away by the amount of space and seating. It's bustling, vibrant, and when the sunshine comes in, it's such a pretty and simple space. **Something that really attracted me to their MENU is VARIETY.

I knew I was not qualified to work at this caliber but just the odd chance at the opportunity to see first hand the excellence that is Maialino behind the scenes, made me try. The Chef Â de Cuisine, Jason Pfeifer, was kind enough to invite me. I have spent time in many kitchens since, at restaurants of all calibers. NONE have ever even come close to the finely tuned machine, amazing art studio, they call a kitchen here. I can not express the level of perfection and detail invested into each and every single plate that leaves that line to eventually make it to the lucky diner who has no idea how good life is about to get. I got to work alongside co-owner and Executive Chef, Nick Anderer. With him, chef de cuisine, Jason Pfeifer, truly gave me an unforgettable experience. It was truly impressive to watch how these magicians so deceivingly effortlessly turned each dish into a masterpiece. When you have perfected an art, it truly seems like its just nature and gifted talent at play. Â We all know these Chefs have paid their dues and their hard work is ""the business"". So humble and completely different manner in orchestrating the line cooks with out all the Nazi-like- in -your -face -drill sergeant -cussing-throwing- pans- a- la -food network -celebrity chefs. I have eaten here plenty since and I do so with such a deep quiet satisfaction and peace of mind knowing that I know better than most, how immaculate the food being served to me is prepared, stored, cooked handled and served. It is delicious food that is made with as much respect for the diner as the art. I wish more establishments respected the industry this way. Please love yourself enough to experience Maialino.",1
5537,16,5,4/30/2014,"Love this place! At one point, we knew the GM of Maialino's who gave us a proper introduction to this Danny Meyer spot. On location alone you can't go wrong, right off the park and in the Gramercy Park Hotel (without the pretension that you'll find across the lobby at Rose Bar). Whether you're looking for a great spot for an after-work cocktail, or you want an insanely good meal, this is the place. While I typically don't venture in to uncharted territory with my cocktail selections, they have such an inventive list of offerings that I sampled a few on my first trip there (probably a few too many!) Highly recommend the peach smash! We had the bruschetta and a few formaggi selections- all great. As a vegetarian, there aren't many pasta/entree options that don't have meat or fish included, but they happily make accommodations that won't be light on flavor (as can often be the case when making substitutions). I had the tonnarelli which was fantastic, and my husband and friends sampled some of the other entrees, which similarly received high marks. Just about as good as it gets all around!",1

I didn't even think we needed marmalade, but it was lovely too. I will definitely be back to try their dinner menu.",1

5540,16,4,4/10/2014,"The only thing better than going to a Danny Meyer restaurant is seeing Danny Meyer at said restaurant. And only being a table away from him. And since I was way too shy to actually go up to him at the restaurant, I tweeted him... AND HE TWEETED BACK! My inner fangirl was totally squealing. ANYWAY. I went here with a friend/old employer for breakfast pre-work the other day and the food was fantastic. Unlimited coffee + delicious food = a fantastic morning. Even with the mist/rain outside. Since R is a regular, we ended up getting her usual table. (The only reason I subtracted one star was because the seat was broken and they hadn't fixed it. It wasn't the biggest deal while I was sitting, but I totally felt a bit of pain when I got up.) I ended up getting the cacio e pepe scrambled eggs and she got a croissant. Our waiter was amazing but the various servers we had seemed a bit lost. First, R got an untoasted croissant even though she ordered a toasted one with butter. Then, when the toasted croissant came back, there was no butter. I was assured that this wasn't a regular occurrence, but it was weird. The cacio e pepe scrambled eggs were DELICIOUS. Like actually - I could eat bowls of them forever and die happily. It was so hard to narrow down my choice because everything looked so good. It was a bit heavy for my first meal though - I could barely finish it. (I think I made it through 3/4.) Next time, I'm totally trying something else and probably going with a smaller dish, like R. Maialino is also an absolutely gorgeous restaurant. You can sit either in the front of the restaurant (near the entrance of the Gramercy Hotel) or in the back. The front is nice for people watching, but the back is way better for catching up with friends, interviews (like Danny Meyer was doing!) or business breakfasts/meals/meetings. I'm happily making this my new ""grown-up"" breakfast eatery, for when I feel fancy or need to go somewhere the bartenders don't know me as that girl who downed 10 mimosas in an hour that one time.* Or just somewhere I can go now and still go 10-20 years down the road and not get weird looks for eating there. *In my defense, it was actually 5 full mimosas - they just kept topping my glass.",1

Both were way over-salted, which is easy to get wrong if you're using super-aged cheese on the pasta, but is also a rookie mistake in a restaurant. The trippa would have been pretty good hadn't it suffered from the same problem. We tried the flagship roasted suckling pig for main and that was pretty good though, making up for the somewhat disappointing kick-off. Overall I'd go back again to try more entrees, but definitely avoid the pasta.",1
5260,16,5,4/3/2014,"I had a great meal here a few years ago and was drawn back last week by the lure of the new off-menu Roman Ramen. We got a bunch of other things too, which reminded me just how good all of the food here is: - Polpette di Lupo ($8 for 5) I was intrigued by these ""vegetarian"" meatballs. There can be no substitute for meat, but these were really delicious. Made from a mixture of bread crumbs, cheese and ground up veggies, they were slightly crumblier and softer than real meatballs, but had a ton of flavor. - Panino di Porchetta ($12) I had the famous Porchetta sandwich on my previous visit, which I believe is only available at brunch, and is incredible, with the salty pork and runny fried egg on top. This one, which is only available at the bar, may have been even better. Also loaded with that awesome porchetta, this one has broccoli rabe and provolone, so it's like a fancier version of the classic Italian pork sandwich. The pork wasn't too fatty, and the bread had some good crispiness to it. I think there were some pork rinds on top too, which added some more fatty, tasty crunch to it. This sandwich is so good it's worth a visit to the bar to try. - Spaghetti Alla Carbonara ($18) I never thought I'd say this, given my love of al dente pasta and the acclaim they get here for all of the pasta dishes, but this was a little too al dente. The spaghetti was chewier than any I've ever had and almost felt like it was not completely cooked. It was still pretty tasty though, with a good, rich carbonara sauce and plenty of guanciale. - Roman Ramen ($10) This is what we really came here for. I heard they were serving this for just a week, as an off-menu item only available at the bar during dinner time. It might sound gimmicky and weird for a nice Italian restaurant to serve ramen, but one taste of this will blow away any skepticism. It was a pork and chicken based broth, with housemade farro noodles, a soft-boiled egg, and most genius of all, some more of that awesome porchetta in place of the usual chashu. As heavy as this sounds, the broth was much lighter than a typical pork-based broth, but it was still incredibly flavorful. The porchetta went so well with it too. The noodles were very different too, and the bowl as a whole kind of reminded me of the bowls at Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop, which is a very good thing. Also, at just $10, this is a major steal. Not knowing the price since it was off-menu, I would not have been surprised if it were much more. I'm not sure if they're still offering this, but it's definitely worth a trip to the bar to check. - Torta di Cioccolato ($9) After all that richness and pork, we got some of the heaviest desserts possible. I love a good flourless chocolate cake, which is always incredibly rich and overwhelmingly chocolatey. This one did not disappoint, and was one of the best renditions I've had, along with the excellent buttermilk gelato to accompany it and offset the extreme richness. This is a great choice, but still not as good as the other dessert we had. - Budino di Cioccolato ($9) Some people might balk at ordering two chocolate desserts, but I couldn't resist this one either: chocolate croissant bread pudding with hazelnut gelato. This was really incredible, and probably what helped elevate this from a 4-star to a 5-star meal for me. The little round pudding doesn't look like much, but once you cut into it, see that hot melted chocolate oozing out of it, and take a bite along with the refreshing hazelnut gelato, it will blow your mind. Forget the relatively bland olive oil cake, this is the dessert you must get. Service at the bar was ok, but it became tough to get any attention once the night wore on and more and more desperately lonely middle-aged women flirted relentlessly with the young bartender. It's worth experiencing Maialino both at the bar for some of the amazing food you can only get there, as well as at a table with proper service. Either way, you will have a delicious meal and a memorable experience.",1
5544,16,5,4/2/2014,"This is my second visit to Maialino. Â Both times have been excellent. Â From the food to the service, it is top notch. Â The service is very knowledgeable and engaging. Â Excellent wine list with good bottles even in the $40 range (which was surprising). Â My lobster spaghetti special was full of juicy, excellently prepared lobster. Â They do not skimp! Â My husband enjoyed a cavatelli with broccoli and sausage which was also excellent. Â We finished with a panna cotta that was accompanied by citrus slices and was delightful. Â Wonderful meal!",1
5545,16,4,3/31/2014,Suckling pig face = WOAH! Great food and service on a weekend night. Highly reocmmended.,1
5546,16,5,3/31/2014,Anything you order here is good. Â  They have the most memorable customer experience. Â  Best to stop here for lunch because the prices are high for dinner.,1
5547,16,5,3/31/2014,"Omg!!! The manager introduced me to the chef! Â So good looking!!! I wanted to compliment him on the most delicious dishes!! Best dinner ever!!!! Spaghettini Vongole, unbelievable! And a budino!!!! Wow! Will definitely dine again !!!!",1
5548,16,4,3/28/2014,"Ok, I love Italian food, I love breakfast, and I love Blue Smoke (this owner's other restaurant) but this combination did not do it for me. That is the only reason for a one star deduction. The service was good. The restaurant had a great layout and feel to it. The food tasted great...... But for breakfast I was not a fan of the heavy pork emphasis in a morning meal. If this sounds good to you, then this would be a five star meal.",1
5549,16,3,3/26/2014,"The food was good, the service was polite, and the venue was well lit and classy. Pre-Fixe lunch for $35 isn't a bargain given the portion sizes, but it's much cheaper than ordering a la carte. Bread: The bread, foccacia, wasn't bad, but I like my bread warm... which this was not. The olive oil was also flavorless. I didn't bother asking for butter since the bread was cold anyway. Appetizers: I had the Polpo (fried squid with potatoes and scallions), which was good and a nice appetizer portion. My companion had the Agrume (Citrus Salad, Hazelnuts & Pecorino), which she said was good, but overly expensive given that it's just cut up citrus fruits. Entrees: I had the Fettuccine alla Bolognese (lamb ragu & something) - I enjoyed this meal. It looks really small when it comes out, but is heavy enough that I was full by the end of the meal. A very good balance of acid and salt. The meat didn't taste strongly of lamb (or any other meat), but was juicy and I enjoyed it. The pasta didn't stand out for me (maybe I'm not one of those people who can tell if a dish is ""freshly made pasta"" verses store-bought), but it was good and cooked to the right level. My lunch buddy had the Trota (Olive Oil Poached Trout, Baby Lettuce, Farro & Citrus), which she said was good. Â The server did a great job making recommendations for her on what dishes would be ""light."" She seemed to enjoy her food. Desserts: The pre-fixe comes with home-made biscottis, which were fine, but a bit of a cop-out from a real dessert. The service was good, and empty plates were quickly taken away. The slowness came when it was time to pay the bill, but since we weren't in a rush anyway, not a big deal. They leave a bottle of tap water at the table so you don't run out, and they do also try to fill up your cup for you, so, best of both worlds.",1
5550,16,5,3/26/2014,"So I usually avoid Italian restaurants, since in my experience NYC has so many mediocre, overpriced ones. Â Looking at reviews and photos of Maialino (and the fact that it's on the first floor of the Gramercy Park Hotel), I decided to try it one evening. Â Getting a reservation at a reasonable time for a Saturday evening two weeks in advance is actually near impossible, so that shows just how popular this place is! When we got there, we thought it looked a little more casual than we originally expected, but that was just the bar area. The dining room reminds you of a very high-end farmhouse, with a very comforting, welcoming feel. The service was great! The young lady who took care of our table was just friendly enough to provide great suggestions and get us laughing, but not so friendly that she was imposing. Â  The food was PHENOMENAL. Â Highly recommend any of the suckling pig dishes. Â We tried the suckling pig cheek app, the grilled squid app, the rabbit pasta, and the suckling pig special. Â Everything was cooked just perfectly, moist and flavorful, and most importantly not drenched in oil or salt. Pasta (and I mean the actual pasta not just the dish) is made fresh at the restaurant and it really shows through. For dessert, we had the chocolate croissant bread pudding. Â I love both individually, but together they were unbelievably amazing. Â It's a nice light dessert for chocolate lovers to finish out a wonderful meal. For two people, with a bottle of wine, and including tip, it only came out to ~$170, which is reasonable for what we ordered and considering that it was a nice restaurant. Oh, and when we had some of the suckling pig left over, they gave us two ciabatta rolls to make sandwiches with the next day, free!",1
4469,16,4,3/24/2014,"I've been here twice, once for dinner and once for a private party in the backroom and both times the food was EXCELLENT. Maialino reminds me of wine country with their decor and old country style interior. On the exterior, the restaurant looks very classy, but once you step in you realize this is not that type of restaurant. I wouldn't call it trendy, but it has a casual feel to it without being TOO casual. When you get in, you notice alot of wood furnishing from the bar table, seats, wine cellar to the tables, decorative accessories and flooring. I especially love the plaid dining table clothes. As for food, during the time I was here for dinner I ordered the Funghi mushrooms, white wine & anchovy; Coda Alla Vaccinara oxtails, carrot & celery; and Pollo Alla Diavola peppered half chicken & pickled chili. None of these dishes will overwhelm your appetite as they are not huge, but each had very distinct flavors. The Funghi had a very fresh taste to it as the white wine really gave it a nice alcohol kick. The oxtails were marinated in tomato sauce with the stew of the carrot & celery and I really liked the tanginess of the flavor on the stew. The half chicken was very simple, but extremely juicy and moist. I could tell it was intensely seasoned because it was full of flavor from the first bite! Maialino is a simple restaurant that has a very cozy feel to it. It's located in the quiet area of Gramercy Park and easy to get to. There's usually parking around the area so it's never a problem to drive to either. Nothing on the menu will be shockingly out of the ordinary, but the food is real solid and extremely flavorful here. Also, it's great that anyone can have a casual one on one dinner here or if they want they can have a private celebration as there is a backroom for a large party.",1
5551,16,3,3/20/2014,"Zagat 26 stars? Lolz, please. Â Danny Meyer must be paying off the Zagat folks. Â This is on the main floor of the trendy Gramercy Park Hotel. Â Service was slow and the food was just average for a place with this much hype. Â Fat better Italian food options nearby. Â  Not lmpressed!!!",1
5552,16,4,3/19/2014,"My husband picked this place, and it certainly was beautiful inside and the service fab. Was a bit difficult for me since I don't eat PORK, note to husband maybe look at the menu before booking. But they did have some choices that don't include PORK. I know PORK is the new white meat, but I just don't do it. But I did have a really lovely pasta with lobster that was on their ""Prima"" part of the menu. And I loved the minestrone soup, very earthy and full of vegetables with a lovely tomato base (vegetarian) perfect on a cold cold night! Service very nice and lovely choices in our bread basket so all in all we had a very nice dinner. My only wish was there were just maybe a chicken dish on the menu without PORK in it there were a couple of fish dishes in all fairness. But other than that great meal.",1
5553,16,5,3/18/2014,"What can I say? Amazing dinner - certainly the best I've had in NYC (so far). Atmosphere was a good balance of casual and formal; fancy but not overwhelming. Service was fine. The food, though, was really spectacular. Just amazing. Prosciutto and mozzarella - such a simple dish - so unbelievably delicious. My wife ordered a pasta dish (bucatini) which was nice. I decided to splurge a bit for the suckling pig - a smaller, $38 version - which was slow roasted then broiled to create the most amazing, crispy skin, on top of just breathtakingly delicious, fatty pork that literally melted in your mouth. It melted. In your mouth. And the skin was just maximally concentrated, salty, fatty goodness. This was one of those life-changing, food epiphanies that redefines everything you've ever eaten. Unbelievable. OMG. I cannot stop thinking about this dish. Could not be better. My wife generally doesn't care for pork, and she loved it. Olive oil cake with vanilla bean marscapone was equally delicious for dessert - simple, moist, well-balanced, with a hint of lemon that blended really well with all the other flavors. Really nice way to end the meal. And a rather large slice for just $8?? Seriously?? Absolutely worth it. All in all, a perfect dinner. Surely there are more exciting (and much, much more expensive) places to eat in the city - but the fact that my wife and I made it out the door with two drinks, an appetizer, two mains, and dessert for ~ $100 - and each dish was perfect in it's own way - says a lot about the greatness and accessibility of this place. Will be coming back, for sure.",1
4351,16,4,3/13/2014,"In actuality, Maialino needs no additional reviews. Danny Meyer's long-standing restaurant pays homage to the best in Italian cuisine, and has clearly done so with much success. I decided to come here with a friend for brunch, so on a chilly Saturday afternoon, the two of us arrived a little before noon to an already lively dining room. Despite the fact that we'd made reservations in advance, it took a good 15 or so minutes until we were seated as they were ""still preparing our table"". Regardless, we were promptly led through the restaurant and seated in the center, right in the midst of all the hustle and bustle. Even at first glance, it's hard not to love the place. In an area where the dining options aren't plentiful, Maialino offers the perfect solution for a meal in almost any situation. It's nice enough for a special occasion, but also pared down enough for a simple get together with friends or family. The dining area is large and well windowed, with all variety of tables and chairs spread across the room. It does, however, also tend to get noisy easily, especially during peak hours when all said tables are filled with guests. The brunch menu at Maialino was a bit more limited than I had expected, spanning only a page long. There's a good variety available , including the typical savory and sweet dishes, as well as a handful of pastries, sandwiches and salads, and pasta plates. My eyes immediately went to the egg dishes while my friend made the decision to go with one of the pastas; thankfully, she was happy to share. I opted for the Contadino, a dish comprised of two perfectly poached eggs atop a medley of roasted root vegetables and a squash puree. The vegetables were finely cubed and well roasted, consisting of potatoes, sweet potatoes, and butternut squash. The puree was a fairly light addition, adding a creamy and slightly sweet component to the dish. As for the eggs, they were lightly dusted with black pepper and when cut open, the richness of the egg yolk blended perfectly with the vegetables. My only complaint about the dish is that it was rather small in portion, and I found myself wishing for an additional carbohydrate to balance out the dish. My friend's Tonnarelli a Cacio e Pepe was generously portioned for a main. It's one of the most basic pasta dishes, as the name translates into ""Cheese and Pepper"". I loved the chew and how toothsome each strand of tonnarelli was as well as the liberal use of black pepper. It's liberating in its simplicity, but an entire dish would have been too much for me. It may be a personal preference, but I find pecorino to be a more aggressive cheese, and one that occasionally leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste. It's certainly a dish fit for lovers of pungent cheeses, but it's not for everyone. Maialino has its merits - a bustling ambiance, a solid repertoire of Italian dishes, and the backing of one of the world's best restaurateurs. I'd certainly love the opportunity to return for dinner and try a more diverse sampling of plates; if anything, I'm sure it would even better.",1
5554,16,5,3/1/2014,BY FAR My favorite brunch is the city. The ricotta pancakes are cravable. Staff is on another level. Â  Dinner here is wonderful too- be prepared to leave satisfied.,1
5555,16,3,2/28/2014,"The ambiance service was great but I was so NOT impressed with the food. I ordered pasta, as I had been told that was their speciality, and I was super underwhelmed by it. If you want some amazing specialty pasta...Cantina Corsino is great. So sad this place just didn't hit the mark.",1
5556,16,4,2/26/2014,"The food was excellent! The menu can be a little confusing if you have no understanding of Italian but the servers are really good at answering any questions and making suggestions. Â The suckling pig was fantastic and the pasta with delica squash and a sage brown butter sauce was too. Â My only complaint and why I didn't give it 5 stars is that it was too hot in there, they really needed to turn on the AC even if it is November.",1
5557,16,5,2/25/2014,"Went here for brunch on a Saturday. Â Service was so kind and genial. The brioche was out of this world, and porchetta for brunch? Â Yes, please!",1

5558,16,5,2/18/2014,"Had a really lovely meal here the other night.. I was entertaining some guests from China who were spending their first night in NY.. These people have been incredibly gracious to me in the past and was looking for a special place to take them.. This place, without a doubt, fits any special occasion criteria. Â  Â The room is beautiful, it's located directly across from Gramercy Park and the large windows allow you to have a great view.. Service is excellent, the wine list is really comprehensive, there are several large circular tables that allow seating for 6 to 10 people.. Â  I really love a circular table, especially when it is an celebratory occasion. Â  Their wine list is online so, this gave me some time to research the list.. My chinese customers are huge on wine and every bottle I have ever drank with them in China has tasted like cooked prune juice.. I was excited to get them a nice bottle.. Â  We choose a couple of bottles of this 2001 Nerello Blend that was 68 dollars.. Considering i can buy it at a liquor store for 40 bucks, it is not that huge of a mark up. And the wine was incredibly drinkable.. Â A perfect bottle. Â  We ordered family style and the waitstaff handled it perfectly.. we started with some cheese and salamis, we moved on to tripe, octopus, and couple of salads.. Everything was perfect.. Then we had pasta.. A stuffed pasta with chicken livers and balsamic, a carbonara that was awesome and an oxtail ragu that was so good and one other pasta escapes me.. All were great.. Bonus points for watching my customer struggle to get spaghetti on her fork.. I have watched this lady dissect fish with the precision of a surgeon using chopsticks. Â  We then ordered the Maialino roasted pig.. It was 95 dollars and easily fed 5 people with sides.. It came on a bed of roasted potatoes.. We ordered escarole and some o there sides.. Â  For dessert, we ordered an assortment of things that were all wonderful.. The tiramisu, the olive oil cake with marscapone topping were just two of the 4 that came out.. Customers were super happy. Â  The food, the service, the space, Â all perfect.. Â  Bravo.",1
5559,16,3,2/16/2014,The lunch/dinner menu is more creative then the brunch menu. Not a brunch location but is always packed due to the hotel. Will only come back for dinner.,1
5560,16,3,2/10/2014,"This is a review for you offal lovers out there. Â I went with my wife for the Quinto Quarto menu. Â As a fan of the ""fifth quarter,"" I was not overly impressed: Cuore di Pollo -- two ""skewers"" of rosemary each with two slices of chicken heart. Â Tasty, if a bit salty (and I have a very salty palate). Â Kind of a winner at only $3 a pop. Â  Cuore di Maialino -- sliced pig heart salad in a bath of vinegar and peppers. Â Complete miss. Â Tasted of nothing but vinegar. Â Heart was very tender, but it could have been any kind of meat. Â Pass. Cotiche Fritte -- pork cracklings and ""spicy"" vinegar. Â I detected no spice to speak of in the vinegar. Â Indeed, it seemed to be the same vinegar that comes with the pig heart salad. Â The cracklings are light and airy, but have a distinct overly fried taste. Â Not much better than pork rinds from a bag at your corner bodega. Â Only $3, but pass. Sweetbreads with prosciutto and mushrooms -- I don't see this on any of the menus online, but this was very tasty, and I don't recall it being very expensive. Â The sweetbreads were very tender and creamy. Â Three to an order. Testarella al Maialino -- The menu describes this as ""Crispy Suckling Pig Face & Market Greens."" Â Frankly, I expected this to be something along the lines of a fried head cheese or terrine. Â No. Â It's half of a pig's head, fried and served on a plate of ""field greens."" Â The head was fried very well. Â The ear, snout and muscle behind the jaw were crunchy and delicious. Â The cheek was about as good as it could be under a thick sheath of fat. Â The lemons on the plate lightened the dish considerably. Â Again, this dish was very, very salty. Â Also, I couldn't tell you what the ""field greens"" (i.e., baby spinach, I think) added to the dish other than some color. Â They pretty much wilted almost instantly under the heat of the pig head, and I don't believe they were seasoned at all. Â I don't think I would order this dish again, but at only $14, it's kind a steal. Â  My wife had a pasta dish (orecchiette with sausage I think). Â It was fine. Service was great. Â We showed up without a reservation at 7 and were promptly seated in the bar area (albeit at a high-top in an alcove by the coat check and the door to the hotel, but I can't blame them for that given when we showed up). Â Dishes came quickly. Â Only bobble was that our waitress couldn't really see us when we tried to signal her, but the host kept an eye on us and grabbed her when we needed her.",1
5561,16,3,2/8/2014,"Was good to experience it but wouldn't go again. I feel like I make better pasta. The lamb chops and cod were definitely good. The table though was way to small and the different servers had to keep moving things around the whole night. The service was not that great. I didn't see our main waitress smile even once. She forgot about my drink on two occasions and then forgot to bring the wine out for my friends when the pasta arrived, as they had requested. We had a few desserts. The maple ice cream was probably the best out of all of them.",1
5562,16,5,2/8/2014,I came once for dinner a while ago and thought it was good but after coming again for lunch I'm upping my rating to 5 stars. I thought the food was really great and the setting in the Gramercy Hotel is attractive too.,1
5563,16,3,2/6/2014,We came in out of the snow for a delicious meal and some red wine. It took 20 minutes for someone to take our drink order and then we had finished our entree before the drinks made it to our table. The food was worth the wait but I already had a bad taste in my mouth about the below average service.,1
5564,16,3,2/3/2014,"Pleasant but unexceptional meal with uneven service. Â We were promptly seated and then left alone for nearly 20 minutes until someone not our waiter asked if we needed help selecting a wine. Â 10 minutes later the waiter arrives to go through the menu and take our orders. Â The first course was a little slow getting to the table but uneventful. Â 30 minutes after the first course was cleared someone (not our waiter) comes to our table to tell us that the main course would be out in about 10 minutes and offered us a few appetizers while we waited. Â While the offer was gracious and appreciated, more attentive service would have been appreciated more.",1
5565,16,5,1/30/2014,"Had a wonderful meal here last night. Our table let our server curate a menu for us and select wine pairings and we couldn't have been more pleased! The pig face was incredible, both in flavor and presentation. In addition the wines were superb.",1
2443,16,5,1/28/2014,"I've only been to Maialino for brunch, but it is definitely one of the top brunch spots in the city. Â The location can't be beat, as is sits inside the beautiful Gramercy Park Hotel in a secluded yet very convenient area of Manhattan. Â The restaurant itself is beautiful - it's very light and airy, and is has a bustling feel without being crowded. Â The menu has a lot to choose from, and everything I've tried is incredible. Â All of the breakfast pastries are fresh and delicious, and you can tell they are baked in-house. Â The eggs, sides, and pancakes are equally delicious. Â The menu also has many lunch dishes that I've never tried but look great and are probably closer to the dinner menu, including pastas and sandwiches. Â It is the kind of restaurant you'll want to linger at, and it is perfect for a special occasion. Â Brunch gets busy, but making a reservation is not a problem.",1
5566,16,5,1/21/2014,"I had quite possibly the BEST brunch of my life at Maialino! Â If you are in the mood for brunch and have built up quite the appetite, this is the place to go! I went with 3 other friends, and we decided to order a bunch of things and share. Â I am having a hard time figuring out which was my favorite because everything was so good. Â The ricotta pancakes were INSANE, and I don't even like pancakes! Â Also you MUST try the tomato risotto croquettes, as they were probably the best croquettes I've ever had. Â the swordfish with the goat cheese was perfectly cooked, and the salsiccia Â on the side was absolutely to die for. Â Not to mention the pastry basket we split before the meal! Â Everything was delicious. Now, the maple bourbon gelato...well I don't know what to say. Â Nothing I can type in this box will do justice to the orgasmic experience that was putting that gelato in my mouth. Â PLEASE take my word for it and go eat brunch at Maialino, if only for the gelato! On top of all the wonderful food (and drinks!), our service was perfect! Â I think our server's name was Robin, and she was an absolute doll! Â Super cheerful and friendly and also very helpful in assisting us with our food choices. Â Hopefully we get her as a server next time because we DEFINITELY will be coming back to Maialino again!",1
5567,16,3,1/20/2014,"So I came here for brunch with some friends. I got the Frittata Bianca- probably my own fault for getting this- it was as plain as anything could possibly be. Literally just egg whites and some herbs mixed in. I didn't mind it until I got to a section of very salty eggs and then I couldn't keep eating. A few of my friends got the Ricotta Pancakes- which were very good (I was more a fan of the ricotta than the pear compote it comes with)! I'm more of a savory breakfast person but if you're into sweet options I'd recommend the Ricotta pancakes. I didn't eat the Contadino- just tried a little bit of the squash puree and that was pretty good. Service was good, ambiance was nice for a Sunday morning- also I saw Rosie Perez and that kind of made my morning. I'll probably give this place another shot at some point and be a little more bold with my selection.",1
2715,16,1,1/19/2014,"Actually had my birthday dinner here and I have to say even though I wanted it to be good, in hindsight I just don't remember it being good. Only memorable dish was the olive cake for dessert (e.g., had the 'famous' suckling pig dish but wasn't impressed). Â I also been a couple times after that for brunch and service was atrocious. Â I wished I had given a zero dollar tip and told management because that's how bad the service was there. Â  Overrated for the food, service, and price. Â Deserves one star - maybe two for the olive cake.",1
5568,16,4,1/18/2014,"I have to say- this place is our standard bearer for Italian (Lupa as well) - I am sure others out there have bigger better favorites- but for us, the decor, the service and the ambiance paired with the menu is really just a very nice place to go for an easy going stress free dinner. Wife who was a mac and cheese kinda girl (from a box) - became a a Cacio e Pepe fan. Impressive by any standard. As for me- all their pastas have been impeccable its hard to pick a favorite. As for the Seconds- really great simple presentations- half chicken, so boring sounding, but when prepared properly- nothing beats it on a lazy Sunday evening- with some rapini or roasted vegetables. Also had a memorable spring pig here.. a couple years back- and same deal- crisp skin, succulent meat- Overall- one of the truly great un-hyped restaurants in the City.",1
5569,16,4,1/17/2014,"More casual than I thought it would be looking at it from the outside. But still a classy place. Got drinks at the rose bar across the lobby which were $$$$. Least expensive drink was $18. Hostess grabbed us when our table was ready which was convenient. Friendly staff but the service was a bit slow. As for food, pÃ¢tÃ© was good. Came with a bunch of pickled veggies that went well together, although a bit sweet for my liking. Shared the spaghetti carbonara and fettuccine bolognese. Both pastas were cooked really well, but the carbonara was super salty. Bolognese was delicious. The one thing I noticed is that the sauce on both dishes were not very saucy, almost dry (but still tasty). I just assumed that must be Roman style?",1
5570,16,2,1/12/2014,"Today was my third visit to Maialino. I've been there twice before, once for a private dinner in their back room, and once for brunch. Today we went to brunch again because I like this place. My previous two times I've had a fun experience at Maialino but this review is particularly due to the waitress we had today. We had a lady named Charlotte helping us today and god knows what was wrong with her. We sat down, she came over and had this tone, unfriendly looks and this general attitude of ""you've annoyed me"". Which we couldn't fathom since, we had only sat down. We were like ok, maybe she is in a rush, but nope, every time she came back had the same smirky, i don't really want to help you attitude. Our scrambled egg seemed like they could use some greens so we asked if we could get a side of asparagus, she said they didn't have any, but could offer us broccoli-rabe or a salad. That didn't seem like what we were in the mood for so we said, ""no that's ok"" and she rolled her eyes at us! Not sure what brought that on! The rest of the brunch continued with an unfriendly tone from her and by this time we were growing apprehensive of her. I felt bad that I brought my friends here for brunch hoping to have the same good experience I did before. We filled out the Comments card they give us saying that our waitress was very unfriendly but decided not to hand it in, instead Yelp about it.",1
5571,16,5,1/3/2014,"Absolutely delicious! I have been here several times and have brought out of town guests and every time it is consistent, has excellent service and tasty dishes!",1
5572,16,4,1/3/2014,"After a few Christmas cocktails, we headed over to enjoy dinner at Maialino in the Gramercy Hotel. While the restaurant was fully booked for the evening, there was a short wait for the bar and soon we found ourselves enjoying a lovely sparkling wine underneath the Christmas tree at the end of the bar. Service, as always, was outstanding. To start, we enjoyed the Insalata -- fennel, citrus, hazelnut and pecorino. Â I have never been as obsessed with a salad as I was this salad. Please do yourself and order this. It's crisp, refreshing and the pecorino adds a great contrast to the citrus. I enjoyed the orechiette with lamb sausage, cauliflower and pecorino while my mom enjoyed the Â Spaghettini alle Vongole. Â  Â As someone who rarely orders pasta, this was the way to spend those extra calories. Â  Oh -- I almost forgot! We shared the brussels sprouts. I have no idea how they managed to make my most hated vegetable as a child taste like this, damn, they do it well. Already thinking of my next trip to Maialino. Well done, guys!",1
5573,16,5,1/2/2014,"Wow! One of the best meals I've had in a long time! The place is very comfortable, warm and inviting. Our waitress, Juliana was wonderful! Very knowledgable, personable and patient while we took our time deciding what we wanted. Now for the food! We had the ravioli with the white truffles. To die for! Best bite of the night. Their homemade pastas are amazing. We enjoyed the tortarelli (which are like little ravioli with pÃ¢tÃ© inside) the garganelli with rabbit ragu and the pappardelle. The roast suckling pig as an entree was also fantastic. They have a nice coffee bar and dessert menu As well. Can't wait to return.",1
1632,16,4,1/1/2014,"Tasting menu at Maialino? Why yes, please! The tasting menu was not a ""tasting at all."" Each presentation (appetizer, pasta, main, dessert) came with 3 dishes, pretty much full portion each, I kid you not. Most dishes were great, but the stand-outs were: Insalata (fennel, celery, citrus, pecorino, hazelnut), Tortelli (pork and chicken liver raviolis), and Pesce Spada (seared swordfish with leek and salsa verde). The desserts we tried were good, but not particularly memorable. If you are into chocolate, try the Tartufo. Like I said, the dishes were great, but those were the standouts, in my opinion. The atmosphere was romantic but also casual/laid back enough. There were a few families around, and the noise level wasn't that loud.",1
5574,16,3,12/26/2013,"I was a bit disappointed in Maialino. Â My boss took us all to lunch here for the holidays, and I had high expectations. Â  Â  Â My first course was fried artichokes with lemon, which were quite good - however, it was a very simple preparation that even I could have made at home. Â  Â For the main course, I ordered the pork bolognese pasta entree which looked fantastic, but at the last minute, my coworker asked to switch - she had ordered the spaghetti carbonara. Â I was expecting a traditional spaghetti carbonara, and thought that mushrooms were gracing the pasta before I switched. Â Instead, it turned out that it was pork jowl. Â UGH. Â  The meat was translucent and disgusting, and I could barely get one piece of it down. Â The pasta, in my opinion, was too al dente - it would have been far better if it had been cooked longer, since it was probably homemade. Â  Â The real star was the dessert - flourless chocolate cake with buttermilk gelato. Â It was incredibly rich, but absolutely fantastic. Â Actually, every dessert option looked incredible. Â  Not sure if I would go here again - to be honest, the pasta entree left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. Â I'm sorely regretting agreeing to switch with my coworker! Â She did finish every last bite of her pasta entree.",1
5575,16,5,12/18/2013,"Loud, crazy, fun, and delicious food. If you`re really lucky Rihanna will be your hostess. Grilled octopus is to die for. Be prepared to wait- its worth it.",1
5576,16,5,12/16/2013,"My third time at Maialino, and what a great time! We were a party of 4 and we decided to try the family style tasting menu. Robin, our server, was very accommodating- taking into consideration our different allergies and food preferences. The menu was absolutely delicious from beginning to end. The fried artichoke hearts and radicchio salad was good but star of the show was definitely the pasta dishes; Malfatti being the top choice! Another exceptional dish was the Coda alla Vaccinara, braised Oxtail was cooked to perfection. Looking forward to our meal time at Maialino.",1
5577,16,5,12/9/2013,"Places like this are the reason that us New Yorkers are spoiled. Â Had dinner here again recently, can't believe I haven't posted a review yet! Â Never had a bad meal here (and I've had a bunch). Â The pasta dishes are amazing - fresh, homemade pasta (hence why we are so spoiled). Â The suckling pig is amazing - can't get anything better. Â Start all of that off with some cured meats and cheese = one happy girl.",1
1610,16,3,12/9/2013,"3.5 Stars I came here based on a recommendation by a friend who says this is one of her favorite restaurants in the city. The location is charming since it is right on Gramery Park. The atmosphere is cozy and rustic. I felt the food all around to be good but great. My boyfriend and I shared the following: Pappardelle alla Bolognese- It came with a vodka type sauce and this dish was our favorite part of the meal. Spaghettini alle Vongole- I wasn't a huge fan of this dish. I've had much better pasta dishes at Scarpetta and L'artusi. Lamb Chops- Only three small lamb chops. We thought this was a ridiculously small entrÃ©e portion. While there were some great flavors, there was just not enough food. Hazelnut Budino- The highlight of this dessert was the hazelnut gelato which had bits of hazelnut inside. Apparently they make their gelato in-house. The actual budino was just okay. The service was pretty slow and felt like we were waiting awhile between courses. All in all, the food was decent but I don't think I would return.",1
5578,16,1,12/7/2013,"I was at a party last night. Well, actually three parties but they're all a blur to me now. At the second party I hooked up with this guy who was pretty cute and we went off together to Shadow to party there. Yeah - late night. By 3am there was no way I was going to spend the night alone. We were dancing and kind of stoned, and he said he was staying at the Gramercy. Judging from the amount of money he was throwing away all night, I wouldn't have been surprised had I even known what the Gramercy hotel was. Anyway, next morning I woke up in a pretty pissy state. The guy said he still needed more sleep and I kind of wanted to ditch him anyway. So i got my stuff together and went down to this place mailino which is sort of in the hotel. The guy said something about chocolate croissants being the best. And that's kind of what I needed - sugar and caffein. The hostess looked at me like I was some street urchin. I guess she didn't like that my hair was a mess. But technically there was nothing she could about it. Yeah I probably smelled like a combination of man musk and first hand smoke, but she couldn't have turned me away if she wanted to. I was wearing $200 denim, $300 shoes. I just looked like I had more fun than she did that night. The croissants are good, not great. Coffee was what you get in any decent restaurant. I was there for all of 30 min eating and texting. But the whole time I was there the staff kept looking at me. No one asked if I wanted anything else. I really felt like a second class citizen. This is the kind of place where you pay for the atmosphere. It's beautiful. But the atmosphere is killed when you're treated like a street person.",1
5579,16,4,12/6/2013,Open and warm atmosphere. Â Present and friendly staff. Pate was as good as any. Â Seafood stew was subtle and delicious. A definate return trip in store.,1
5580,16,5,12/1/2013,"I came to maialino with no expectations but let me tell you, this place. BLEW. Me. away. To start, the service was mostly adequate. Nothing special. Just serviceable. Â Next,the food.... Also straight down the middle. Â Maybe slightly above average. Â My soft scramble eggs were both soft and scrambled. Â It's what I asked for so no complaints here. Â But the big finale came with the presentation of the checks. Â I've been going to restaurants for nearly 3 decades, and I've never quite seen receipts quite like these. Maialino jumped the service rating to astronomical heights by telling me that the signed copy was the merchants and the other copy was mine. Â They freaking gave me the option to choose which receipt was mine! Â Thank you Mailino for understanding the true principles of America.",1
5581,16,4,11/30/2013,"The restaurant is next to Gramercy park, one of the most beautiful parks in nyc, quiet and understated, yet magical and one senses the weight of its presence. The ambience of the restaurant reflects it: earthy, wood panels, dim lights. The food was excellent. Even though it lacks the ingenuity of some of the top-end restaurants, everything was delicious. Â  We had pork crackling as snack to start and it literally crackled in the vinegar dipping. The Fried artichoke was phenomenal (as benioff says in his salesforce speeches). The artichoke was soft inside without loosing its structure, lightly fried to give the outside just the right amount of crispiness. We also had he rabbit garganelli and lamb chop. The pasta was good but nothing extraordinary. The lamb was very tender and full of flavor (liked the vegetable garnishes of carrots, turnips and Jerusalem artichokes). Fantastic choice of Italian wine by the glass, especially for the vintage ones.",1
5582,16,5,11/29/2013,"The fact that it was just so WRONG for our health was what made it so f'n good. Â  The first time we dined here we had the Testarella al Maialino - otherwise known as crispy suckling pig face - from the offal menu. Â It was the most memorable dish and to this day still makes me drool like some sort of Pavlovian dog. We have been back multiple times for lunch and dinner, both business and for pleasure and we usually now stick to the pasta selections - the Tonnarelli a Cacio e Pepe is usually the go-to choice. Â The preparation here is a bit more dry versus what we have seen at other places but it is still elegantly simple and flavorful. It is a pretty popular restaurant so reservations are recommended. Â Service is very efficient and friendly. Â The courses arrive at a nice cadence so you are not just sitting around. Â I really don't get the decor here as it seems more southern country fried U S of A as opposed to Roman, but whatever.",1
5583,16,4,11/29/2013,"family style is the way to go here, and stick with the pastas. Warm room, nice buzzy feel, not as expensive as we expected. Good for a birthday or special occasion for sure. Fun to meet at bar in hotel before or after too.",1
5584,16,4,11/27/2013,"Very nice Italian food in a classy yet cozy atmosphere. Â Their pastas are cooked in just right al-dente, the sauce is rich and delicious! Â Their olive oil is full of flavor, and it makes the table bread extra satisfactory!",1
5585,16,4,11/23/2013,One of the best restaurants in the city . Â  The wait staff is very knowledgable and I always end up with a great bottle of wine from one of their recommendation .. They have some of the best pasta specials most nights and can highly recommend the amatriciana .,1
5586,16,5,11/22/2013,"One of the better meals I have had in this town! Went for a birthday celebration, it's on the higher end of the price spectrum.. Still, the food was well worth it. The house made fresh pasta with pecarino and black pepper was quite decadent. And the baby lamb chops were out of this world tender and delicious especially being paired with the side off sauteed wild mushrooms (shitake, oyster, and portobellos). Â The olive oil poached cod was solid but was not on the same level as the other dishes. IMO that's a pretty good problem to have.",1
2216,16,5,11/21/2013,One of my fave restaurants in the City. I've eaten here a number of times - in the main dining room and also at the bar for happy hour - food is consistently good and excellent service. The hosts/hostesses are always cheery and in good spirits. They don't charge you for ice tea refills - a rarity in NYC restaurants. Their bread basket is delish. Great happy hour specials at the bar during week nights and the crowd is anything but pretentious. A classy and quality italian restaurant - one I take most family and friends visiting from out of town.,1
5587,16,2,11/17/2013,"the restaurant is beautiful and the service is wonderful, but the brunch was meh. the best dishes at the table were the croquettes and the lemon ricotta pancakes, maybe i just ordered poorly, but my poached egg wasn't anything special. i would go back, but Â not in a hurry.",1
5588,16,4,11/13/2013,"Let's start with the good stuff...THE FOOD! It's absolutely fabulous. Started with a kale salad. It may sound a bit dull, but it was very light and tasty. I had the fettuccine Alla bolognese which was simply amazing. The flavor was like nothing I have has before and the aroma was magnificent! Also tried the Malfatti which too was fabulous. For dessert we had the torta di olio doliva( olive oil cake) and the Tartufo. Both were excellent! I did prefer the cake. I had light lemon flavor to it and the olive oil really worked great. Â The atmosphere was very nice and the noise level was good. You probably want to make a reservation. They do have open seating in the bar. Â Would have given them a 5 star, but the service was just ok and they forgot to bring the fried artichoke appetizer we ordered. That was very disappointing as I was really looking forward to trying that item. Â In summary, this place is a must try!",1
5589,16,4,11/11/2013,"Friend hosted her baby shower here on Saturday afternoon. Awesome private space in the back and the food was really delicious. I had the fried artichoke heart for appetizer with lemon. It was delicious! perfectly fried with crunchy outside (not burnt but looked it) and tender moist leaves. You get a wedge of lemon and can squeeze as much juice (or as little) as you want on it. IMHO it made the dish complete. Â  Then had the pork belly pasta. Hand made pasta - Pappardelle style... not a big portion, but with the potatoes (perfectly seasoned with crunchy exterior and soft inside) and escarole sides, plenty of food to fill me up. Got the croissant chocolate bread pudding with hazelnut ice cream. I understand that this may reduce the moistness that people look for in bread pudding...but I wish I could have tasted the croissant-ness a bit more. Â  Don't know the price of the meal so 4 stars based on food.",1
5590,16,4,11/10/2013,"Was there again in mid September for my wife's birthday. The team is so friendly, they always give us a nice table. I have been there for brunches only. Delicious olive oil muffin, but to be honest all the pastry are delicious, including the toffee glazed brioche bun, and you can share them with your guests. The place is family friendly. The brunch menu always change, to stick to the flavors of the season. I loved the carbonara ($17) but when I returned they were not on the list anymore. The Porchetta sandwich ($16) is delicious, a must tried.",1
5591,16,3,11/9/2013,"Came here for a late brunch/early dinner with my boo and really enjoyed the scene. It has huge windows all along the side with beautiful views of gramercy park. We started with the bloody mary which was nice and spicy! Great bread and oil, nice staff, but my meal was lacking major flavor. The food and drinks are on the pricey side but that is because you are right next to gramercy park and in a beautiful hotel! Their happy hour specials do look affordable and dinner menu looked appetizing. Rose bar next door is fun and swanky too!",1
5592,16,2,11/8/2013,"We had really high hopes for our meal here, based on high ratings on Yelp and Zagat, but ultimately my husband, mother-in-law and I were all disappointed with our dishes. Â We showed up a couple mintes early for our 2:00 reservation (they are so popular that this was the only time we could get when we checked OpenTable the previous day) but weren't seated until between 5 and 10 past. Â Not the best start. Â Fortunately, we quickly got wonderful focaccia bread and very good olive oil. For our entrees, I had the cacio e pepe. Â I enjoyed this dish when I had it in Italy but not so much this version. Â  The pasta was good but there was way too much pepper and it overwhelmed the dish. Â My husband had a special pasta with tuna and lemon. Â  The lemon flavor was way too strong and you could not taste anything else. Â My MIL had a pasta with clams - the general consensus was hers was the best because it did not have a single flavor overwhelming it, but as my husband pointed out when a dish is the best simply because it tastes the most like ""nothing"" it's not really an endorsement for the restaurant. Note that it takes awhile to have a meal here - ours took about an hour. Â Apparently the pastas my husband and MIL ordered took longer to cook because they are ""dry pastas,"" so our waitress brought out a complimentary bowl of olives - none of us like olives but it was thoughtful. Â This place is quite pricey (pastas range from $16 to $20 or so and entrees start in the high $20s) and we all agreed it was not worth it.",1
5593,16,4,11/6/2013,"One of the better spots I've found in the Gramercy area and a guaranteed winner from Danny Meyer. The food and ambiance pass both the parent test as well as the Grandma test, so can't go wrong. Reservations are a little hard to come by, but they do have a waitlist and I've also walked in before to get a table on a weeknight. The ragu was one of my favorites, as is the soft shell crab appetizer! Â More of a parent/date spot and a lively, but talkable atmosphere.",1
5594,16,4,11/2/2013,"Our waiter was super sweet and friendly. Loved the fried artichokes and kale salad. Swordfish was exquisitely cooked. Chicken juicy and tender. The chef sent out some beef cheek carpaccio which was melt in your mouth delicious. Warm budino for dessert is the way to end it. Perfect balance of comfortable, un-stuffy atmosphere (noticed a Williamsburg-esque uniform of plaid shirts, beards, and hipster glasses) and fine dining attention to detail (crumbing our white table cloth and clearing from the right = A+ in my book.) Big thumbs up for great food and incredible service.",1
4654,16,3,10/30/2013,"3.5 Stars I came here for brunch with my cousin visiting from out of town. The place is beautiful and I love the area around Gramercy Park and it just feels so nice here, like it belongs in the neighborhood. That being said, the food was average for me. I mostly remember the carbonara, which was good but really salty. Also ordered a few bloody mary's and enjoyed them. Service was nice, which should be obvious since this is a Danny Meyer's place. Â  One thing I must mention is when I was sitting down, the leather seat has a huge dark spot where the crotch area is. It almost looks like someone peed on the seat or like sweated heavily which seeped into the leather and it kind of grossed me out. I should have asked for another seat but I didn't want to be difficult. Anyhow, I would like to try this place out for dinner.",1

5597,16,4,10/23/2013,"I'll preface my review with the disclaimer that I understand restaurants at peak hours in and around Manhattan can be crowded, noisy, and short staffed. This night was no exception: three of us for dinner, waiting near the bar for a drink while other people wait near the bar (you get the idea), then realizing when bar seats free up that they're 'reserved'. We were generally disregarded by the bar staff in favor of the seated patrons...oy vey! In most cases the bar staff solicits you as a sort of...I don't know...hospitable thing to do, being that they're 'hosts' of a sort and represent the establishment? Y'know, ask 'What'll you have?', even if they're running around crazy busy? We spoke with a gentleman that was still standing long after we finished our meal and he said, 'I've lived next door for years and they still treat me like this.' Ok, onto the food... We ordered multiple apps to share three ways which served our appetites well. I especially liked the chicken liver tortellini and a couple of the veggie apps were very well prepared although the portions were a tad 'dainty'. The bar is open to the first section of the restaurant so noise and traffic is a problem-I'd rather sit further in the restaurant where it looked quiet and cozy. The staff was attentive once we were seated and the drinks were done well, although wine appears to be their specialty and I certainly couldn't begin to narrow down a glass or bottle without their help. So, all-in-all, I have to agree with another yelper in saying that it's hyped up and spendy for the experience but we duked it out for our friend, a repeat patron, who loves the place. Would I go back? Yeah, but on an 'off' night where we could sit at a table at a relaxed pace (for NYC).",1
3612,16,5,10/23/2013,"Pasta is perfect al dente to the point that I'm thinking I've never had al dente this way. Almost as if they take it part hard and it cooks sitting. Prosciutto w mozzarella smokey and delish. The latte art is admirable and commendable. The drink menu is complete with Peroni, AMA, other more upscale names that I don't know but the server we had was informed. They serve Counter Culture coffee from north or South Carolina Â and the morning olive oil muffin is like crack. Love how this place is unassuming and nestled in a great neighborhood. Most server seem to have a pleasant charm. Â There was just once when I didn't get that but it might've been end of shift and they were tired from am rush.",1

5600,16,5,10/15/2013,"Relaxed atmosphere, delicious pasta, great drinks. As I entered the restaurant, I noticed it was louder and more relaxed in the front where the bar was situated. Ideal for grabbing a drink somewhere nice after work with a friend and catching up. Our waitress lead us to middle of the restaurant; bigger, more serious parties seemed to populate the back of the restaurant and the atmosphere felt more intimate there than the front. My date and I both ordered a drink from the menu, which helped us cope with the wait time. Although service was friendly and helpful, it felt slow at times and our bread took a while to come out to us. I ordered the Pappardelle that featured a Lamb Ragu & Grana Padano. Absolutely mind-blowing. Tons of savory flavor and completely swept me off my feet. The pasta here is fabulous and you can certainly taste the difference. Afterwards, we hung out at the lounge across from the restaurant and played some billiards. Quiet, intimate, great way to relax and cap off the night. In terms of price, certainly more on the expensive side. The specials sounded amazing but landed a bit out of my price range. Would love to come back and try more intricate dishes and more drinks in the near future. Definitely need to come back and try the brunch, more drinks, and the snack menu. Although I only had a few cocktails, the wine list featured a healthy selection and the snack menu looked affordable and enticing if drinking late night with friends.",1

Â Our entries included the Malfatti (Braised Suckling Pig & Arugula) and the Raviolo Al Uovo, a single ricotta and spinach-filled ravioli covered in white truffle shavings and housing a single egg yolk that was released into a pool of tart brown butter laced with lemon.

5603,16,3,10/12/2013,"I live around the corner from here so it's a regular place. This review may be a little unfair because yelp doesn't give us a very detailed way to review stuff. (We should at least be able to review based on a fee different criteria - a star system for food, another one for service say... But enough about reviewing Yelp!) I'll definitely say the food here is 5 stars it is fabulous, amazing, not enough goo to say about it. But I've noticed a persistent problem every time I've eaten here with the service. The wait staff is friendly a knowledgeable for the most part...but I'm constantly waiting for another glass of wine! It's a cardinal sin in my book to let someone's wine go empty! (We were drinking different wines so by the glass instead of bottle.) I keep looking around to find my waiter, to order another glass while my food gets cold. Sometimes the problem may be with the bar getting the drink out too. Whatever the case, I choose the wine to go with the food so I want it with the food! What's up with that?",1

While the ricotta pancakes, porchetta sandwich, cacio e pepe pasta, Counter Culture coffee program during brunch are still just as good - I've found the overall experience during brunch to be on a decline. Service has been painfully slow on both of my recent Sunday brunch visits, so much so that I had contemplated whether our server was intentionally ignoring us or just taking extra long smoke breaks. Anyway, that's pretty unacceptable for a Danny Meyer establishment IMHO. Dinner service has been just fine based on recent memories. However, I'm finding it a little difficult at the moment to disassociate the brunch experiences that's left a slightly sour taste in my mouth. You know what they say, you eat at a restaurant for the food but come back for the service.",1

Now the Cons... Service was dismal. Â Waited about 45 mins for our egg dishes after the Pancakes were served. Â Once we finally got our food they dropped it and ran - no one asked how it was (thankfully it was delish, but there is always someone that needs hot sauce, ketchup, etc) ... Bottom line, when you come here the bar is raised and the service should uphold the reputation (and prices). Most shocking, when we let the manager know about the wait, he never followed up.

Started with the caprese, which was delicious but when is it ever bad? Then moved on to the maialino for 2 aka decadent pieces of the suckling pig portioned for 2 and a side of the sauteed spinach. We also got a bottle of red but the name escapes me, all in all it was a very tasty meal!",1

Â However when my client asked for balsamic vinegar to go with the bread and olive oil, that took a while to come. Not something I expect from a $$$$ restaurant. Â While everyone order pasta, I order the roast pork. Â When the dishes arrived, the pasta dish was the size of appetizers, very very small. Â My friend order the special with the truffles. Â It was ok and she was left hungry. Â Her 11 yr old son order two dishes and fished it all. Â My pork was delicious but I was the only one with a decent size dish. Â My husband had the squash ravioli, it was 4 pieces or ravioli! Never have a been to an Italian restaurant and left feeling still a bit hungry. Â  The ambiance was nice an relax and I believe connected to a hotel so has the perfect classy side of Gramercy Park. Â The staff was polite but not super attentive and not keep to noticing the little things.

5612,16,4,9/21/2013,A friend and I came here after I saw the fried artichoke app featured in time out. We were a bit disappointed in the app as they lacked flavor.

5613,16,4,9/10/2013,"My first meal after landing in JFK was at Maialino, at my friend's recommendations and one of her favorites. Â It's a lovely restaurant, adjacent to the lush and plush Gramercy Park with sophisticated decor. Â I mostly love that when you look out the windows of Maialino, you see the greenery of the park, which is so rare in NY. The complimentary bread basket contained two types of bread, including a foccacia. Â There was olive oil for dipping but I didn't spend too much time on the bread. We decided to share an entree sized pasta so we ordered a few starters to share as well. Â The first was the simply named Melanzane e Ricotta. Â  The eggplant cubes were wonderfully done - tender and luscious without being oily. Â They were served with fresh and creamy ricotta and filets of anchovy. Â The other starter were a special that day, the blistered shishito peppers. Â These were roasted perfectly and added just a touch of both sweetness and heat. The Malfatti is one of my friend's favorites and I can see why. Â The pasta is handmade, wide and flat like pappardelle. Â The shreds of suckling pig were intensely pork flavored and fork tender and the arugula fresh but the most memorable component was the sauce, which was like a silky pork jus. Â It was an enjoyable lunch with very good food.",1
5614,16,4,9/9/2013,"I really enjoyed everything the food, atmosphere, and service. I've tried contadino, frittata bianca and patate(brunch menu). Good portion and very flavorful but NOT salty. Pastries are also excellent. I strongly recommend the toffee glazed brioche bun.",1
4368,16,5,9/9/2013,"My favorite italian spot in nyc. Â First off, they have amazing, in-house made pastas. Â I've had the pappardelle, tonnarelli, and bucatini, and i'm sure the other pastas are just as amazing. Â Secondly, maialino offers great appetizers, including the spicy tripe and the caprese. Â Lastly, and most importantly, is the signature dish, the Maialino. Â It's a large piece of roasted suckling pig, it melts in your mouth, and the crispy pork skin cracklings are definitely a guilty pleasure.",1
5615,16,3,9/8/2013,"Was it because we went for brunch? Fried Artichokes, Fried Tomato Risotto, Carbonara, Olive Oil Cake,Caramel Brioche Out of those five dishes, if I were to go back, I'd get the Fried Tomato Risotto and the Caramel Brioche. Â And sure, the Olive Oil Cake too. The Fried Tomato Risotto was perfectly moist and had a nice balance. Â I wish this was my first, second and third course of the day. Â The risotto was al dente, perfectly cooked and well... bring on some more! The Caramel Brioche was exactly what you'd imagine it to be. Â Sweet and definitely will require you to add some extra minutes at the gym. Â Yum though... will definitely order this again. The olive oil cake, we got for free because well... I think it was pretty obvious that the other dishes were a little rough for us. Â It definitely made up for it! Find Maialino featured on Unique Eats. Â Definitely worth the watch.",1

Â The pate was unimpressive the pork belly had a bad taste. But it was my fault. If I would have ordered something different, I would have had a better time, right?

4187,16,4,9/5/2013,"Maialino is yet another restaurant in Danny Meyer's portfolio and it doesn't disappoint. The restaurant has a spacious bar as well as a comfortable dining area. The decor has an older, rustic feel that made me feel like I was dining in an authentic Italian trattoria. The restaurant is classy without being overbearing or stuffy and would be a good choice for even more casual dinners. Â  As far as food goes, the pasta was extraordinary. My carbonara had the right balance of pepper, pancetta, and cheese and brought out the extraordinary richness that really defines carbonara. As far as I am concerned, I could easily have believed that my I was having pasta at one of Rome's best restaurants. For my main course, I chose the suckling pig special, which was a crispy skin suckling pig over a bed of potatoes. While the pig was delicious and flavorful and the skin had a wonderfully crunchy texture, the dish overall felt a little one-note and heavy and could have used some component to lighten it up. The pig is certainly an experience and worth trying once, but I think the next time I go, I would choose something else. Â  Overall, Maialino is a very excellent restaurant and one that I would gladly revisit whether it be for a work or casual dinner.",1

Â Perhaps I ordered the wrong entree, but Danny Meyer, you can do better! --Mimosa - fresh squeezed OJ w dry prosecco - too dry for my taste --Toffee glazed brioche bun - super sweet but so delicious! This gets 4 stars and I know now that I should have just ordered a basket of these --Porchetta sandwich - extra hard inedible bread with flavorless roast pork and un-seasoned fried eggs. I even tried dipping it in ketchup but it did not help the lack of flavor. I didn't even eat a quarter of it and I usually eat a lot! Really cute decor inside, spacious and not loud. Â Totally agree with the person who said going to the bathroom in the hotel lobby makes you feel like you walked into a vampire's house. Would I come here again? Â Probably not unless I had to be in the area. Hope you have a better experience than me. Enjoy!",1
4312,16,3,8/26/2013,"The reason for coming was because of their pasta dishes, mainly for the cacio e pepe and carbonara. I've been craving for a long time and it must be satisfied. We made no reservations and was asked if we would like to sit at the high table off to the side in the corner because waiting for a table inside would take a while. We didn't mind. Service was slow but it wasn't painstaking unbearable. I mean, at least the waitress remembers we had a bottle of white and keeps refilling our glass. For the food -- Carpaccio - thinly slice beef was good, the olives served with it really made it taste that much better because the beef was bland by itself; salty, savory and meaty - I can do with that Trippa Alla Trasteverina - spicy braised tripe, surprisingly delicious. Tripe was tender and the tomato sauce was really flavorful, put this with some pasta and it would be quite bomb Cacio e Pepe - very heavy cheese flavor, pasta was al dente and had a nice springy consistency to it, I like Carbonara - really nice smokey flavor from the guanciale (think pancetta but from the pig's cheek or jowl), quite creamy, not as al dente as the cacio e pepe but still good This was enough to fill me but apparently not the mister, so you guys, order more. Return rate? Low. But it's a really nice and spacious restaurant. For the restroom, you have to go into the hotel next door. It'll give you that dark and creepy vibe, pretty much like you just entered the mansion of vampires...",1

5620,16,2,8/25/2013,"I came here for brunch on Sunday. The interior is really cute reminding me of a cozy Italian restaurant. The bread they started us out with was delicious and the latte was really good, so I was starting out with high expectations, but I was sorely disappointed. I got the fettucini al carbonara and my husband got the scrambled eggs. The fettucini was oily and tasted flat. The bacon pieces were too big and a bit gross. I tried my husband's scrambled eggs and they were too runny and cheesy. Given that there are a lot of great Italian brunch places in the city, Maialino is not worth going to. I will not be going back. Other similarly priced great alternatives in the area: *Union Square Cafe *ABC Cocina",1

It's welcoming with a touch of sophistication, perfect for a meal with friends, family and even a first date. Secondly, the food was PHENOMENAL! Â I was here for Restaurant Week and normally, I never participate. Typically you get a chicken, fish or beef. Here, they offer TRIPE!B Â Oh yes, I got the stomach lining because why freakin' not? Â It's tripe. It's tough, not all that gamey and covered in a beautiful red tomato sauce. I ate every last bite. I then had the Cavatelli with Rapini, Sausage & Fresno Chilis. Really amazing. It was one of those things where I took a bite and my eyeballs rolled backwards and I said ""Thank you kind server for recommending this awesome dish"". Speaking of server, ours was new to the resto but he was so cool and helpful. A++ === AlgonGirls.com",1

Enjoyed the fresh pastries: Â Olive oil muffin, Honey butter glazed pork biscuit, lemon blueberry scone & pain au chocolat. Â All very fresh, rich and delicious. For entrees we enjoyed the Pepe & Cacio Soft scrambed eggs, Trout with arugula & roasted Hazel nuts, and Papardelle Alla Bolognese with milk braised pork, sage & grana padano. Â All were prepared well. **My only complaint, upon entering the uni-sex restroom area, I was immediately assaulted by the very intense odor of pure ammonia! Â The housekeeper was just leaving the stall, and she must have poured an entire bottle of ammonia everywhere. Â This really took away from what was left of a lovely experience. Â The burning scent was very offensive and awful, my guests could smell the ammonia as soon as I returned to the table. Â We all were quite surprised a Danny Meyer establishemnt does not use Green products for cleaning in this day and age. Â I hope Maialino will address this mishap going forward which brought a rather toxic assault to the ending of what was orignally a civilized afternoon.**",1
5622,16,5,8/18/2013,"This is one special place. I came here in July 2013 for an intimate birthday dinner with my loved ones. Lets talk food first - we could not decide what to order so our lovely waiter suggested the tasting menu. Unlike other tasting menus, this was unpretentious, the servings were huge and each course came with all different flavors. It was great value & definitely the way to go for a group. Next, the service was the best I've had in the city. From the sommelier to each waiter we encountered, everyone was friendly and knowledgable of their menu. All in all, amazing restaurant with a fantastic ambiance & service.",1
5623,16,4,8/18/2013,"Great dinner experience. Â The crispy pork and pasta carbonara with guanciale was delicious! Â Other pastas were pleasing as well. Not knowing much about Maialino other than what we found out on review sites, we picked it for one of our splurge dinners during our NY visit. Â Taking all things into account, we are very happy we went to Maialino.",1
5624,16,4,8/18/2013,We had a RW lunch for 3. This is 2nd time to try their RW lunch. Everything from side breads to dessert was good. Hand made pasta was tasty. Staff was friendly and attentive.,1

Â It took a long time to get our first bottle of wine and we ordered awe one bottle before our entrees came out thinking we would drink it with the entrees and it did not get to our table until we were nearly finished eating. I expected more from a Danny Meyer restaurant.. Highlights of the meal: salumi plate, suckling pig, chocolate croissant bread pudding. Would go back because I'd like to try the brunch and hope to have better service next time.",1
5626,16,2,8/15/2013,"Came to Maialino tonight for a dinner with old work colleagues. Thankfully, my company was fun, and the atmosphere in this restaurant was vibrant. Unfortunately, my good evening was not at all due to the food or service at Maialino. Regarding service, it took a very long time to get service at every stage. A long time to get drink orders taken and then a long time to get food orders taken. I also thought the waiter seemed a bit overly obsessed/pretentious regarding the Italian pronunciation of the dishes. Regarding the food, the dishes themselves did not really impress me. First off, the portions were tiny in general (the guys at the table were openly starving after their entrees). My pasta was actually an ok size for me because I ate half the bread basket beforehand, but I would never recommend this for a hearty dinner or for anyone with a serious appetite. I ordered the Bucatini w/ Spicy Tomato & Guancial for my entree and the olive oil cake for dessert. The pasta dish had wonderful textures (pasta cooked perfectly, etc.), but unfortunately the essence of pork fat from the guancial was just too overpowering for me. It hits your nose from the second the plate is set in front of you. And in addition to the pork being a bit much, I thought the sauce was too spicy, even after I had specifically asked the waiter how spicy it was and he said not at all. However, the saddest moment for me was when I tasted the olive oil cake. I have had very memorable olive oil cakes that melted in my mouth at other establishments, but this one was very dry. I found myself sopping up all the accompanying mascarpone just to try and add some flavor/moisture. Bottom line: I think this place would be awesome for light bites/drinks, as the ambiance and location are great; however, I really couldn't recommend it for a complete meal in NYC.",1
5627,16,3,8/13/2013,"Maialino is very close to my apartment so I went there twice for breakfast. There is no doubt its environment is great, classic European style, bright and clean. But their food is not as good as I thought. I think it might because I'm Asian, and I can't get used to very Italian style? I got the pancake, and it was yummy in the first bite. Unlike American pancakes, there is cheese in it, so I felt it's super greasy after eating one of the two pancakes. Moreover, their croissants are just fine, average. One thing amazing is their coffee! I love their cappuccino! It's beautiful, delicate and great taste. Maybe go again sometimes to just crab a coffee and a croissant.",1
5628,16,5,8/12/2013,"Yum, yum yum. Love coming here for brunch. DELISH.",1
3870,16,4,8/9/2013,"In a flash of brilliance, friends at work made reservations at Maialino for lunch during Restaurant Week. Â So we sauntered from a few blocks away and brightened our day. Â Well, I did. Â First, with a glass of rose. Â Then, with Carciofinni Fritti (fried artichokes and anchovy sauce) and Trota (brook trout, arugula and summer squash). Â Not surprisingly, the trota was fresh and perfectly cooked. Â It was the dessert though that convinced me to return - the lemon verbena panna cotta was sensational! Â We were all friends and were sharing our food but I was tempted to hide my dessert. :) Except for the over-done artichokes, it was worth the $35 prix fixe. My other favorite dish was the Malfatti al Maialino (braised suckling pig and arugula). It was crunchy, tasty and flavorful! Â One thing that Maialino suffers from is the service. Â Everything was so disorganized, like not knowing who ordered what. Â Worse, when the other ladies told the waiter which dishes go to whom, he said: ""Whatever."" Â And because it was disorganized and inefficent, service took forever :( Â Again, this is an issue for the front of the house and has nothing to do with the kitchen. Â I'd still consider coming back but I am hoping service improves.",1
5629,16,3,8/8/2013,"I came here during restaurant week summer 2013, and was not impressed. Â We came early, but without a reservation, and were seated immediately (2 people). Â I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they were offering wine specials for $6 in addition to the restaurant week menu, so we decided to partake in some day-drinking. Â The interior is very nice. Â It felt like I was transported to a quaint countryhouse in Italy. Â I have to admit that the area where we were seated was very awkward though. Â It wasn't awkward for us because we were adjacent to the wall, but every time the server came to our table, she had to maneuver her way around the party sitting next to us, often disrupting their conversation. Â I felt uncomfortable just watching it. With that said, the food itself was mediocre. Â We went with the $25 menu (the $35 menu is offered outside of restaurant week). Â For appetizers, we tried the salad and the salumi misti. Â The salad was disappointing, too much vinegar. Â I wish I had asked them to put the dressing on the side. Â The salumi was very flavorful, however. Â For entrees, we got the stew and the cavatelli. Â Both dishes had too much vinegar, and I'm 99% sure that they were made from the same tomato base -- as in, the base was used as pasta sauce for the pasta, and they just added a cup of water to the base to make the stew. Â I guess that's a savvy way to save money, but at least use a good base! Â No one is a fan of sour pasta or sour stew. Â Finally, for dessert, we tried the olive oil cake and the chocolate cake. Â These were definitely the highlights of the meal! Â I would go back just for the olive oil cake. Â It was very moist, but light at the same time. Â The chocolate cake was quite heavy, but the sour cherries helped cut the heaviness. Â All in all, wonderful desserts, but food was disappointing.",1
5630,16,5,8/7/2013,It doesnt get any better then this. The best Restaurant in NYC. Cant wait to go back. Highly recommended.,1
5631,16,2,8/7/2013,"Went with such high expectations but sadly, as a vegetarian, I was disappointed by their RW menu. For what its worth, this review may only be of interest to vegetarians. We were seated promptly and service was great. The squash starter with ricotta cheese was a fatty over kill. Squash was deep fried, a tad too much for its flavor to get subdued. It was served on a bed of ricotta, swimming in olive oil. Looked nice but way too fatty. Bread basket was nothing to talk about -- in times when bread has become the talk of the meal at fine dining spots, this was no where close. The restaurant switched their RW pasta option for a pesto pasta. Its about the most boring, blah, are you serious this is anything but bland mush I have eaten for pasta. It lacked dimension, texture, taste. The tiny morsels of squash in the pasta were overcooked and barely noticeable because they had no texture or flavor left. The roasted peach dessert was the saving grace of the meal, deliciously refreshing! A restaurant of this calibre can do a much better job of preparing an appealing pasta dish, thats why I was so disappointed.",1
5632,16,5,8/4/2013,All flavors were perfectly combined; they had a good and inexpensive 3 course lunch $25 and $35 menu for 'Restaurant Week' also good choices.,1
5633,16,3,8/4/2013,"I give this place 5 stars for atmosphere, 4 stars for service, but 3 stars for food. It's really well decorated, and has a nice homey feel to it. First, we had the fried artichokes. The texture was great, but to be honest we couldn't really taste anything in the anchovy sauce. Plus, the first few outer leaves of the artichoke were just on the edge of burnt so they were a bit bitter and I had to peel some off. The fried tomato risotto was AMAZING and I would get 5 plates of this for the table if I were you. We also had the carbonara, and while the pasta itself was tasty and cooked well, it just tasted..... a bit bland to us! The guanciale just wasn't smoky like we're used to with bacon. Maybe our palate is just not refined enough and we like typical bold American flavors instead of the simple, well done things in life. But in any case, it was our least favorite dish. The saltimbocca was our second favorite dish! Just a bit acidic but rich and full of flavor. The crust on that prosciutto over the chicken was hard to believe when we bit into it! I'd highly recommend it! 4 stars for service because even though it was bit slow towards the end, our waitress noticed we didn't like the carbonara because we had cleaned all our plates but that one was untouched. We weren't upset about it at all but at the end of our meal she brought a complimentary slice of olive oil cake! What a nice touch for GREAT service! And by the way..... the caramel brioche was the most decadent and delicious pastry I've had all year. You MUST try it!",1
5634,16,5,8/3/2013,"Delicious! The pasta was fantastic: al dente with perfectly flavored sauces. Excellent service in a bright, airy, classy restaurant. I love overlooking the park. On a weekday evening, Maialino was filled with Happy Hour goers in the bar area; you can also find seats in the bar area for dinner service without a reservation. The pasta portions were small enough that you'd want one as an appetizer or two for a meal. The entree we shared was a daily special of the suckling pig shoulder and it was tasty but a ridiculously huge portion; two of us finished maybe 1/2 or 2/3. Very rich. In the future, I'd probably get two pastas rather than a pasta and an entree. The side of spinach was solid, but simple/expected (sauteed in garlic).",1
5635,16,5,8/1/2013,"Fantastic food. Their meals are all so flavorful and the desserts are also killer. The service is great. This is the kind of place where your glass is never empty but you don't see it get refilled. I've only eaten here for lunch, but everything I've tried has lived up to my expectations. Only complaint is that it does have the ability to get expensive really fast.",1
5636,16,5,7/31/2013,"My second time coming without a reservation and getting a seat at the bar with a friend. Second time with same lovely waitress, second time ordering bottle of Foradori's Teroldego red wine. This time discovered (by asking) that I could order GLUTEN FREE pasta and bread. Yum! Had vongole as good as what I get in Italy. Love this place even more now.",1
5637,16,3,7/31/2013,"The food remains excellent, but I must complain that the service here is now frequently distracted and uninvolved. It should not take 10 minutes to place an order and to have my check picked up. Waiters shouldn't bump into my chair and not even mumble an excuse me. It's hard to put a finger on the issues, but while Gramercy Tavern service is perfect, anticipating one's needs and making the whole dining experience seem like a well-constructed dream, Maialino falls far short. I'm applying an unfairly high standard, but for a piece of the Danny Meyer empire, Maialino can't be said to measure up.",1

Had their roast pig special for the table, it was delicious but extremely heavy but i couldn't stop eating the skin. We also had prosciutto, cheese, artichokes (my friend's fave), ravioli (must get this) and spaghetti with clams (friend said this was the best outside the amalfi coast). Â For dessert we split the croissant bread pudding and a sampling of their amari after dinner drinks. Â  Bartenders there were also friendly and patient in finding the perfect drink for you.

Things I could've done without: cod.",1
5642,16,3,7/21/2013,"Clearly not what you would expect from a Danny Meyer restaurant.The issues here from dinner for four were not quality of food related but of all things staff. The waiter was a moron- he had to be asked if there were any specials and in monotone he recited them totally disinterested.His answers to food questions showed clearly he was over his head and the insipid answers provided no direction at all. But was got us most upset was the constant(both from the waiter and the sommelier)attempts to remove wine glasses from the table that were temporarily empty.I do not like my white wine in a bucket of ice and asked that it be left on the table since it was cold enough.Two times the sommelier removed it and stuck it in a bucket on the counter.When we ordered a bottle of red wine the year was different than was on the list.After a half hour the attempted removal of empty glasses began anew even though the bottle was half full. Then there were numerous attempts to remove empty plates even though two of us were still enjoying the entrees.I really felt like we were in the Olive Garden! Again,no quibbles on the quality of food.But after dozens of meals at Gramercy Tavern,Table,Union Square,etc.we were very very much let down with the service. Totally underwhelming experience.",1

The food was delicious...I HIGHLY recommend the Malfatti and I the chocolate croissant bread pudding and hazelnut ice cream. Tip: They're participating in NYC Restaurant this week so check them out!! The one downside was that it was a little loud and some of the tables were a little bit close together, but still, must eat there!",1

Ugh! Their thick-cut bacon is good, but I've never come across any bacon that I didn't like. I must say their pastries are delicious, but you can order these at the front to go - which is what I would recommend. I wanted to see if this place could redeem itself and went back for dinner. The rose they poured was flat... The Bucatini I ordered was average. My boyfriend ordered the Malfatti which was better, but still not amazing. All in all, I gave this place two tries and both times were a huge disappointment. It's a place you go to be seen, but I wouldn't recommend it if you actually like to eat good Italian food. I would recommend In Vino or Lavagna both in the East Village over this place any day.",1
5647,16,4,7/9/2013,Great for parties of all sizes. Â Service was off the hook and the food was just as good. Â One of my best dining experiences in NYC! Can't wait to go back!,1
5648,16,5,7/8/2013,Exceptional brunch. Â Extremely warm and comfortable atmosphere. Â The olive oil muffin was the stand-out in what can only be described as an outstanding pastry basket. Â Would love to be fortunate enough to score dinner reservations the next time I visit Manhattan.,1
5649,16,5,7/6/2013,"Maialino really never disappoints! Great atmosphere, amazing food and an excellent Italian wine list. Their pastas are creative and of high quality. We had their Summer squash pasta and their Malfatti (both were fantastic). Then to top if off we tried their Maialino, which is the best suckling pig I've ever had. Incredibly tender. If you have saved room for desert, then try their chocolate flourless cake. It is to die for!",1
5650,16,5,7/3/2013,"I had an impromptu birthday dinner here last night and was sat at the communal high top. Â It was actually quite nice! No problems with the neighbors. Â The food and ambiance were beautiful. Â Presentation could not have been better, but the most exciting part of the meal was the care. Â It is always said that good food is made great through love and care. Â Equally as important as the food, I felt that level of care was carried through the service. Â I don't know that I have ever had a server who has so smoothly and knowledgeably spoken about the food and wine on the menu. Â It was clear to me that he had a real sense of the preparation and execution of the dishes offered-- it is, of course, an important part of selling ( the not-always-so-secret mission of servers) but his interest in the food was apparent and it felt so good to have this dining experience with him! Â My point is, that there is no way he could have ""faked it to make it."" His knowledge was integrated into his service by way of genuine passion and care. Â So for my experience, the food was beautiful ( loved the okra side as a note- color, balance and texture were all very satisfying) but the service quality is what made it all so dreamy! Â Thank you!",1
5651,16,5,6/26/2013,"Went for brunch, I'll be back for dinner. Had the pig ragu, awesome.",1
5652,16,4,6/17/2013,Maialino is perfect for that impromptu gathering... the walk-in area is comfortable and serves a full dinner/lunch/brunch menu. I would recommend every single cocktail... clearly I have my priorities straight.,1
5653,16,3,6/17/2013,"Came in pretty early as a walk-in around 6:30 on a Saturday. Â We sat in what was designated as the less formal bar area. Â The tables in the area are pretty tightly arranged (almost awkwardly so), so I requested to be seated at a high table with stools and we were accommodated without issue. In short, I felt the pasta was disappointing. Â My spaghettini with clams was more than ordinary, and the cacio e pepe tasted a bit bland. The saving grace was the tripe. Â It is an absolute must-try. Â I've never had tripe that tender. The service is super friendly and the environment and decor is especially nice.",1
5654,16,4,6/16/2013,"I was drawn to try Mialino by it's description of being an authentic Roman style trattoria and the fascinating menu which I rarely see even in NYC. My party was warmly greeted by Roger who kept us informed when our table would be ready. Â It was only a short wait of about 5 minutes at the busiest reservation time of 7 pm. Â The decor was beautiful - subdued but very sophisticated and warm. The tables were generously spaced apart which added to the comfortable experience. I started with one of their signature cocktails. Â (I think it was the Fallen Angel). Â I also finished with the same cocktail because it was so delicious. Â For my appetizer I had the fried artichokes with anchovy dipping sauce. It was amazing. My friend had the salad with cherries and couldn't stop raving about it. For my main dish I had the malfetti - a broad pasta with tender suckling pig and delicious gravy. My friend had the loin lamb chops with the sweet and sour sauce. She said it was one of the most delicious meals she ever had. We split 2 desserts - the chocolate croissant bread pudding and the flour less chocolate cake. Both were accompanied with hazelnut ice cream. I was so focused with eating one of the best meals I ever had that I didn't even notice when our waitress came over to ask how things were. My experience was nearly perfect. I say nearly perfect because I didn't like the restrooms. I'm not a fan of co-ed toilets. Â Most ladies will know what I'm talking about. Â I expected to find a more refined powder room with flowers or at least some lovely potpourri. Â The smell in the stalls was unpleasant - incongruous with the experience we had in the restaurant and with the elegance of The Gramercy Park hotel in general. The sinks and mirrors were in a common area outside the 2 stalls where you might Â find yourself standing next to your date while powdering your nose, fixing your hair or making any other necessary adjustments. Â Also, the wait staff were constantly walking by this open area. I feel they should put up a barrier between the sink area and the kitchen area. Â  I would definitely return many times to Mialino to try all their dishes but hope they will make some aesthetic changes to the restroom area.",1
5655,16,4,6/16/2013,Food was excellent. I went a little nuts on the bread. It was such good bread. I couldnt stop eating it. I was full.before the entree even got there. Be careful.,1
5656,16,4,6/15/2013,"This has been on my ""restaurants to try"" list for awhile and I'm so glad to have finally made it there. Â The space is beautiful- very open and full of light which was great for an early summer evening dinner. Â First thing I judge an Italian restaurant on is the bread basket which they had on point- thick italian loaf and fresh foccacia with crisp breadsticks. Our server was wonderful and was so knowledgeable about the ingredients and way the dishes were prepared- we were happy to take many of his recommendations. Â  For starters, we had the octopus, fried artichokes, and plate of prosciutto and mozzarella. Â We also wanted to try their classic tonarelli cacio e pepe so we shared that plate of pasta as a starter as well. Â I would highly suggest getting any of these- the artichokes were very authentic to roman style cooking and the pasta tasted just like something you'd really eat in Italy. Â  For my entree, I got the olive oil poached cod served with roasted season vegetables which I enjoyed but wasn't that flavorful of a dish. Â It's cod though so I guess that's to be expected with such a mild fish. Â  I tried some of my sister's papardelle bolognese which I loved- the pastas here are really great. Â We got roasted carrots and spinach as side dishes and the carrots were a wonderful side. Â  We shared the chocolate croissant bread pudding (my favorite!!) and the rhubarb and ginger crostata (also awesome!) and our server was kind enough to bring us some of the olive oil gelato to try since we were so intrigued by it. Â All in all, a great meal from start to finish. Excellent wine list and cocktails too!",1
5657,16,4,6/13/2013,get the tripe!!! Â it is by far my favorite dish at maialino :),1
5658,16,3,6/10/2013,"Not terrible, but not great either. The positives: - Service was efficient and friendly. - Got a walkin table without a wait (it was Monday) - The design and layout of the restaurant - The insalata piselli was very tasty - fresh and nicely dressed Negatives: - The focaccia bread brought to the table was close to stale - very tough to eat - The octopus dish, while well prepared, tasted too greasy, crying out for some acid - The carbonara was overpowered by the bacon, could taste nothing else I would not rule out giving this place another chance someday, but I won't be running back anytime soon.",1
5659,16,3,6/9/2013,"Fantastic service, but the food was eh. Â It probably deserves four stars on an objective scale, and I'd be fine going back, but there are plenty of other places that are strictly dominant. I notice that my review is literally the opposite of that of a friend, who liked the food and had bad service. Â So maybe I ordered badly, or maybe it's just an up-and-down place.",1
5660,16,5,6/9/2013,What great vibe for a Wednesday night! We were 15 minutes late for our reservation but hostess was very accommodating in seating us promptly. Â We were fortunate enough to get the sweetest waitress. Â She gave us some delicious recommendations. Â We would never have thought of ordering the chicken but it turned out to be our favorite on the menu. Â The Fallen Angel (taste just like Sangria) was absolutely refreshing. Â Great place for drinks and for people watching. Â Beautiful people all around you. Â Will definitely return the next time we are in NY.,1
5661,16,5,6/9/2013,"For a special occasion, you want to be 100% certain that everything is going to go smoothly and the food is going to be excellent. That combination of flawless service and fantastic food is Danny Meyer's trademark, and this place is no exception. If you want to check it out without breaking the bank, go for lunch, but for goodness sake don't leave New York without giving this place a try!",1
5662,16,4,6/5/2013,"Came in for lunch on a weekday with friend and baby. Â No wait for a table by the window near the bar. Â Perfect for baby away from majority of restaurant. Although it didn't seem too busy, the hostesses seemed a little overwhelmed with the incoming lunch crowd. Â It took over 10 minutes to get a high chair. We, also, had a momentary set back when the server had a weird miscommunication about us eating or not. Â She thought we were only sipping on water and not ordering so we waited for menus and service for 15 mins before finally figuring it out. Â I think the confusion was innocent and aided by the fact that the hostesses didn't communicate our needs. Â She was, overall, a pleasant server. The food was spot on! Â We ordered two dishes to share: Pappardelle with Lamb in a light cream sauce, sage and lemon - $18 The sandwich/salad combo - Italian Dip, porchetta, broccoli rabe, provolone - $15 If we had just ordered pasta entrees I might have been disappointed by the size of the dish. Â It was on the small size. Â The ""salad"" was small too - just a handful of greens in a light lemon vinaigrette. Â But TOGETHER, it was a very filling meal and completely satisfying. Â The lamb pasta dish was amazing, light, and had the zing of lamb and lemon. Â The sandwich was super tasty with the broccoli rabe giving a hint of bitterness. I can definitely see myself returning for a luxury lunch.",1
2289,16,4,6/2/2013,"Solid brunch option in Gramercy. We originally wanted to try out Gramercy Terrace, but since they were closed early (for an event?), we were redirected to Maialino downstairs. Menu is not quite a conventional brunch menu. You can't really find any of the classics like eggs benedict, but there are major sections of the menu for other kinds of eggs and for pasta as well. I got the eggs done ""cacio e pepe"" style, which was a pretty unique way of preparing eggs that I had never really considered before. I also had a side of the bacon; definitely in the ""artisanal"" bacon category, but definitely some of the tastier bacon I've ever had. A friend got the trout dish which she seemed fairly pleased by. Another plus is the service; very attentive waiters that made sure our coffee/tea mugs were never empty. Perhaps a little bit pricier than other brunch spots, but food quality is definitely there.",1
5663,16,3,5/28/2013,"Great service and beautiful venue, but the food itself was lacking. Aside from the fried artichoke appetizer, nothing really stood out and some dishes (hanger steak, lamb) left much to be desired.",1
5664,16,5,5/20/2013,"Came in for dinner based upon a recommendation from our son and he hit it out of the park! We did not have a reservation but found seats at the bar where we ordered a bottle of Campi Flegreilo to work on while awaiting a table. Two things jumped out and said ""this is a great establishment"" ... First of, the hostess and host were happy to take our names for a table and invited us to wait in the bar area. Then they came back twice and apologized for the long wait. Very nice - and we only waited 35 minutes. Second, the bartender was nice enough, after opening our wine proceeded to replace the bottle when he felt that the wine was close to being corked. Our meals were both delicious. We started with the Beef Carpaccio and it was very, very good. We then had the Bucatini and Pappardelle for our entrees and they were perfect. No leftovers here since the serving size was just right. Dessert consisted of a shared Tartufo which was also excellent.",1
2742,16,4,5/18/2013,"Came here for a 2pm brunch on a Sunday. Â We didn't have ar reservation but they were able to seat us right away. We ended up splitting the Suppli al Telefono (Tomato Risotto Croquettes & Mozzarella) and then I ordered the Al Piacere (Two Eggs any Style, Potatoes & Mixed Greens). I got my eggs over medium. It was a straightforward dish and I enjoyed the service and the food.",1
5665,16,5,5/13/2013,Dining at Danny Meyer's Maialino with Denise & Adam Lipson was absolutely sublime.,1
5666,16,4,5/8/2013,"The food here is so amazing and so interesting, I can't wait to go back again. I want to order everything and try it all. I had the veal heart which might make some people squeamish but you need to try it. Not mineral-y Â at all and the beet reduction was amazing. It is honestly one of the best dishes I have ever tasted in my life. Â The chef there (Anderer) deserves a lot of praise. The one star off was for the wait staff. Nice but kind of out of it. Not polished, not attentive.",1
5667,16,5,5/8/2013,Great place! I loved everything I had specially the sucking pig! The service was great!,1
5668,16,5,5/4/2013,i'd my last lunch here in NYC during the last spring visit. cool waiter. [but there is an affected-looking maitre'd who probably just moved from NJ ;-) Â  ]it's a welcoming venue within the posh/hip gramercy park hotel [go check the lobby and the bar...] maialino serves memorable updated hearty roman cuisine. their lunch prix fixe menu is a good deal.,1
5669,16,5,5/1/2013,"Fantastic experience at Maialino. Our waiter rocked, I forgot your name (too much wine) but my heart sings you praises! The quality of food here is amazing and the service provided here is gold. The waiters here are very knowledgable; you tell them the type of wine you like they can bring you out several bottles to taste LOVE, and our waiter was not at all bothered about questions we had on the menu she even suggested things which was perfect! The stand out in my meal was the Robiola Cheese it was just heaven and Flourless chocolate cake & buttermilk gelato I am dreaming about =) for my entree my friend and I shared the ravioli and the octopus pasta so delicious! I really cannot wait to come back!",1
5670,16,5,4/24/2013,"One of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan. This is Danny Meyer at his finest, taking a semi-subterranean space on an offbeat block of midtown south and turning into one of the greatest restaurants in New York City. Maialino gets everything right - from the minute they answer your phone call until after the check drops. Every detail is accounted for, including the perfect crispness of the dazzling sweetbread appetizer, the bright and acidic balance of the house white wines, and the hauntingly chewy perfection of the homemade pastas. For someone like myself who generally avoids Manhattan at all costs, it's refreshing to know that there is still a reason to go there for reasonably-priced special occasions. Maialino has surpassed my expectations time and time again, and I can't wait until the day when I can afford to go back.",1
5671,16,5,4/23/2013,I've been to Maialino twice for brunch and had the Porchetta both times - it's that good! The egg is runny and mixes so well with each bite you take of the perfectly seasoned pork which makes it the perfect breakfast sandwich. I can't wait to go back!,1
5672,16,1,4/17/2013,"Was expecting better since its a ""Meyers"" restaurant... Where do I begin? The portions were tiny, completely over priced, and had no flavor. this place is overrated and pretentious.",1
5673,16,4,4/16/2013,Nice atmosphere. Good food. Great breakfast menu. Their house sausage is excellent.,1
5674,16,5,4/10/2013,"Raviolo Al Uovo here is amazing, and be sure to try the the gelato drowned in espresso. Craig is the best barista in town.",1
5675,16,4,4/9/2013,"I only came in here looking for dessert, but I'm definitely returning for dinner soon. The location is in the Gramercy Park Hotel, so come prepared to spend some money. We had a few glasses of dessert wine, dessert and coffee and this alone set us back about $35 each (tax and tip included). The service is friendly and professional. My ""Torta della Nonna"" was a custard tart covered with pine nuts and powdered sugar that brought me back to my visit in Siena, Italy many years ago. That alone makes me want to return here. It's not easy finding any Italian restaurant that prepares a good cup of espresso ""ristretto"", and here they do. In fact, I had a second cup before we left. My compliments to all!",1
5676,16,4,4/8/2013,"Came here for breakfast with my friends on Monday. Â Having heard about the place on food network and various breakfast lists online, I wanted to check the place out. Â  Me personally, I'm a big fan of brunch/breakfast when the food is something other than an omelette, pancake, or waffle. Â  With that criteria in mind, Maialino was perfect place. Â  Apparently being known for their eggs, that's what all three of us got- two for the contadina, one for the frittata. Â  The contadina consisted of poached eggs, carrots, sunchokes and escarole. Â The frittata was unlike any frittata I've seen before. Â It wasn't heavy at all. Â This one was egg whites only, hence the name frittata bianca. Â It was served with potatoes, roasted onions and artichokes. Â For sides the three of us split a chocolate croissant and pancetta. Â  For those that don't like eggs, there were other choices such as sandwiches and salads. Â Everything on the menu was something I could have ordered; so much variety. Â  Overall, I really enjoyed the meal. Â I didn't leave stuffed but was very satisfied. Â I want to go back and try out their dinner!",1
5677,16,5,4/7/2013,"I've never been a big fan of a sommelier. Â  Someone who can point you to an expensive bottle that doesn't match your desire? No thanks. But Maialino changed that for me and showed me what a great sommelier can do. Â After we talked a bit with our likes and dislikes, he narrowed in to a bottle of wine from the Piedmont of Italy that has to be one of best wines I've drunk. Really. Â Sometimes, bottles can get worse with the second or third glass. But this bottle just got better with time. And low on tannins. Just magnificent. Â  So, for that alone, it deserves five stars. Fortunately, the food and service and atmosphere matched up with the rest. Â We started with some cheese and meats. Â We particularly like the Maialino meats that are made in NYC too. Â  Then, we moved on to a fresh artichokes which are in season now. Artichokes are extraordinarily hard to make for such little product. And yet, these were fried artichokes unlike any that I've had before. (Can't say I'm typically a fan either though my wife LOVES them.) But these artichokes are something you can enjoy. And with the anchovy sauce too, it was a real winner. For main dishes, we had some of the pastas -- a rabbit ragu and the suckling pig. Both were not too heavy with a portion size that didn't leave you bloated. The pig was really tender and had been cooked for a while. Â But have to say that I loved the rabbit too. So many choices. Â  We skipped the ""main dishes"" in favor of the pastas. Â Which was good, because it left us room for dessert and you're going to want to leave room in for the bread pudding. Yummy. Â  A real winner here. Â Well worth the money and well worth the effort to make a reservation well in advance (we did nearly a month prior and they were kind enough to give us a great table.)",1
5678,16,4,4/7/2013,"Had a very nice dinner experience last month. The ambiance was that of an upscale but rustic farmhouse. The service was informed and attentive without being too formal. Menu and specials were plentiful and innovative. We did share the pig face and the veal heart salad, both were very good and it was an opportunity to have something not offered elsewhere. The pastas were also great, creative pairing of ingredients. If I had a criticism it would be that the pasta portions were on the small side. Sommelier was also informed and helpful. Desserts all around the table were delicious. The only thing short of 5 stars is the over seasoned mackerel and the lack of more interesting breads in the basket, a small price to pay for a wonderful dinner in a warm and inviting farmhouse!",1
5679,16,4,4/4/2013,"Had amazing pasta that was a special, pasta covered in butter, cream, and black truffles. It was SO GOOD. For dessert there was incredible peach pie with vanilla gelato. Very friendly wait staff",1
5680,16,4,4/3/2013,"Went there for dinner on a Saturday. Tip: This place is always packed so make reservation at least one week in advance. Ambiance: Mixture of trendy, fancy with a touch of traditional Italian. Â  Crowd was mostly people in their late 30s and up. Food: The bread that is set on the table is delicious and I love that they place olive oil and not butter (so reminds me of Italy). For appetizers we had 3 cheeses (pecorino, formagetta and parmigiano) and prosciutto and it was all very good although I wished the portions were bigger (but I guess this is how Italians stay slim- small portions). For Primi, I had Spaghettini alle vongole (with clams) and it was tasty. Â My friend had the Spaghetti alle Chitarra and he seemed to love it and just wished the portions were bigger (we came quite hungry). For Secondi I had the Stripped bass which in my opinion needed some seasoning, thankfully, they had sea salt on the table, so I added some. My friend had the Hanger steak and it was deeelicious, I wish I had ordered this! Drinks: We had the Primitivo and Ettna Rosso; Light and full body in that order. Service: It seems like after he took our order our waiter went MIA and every time we had food delivered to the table it was a different person, but I guess it doesn't really matter as long as we got what we ordered? Price: Expensive... not that it wasn't worth it, but I think if it would had cost a little less it would had been perfect. Would I go back? Yes",1
5681,16,5,4/1/2013,"Phenomenal and approachable Italian cuisine. Very close to what my mom makes. Pork belly, Jewish artichokes were both incredible.",1
5682,16,5,3/31/2013,"Been wanting to get into this place for ages, really hard to get spots at 8-9pm so we booked the 28 days in advance! We were greeted and offered to hang our jackets. The table was ready too. The service was great - the wine was served perfectly - which we can be very fussy about- too many places overfill the glass. Great time between courses and nice sized portions on a lovely varied list. We had their special suckling pig with roasted veg, amazing. We ordered the side of chard with mildly chilli spiced, perfect accompaniment. Would def recommend and def go back. Have a cocktail in the Rose Bar in the hotel before. perfect.",1
